<caption>PREFACE.</caption>
<p ln="[1]"><hi r="smcap">In</hi> preparing this work for publication it seems
proper to offer some observations explanatory of
its design. The classical reader will perceive the
obstacles which necessarily presented themselves
in reconciling the nature of the subject with such
a manner of treating it as should appear the most
poetical, and at the same time the most likely to
arrive at that degree of dignity and usefulness to
which it ought to aspire.</p>
<p ln="[2]">The Columbiad is a patriotic poem; the subject
is national and historical. Thus far it must be
interesting to my countrymen. But most of the
events were so recent, so important and so well
known, as to render them inflexible to the hand
of fiction. The poem, therefore, could not with
<pb n="vi">
propriety be modelled after that regular epic form
which the more splendid works of this kind have
taken, and on which their success is supposed in
a great measure to depend. The attempt would
have been highly injudicious; it must have diminished
and debased a series of actions which were
really great in themselves and could not be disfigured
without losing their interest.</p>
<p ln="[3]">I shall enter into no discussion on the nature
of the epopea, nor attempt to prove by any
latitude of reasoning that I have written an Epic
Poem. The subject indeed is vast; far superior
to any of those on which the celebrated poems
of this description have been constructed; and I
have no doubt but the form I have given to the
work is the best that the subject would admit.
It may be added, that in no poem are the unities
of time, place and action more rigidly observed:
the action, in the technical sense of the word,
consisting only of what takes place between
Columbus and Hesper; which must be supposed
to occupy but few hours, and is confined to the
prison and the mount of vision.</p>
<pb n="vii">
<p ln="[4]">But these circumstances of classical regularity
are of little consideration in estimating the real
merit of any work of this nature. Its merit must
depend on the importance of the action, the disposition
of the parts, the invention and application
of incidents, the propriety of the illustrations, the
liveliness and chastity of the images, the suitable
intervention of machinery, the moral tendency
of the manners, the strength and sublimity of the
sentiments; the whole being clothed in language
whose energy, harmony and elegance shall constitute
a style every where suited to the matter
they have to treat.</p>
<p ln="[5]">It is impossible for me to determine how far I
may have succeeded in any of these particulars.
This must be decided by others, the result of
whose decision I shall never know. But there
is one point of view in which I wish the reader
to place the character of my work, before he
pronounces on its merit: I mean its political
tendency. There are two distinct objects to be
kept in view in the conduct of a narrative poem:
the <hi r="italic">poetical</hi> object and the <hi r="italic">moral</hi> object. The
<pb n="viii">
poetical is the fictitious design of the action; the
moral is the real design of the poem.</p>
<p ln="[6]">In the Iliad of Homer the poetical object is to
kindle, nourish, sustain and allay the anger of
Achilles. This end is constantly kept in view;
and the action proper to attain it is conducted
with wonderful judgment thro a long series of
incidents, which elevate the mind of the reader,
and excite not only a veneration for the creative
powers of the poet, but an ardent emulation of
his heroes, a desire to imitate and rival some of
the great actors in the splendid scene; perhaps
to endeavor to carry into real life the fictions
with which we are so much enchanted.</p>
<p ln="[7]">Such a high degree of interest excited by the
first object above mentioned, the fictitious design
of the action, would make it extremely important
that the second object, the real design of the
poem, should be beneficial to society. But the
real design in the Iliad was directly the reverse.
Its obvious tendency was to inflame the minds
of young readers with an enthusiastic ardor for
military fame; to inculcate the pernicious doctrine
<pb n="ix">
of the divine right of kings; to teach both prince
and people that military plunder was the most
honorable mode of acquiring property; and that
conquest, violence and war were the best employment
of nations, the most glorious prerogative
of bodily strength and of cultivated mind.</p>
<p ln="[8]">How much of the fatal policy of states, and
of the miseries and degradations of social man,
have been occasioned by the false notions of
honor inspired by the works of Homer, it is
not easy to ascertain. The probability is, that
however astonishing they are as monuments
of human intellect, and how long soever they
have been the subject of universal praise, they
have unhappily done more harm than good.
My veneration for his genius is equal to that of
his most idolatrous readers; but my reflections
on the history of human errors have forced upon
me the opinion that his existence has really
proved one of the signal misfortunes of mankind.</p>
<p ln="[9]">The moral tendency of the Eneid of Virgil is
nearly as pernicious as that of the works of
<pb n="x">
Homer. Its poetical or fictitious design, the
settlement of his hero in Italy, is well delineated
and steadily pursued. This object must have
been far more interesting to the Romans than
the anger of Achilles could have been to the
Greeks. Had Virgil written his poem one or
two centuries earlier than he did, while his
countrymen felt that they had a country and
were not themselves the property of a master,
they must have glowed with enthusiasm in reciting
the fabulous labors of their ancestors, and
adored the songster who could have thus elevated
so endearing a subject; who could have adorned
it with such an interesting variety of incidents,
such weight of pathos, such majesty of sentiment
and harmony of verse. But Virgil wrote and
felt like a subject, not like a citizen. The real
design of his poem was to increase the veneration
of the people for a master, whoever he might be,
and to encourage like Homer the great system of
military depredation.</p>
<p ln="[10]">Lucan is the only republican among the ancient
<pb n="xi">
epic poets. But the action of his rambling tho
majestic poem is so badly arranged as to destroy,
in a poetical sense, the life and interest of the great
national subject on which it is founded; at the
same time that it abounds in the most exalted
sentiments and original views of manners, highly
favorable to the love of justice and the detestation
of war. If a mind, formed like that of Lucan, as
to its moral and political cast, and endowed with
the creative energy of Homer, had sung to the
early Greeks the fall of Troy or the labors of
Hercules, his work (taking the place which those
of Homer have unfortunately occupied) as a
splendid model for all succeeding ages, would
have given a very different turn to the pursuits
of heroes and the policy of nations. Ambition
might then have become an useful passion, instead
of a destructive disease.</p>
<p ln="[11]">In the poem here presented to the public the
objects, as in other works of the kind, are two:
the fictitious object of the action and the real
object of the poem. The first of these is to sooth
and satisfy the desponding mind of Columbus;
<pb n="xii">
to show him that his labors, tho ill rewarded by
his cotemporaries, had not been performed in
vain; that he had opened the way to the most
extensive career of civilization and public happiness;
and that he would one day be recognised
as the author of the greatest benefits to the human
race. This object is steadily kept in view; and
the actions, images and sentiments are so disposed
as probably to attain the end. But the real object
of the poem embraces a larger scope: it is to
inculcate the love of rational liberty, and to
discountenance the deleterious passion for violence
and war; to show that on the basis of
the republican principle all good morals, as well
as good government and hopes of permanent
peace, must be founded; and to convince the
student in political science that the theoretical
question of the future advancement of human
society, till states as well as individuals arrive at
universal civilization, is held in dispute and still
unsettled only because we have had too little experience
of organised liberty in the government
of nations to have well considered its effects.</p>
<pb n="xiii">
<p ln="[12]">I cannot expect that every reader, nor even
every republican reader, will join me in opinion
with respect to the future progress of society and
the civilization of states; but there are two sentiments
in which I think all men will agree: that
the event is desirable, and that to believe it practicable
is one step towards rendering it so. This
being the case they ought to pardon a writer, if
not applaud him, for endeavoring to inculcate
this belief.</p>
<p ln="[13]">I have taken the liberty, notwithstanding the
recency of the events, to make some changes in
the order of several of the principal battles described
in this poem. I have associated the actions
of Starke, Herkimer, Brown and Francis in the
battle of Saratoga, tho they happened at some
distance from that battle, both as to time and
place. A like circumstance will be noticed with
respect to Sumter, Jackson of Georgia and some
others in the battle of Eutaw. I have supposed
a citadel mined and blown up in the siege of
York, and two ships of war grappled and blown
up in the naval battle of De Grasse and Graves.
<pb n="xiv">
It is presumed that these circumstances require
no apology; as in the two latter cases the events
are incidental to such situations, and they here
serve the principal purpose, being meant to increase
our natural horror for the havoc and miseries
of war in general. And with regard to the
two former cases we ought to consider that, in
the epic field, the interest to be excited by the
action cannot be sustained by following the
gazette, as Lucan has done. The desultory parts
of the historical action must be brought together
and be made to elevate and strengthen each other,
so as to press upon the mind with the full force
of their symmetry and unity. Where the events
are recent and the actors known, the only duty
imposed by that circumstance on the poet is to
do them historical justice, and not ascribe to one
hero the actions of another. But the scales of
justice in this case are not necessarily accompanied
by the calendar and the map.</p>
<p ln="[14]">It will occur to most of my readers that the
modern modes of fighting, as likewise the instruments
and terms now used in war, are not yet
<pb n="xv">
rendered familiar in poetical language. It is
doubtless from an unwarrantable timidity, or
want of confidence in their own powers of description,
that modern poets have made so little
use of this kind of riches that lay before them.
I confess that I imbibed the common prejudice,
and remained a long time in the error of supposing
that the ancients had a poetical advantage over us
in respect to the dignity of the names of the
weapons used in war, if not in their number and
variety. And when I published a sketch of the
present poem, under the title of The Vision of
Columbus, I labored under the embarrassment
of that idea. I am now convinced that the advantage,
at least as to the weapons, is on the
side of the moderns. There are better sounding
names and more variety in the instruments, works,
stratagems and other artifices employed in our
war system than in theirs. In short, the modern
military dictionary is more copious than the ancient,
and the words at least as poetical.</p>
<p ln="[15]">As to the mode of fighting, we have, poetically
speaking, lost something in one respect, but we
<pb n="xvi">
have gained much in another. Our battles indeed
admit but few single combats, or trials of individual
prowess. They do admit them, however;
and it is not impossible to describe them with
as much detail and interest as the nature of the
action requires; as Voltaire has proved in the single
combat of Aumale and Turenne in the Henriad.
Had he managed his general descriptions and the
other parts of the conduct of his poem as well,
he would have made it a far more interesting
work than he has. However, since our single
combats must be insignificant in their consequences,
not deciding any thing as to the result
of the battle, it would be inconvenient and
misplaced to make much use of them in our
descriptions. And here lies our disadvantage,
compared with the ancients.</p>
<p ln="[16]">But in a general engagement, the shock of modern
armies is, beyond comparison, more magnificent,
more sonorous and more discoloring to
the face of nature, than the ancient could have
been; it is consequently susceptible of more pomp
and variety of description. Our heaven and earth
<pb n="xvii">
are not only shaken and tormented with greater
noise, but filled and suffocated with fire and
smoke. If Homer, with his Grecian tongue and
all its dialects, had had the battle of Blenheim
to describe, the world would have possessed a
picture and a piece of music which it will never
possess. The description would have astonished
all ages, and enriched every language into which
it might have been translated.</p>
<p ln="[17]">With regard to naval battles the moderns have
altogether the advantage. But there has been no
naval battle described in modern poetry; neither
is there any remaining to us from the ancients,
except that in the bay of Marseilles by Lucan,
and that near Syracuse by Silius. It would seem
strange indeed that Homer, whose wonderful
powers of fiction were not embarrassed by historical
realities, and who in other respects is so
insatiable of variety, did not introduce a sea fight
either in the defence of Troy or in the disastrous
voyages of Ulysses. But the want of this
in Homer's two poems amounts almost to a proof
that in his time the nations had not yet adopted
<pb n="xviii">
any method of fighting at sea; so that the poet
could have no such image in his mind.</p>
<p ln="[18]">The business of war, with all its varieties, makes
but a small part of the subject of my poem; it
ought therefore to occupy but a small portion of
its scenery. This is the reason why I have not
been more solicitous to vary and heighten the
descriptions of battles and other military operations.
I make this observation to satisfy those
readers who being accustomed to see a long poem
chiefly occupied with this sort of bustle conceive
that the life and interest of such compositions
depend upon it. How far the majesty or interest
of epic song really depends upon the tumultuous
conflicts of war I will not decide; but I can
assure the reader, so far as my experience goes,
that these parts of the work are not the most
difficult to write. They are scenes that exhibit
those vigorous traits of human character which
strike the beholder most forcibly and leave the
deepest impression. They delight in violent attitudes;
and, painting themselves in the strongest
colors on the poet's fancy, they are easy at any
<pb n="xix">
time to recal. He varies them at pleasure, he
adorns them readily with incidents, and imparts
them with spirit to the reader.</p>
<p ln="[19]">My object is altogether of a moral and political
nature. I wish to encourage and strengthen, in
the rising generation, a sense of the importance
of republican institutions; as being the great
foundation of public and private happiness, the
necessary aliment of future and permanent meliorations
in the condition of human nature.</p>
<p ln="[20]">This is the moment in America to give such a
direction to poetry, painting and the other fine
arts, that true and useful ideas of glory may be
implanted in the minds of men here, to take place
of the false and destructive ones that have degraded
the species in other countries; impressions
which have become so wrought into their most
sacred institutions, that it is there thought impious
to detect them and dangerous to root them
out, tho acknowledged to be false. Wo be to
the republican principle and to all the institutions
it supports, when once the pernicious doctrine of
the holiness of error shall creep into the creed of
<pb n="xx">
our schools and distort the intellect of our citizens.</p>
<p ln="[21]">The Columbiad, in its present form, is such as
I shall probably leave it to its fate. Whether it
be destined to survive its author, is a question that
gives me no other concern than what arises from
the most pure and ardent desire of doing good to
my country. To my country, therefore, with
every sentiment of veneration and affection, I
dedicate my labors.</p></prologue>

<caption>INTRODUCTION.</caption>
<p ln="[22]"><hi r="smcap">Every</hi> circumstance relating to the discovery and settlement
of America is an interesting object of inquiry,
especially to the great and growing nations of this
hemisphere, who owe their existence to those arduous
labors. Yet it is presumed that many persons, who
might be entertained with a poem on this subject, are
but slightly acquainted with the life and character of the
hero whose extraordinary genius led him to discover
the continent, and whose singular sufferings, arising
from that service, ought to excite the indignation of
the world.</p>
<p ln="[23]">Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa about
the year 1447, when the navigation of Europe was
scarcely extended beyond the limits of the Mediterranean
and the other narrow seas that border the great
ocean. The mariner's compass had been invented and
<pb n="xxii">
in common use for more than a century; yet with the
help of this sure guide, and prompted by a laudable
spirit of discovery, the mariners of those days rarely
ventured from the sight of land. They acquired wonderful
applause by sailing along the coast of Africa, and
discovering some of the neighboring islands; and
after pushing their researches with great industry for
half a century, the Portuguese, who were the most
fortunate and enterprising, extended their voyages
southward no further than the equator.</p>
<p ln="[24]">The rich commodities of the East had, for several
ages, been brought into Europe by the Red Sea and
the Mediterranean; and it had now become the object
of the Portuguese to find a passage to India by sailing
round the southern extremity of Africa, and then
taking an eastern course. This great object engaged
the general attention, and drew into the Portuguese
service adventurers from the other maritime nations
of Europe. Every year added to their experience in
navigation, and seemed to promise some distant reward
to their industry. The prospect, however, of arriving at
India by that route was still by no means encouraging.
Fifty years' perseverance in the same track having
brought them only to the equator, it was probable
that as many more would elapse before they could
accomplish their purpose.</p>
<pb n="xxiii">
<p ln="[25]">But Columbus, by an uncommon exertion of genius,
formed a design no less astonishing to the age in which
he lived than beneficial to posterity. This design was
to sail to India by taking a western direction. By the
accounts of travellers who had visited that part of Asia,
it seemed almost without limits on the east; and by
attending to the spherical figure of the earth, Columbus
drew the natural conclusion, that the Atlantic ocean
must be bounded on the west either by India itself,
or by some continent not far distant from it.</p>
<p ln="[26]">This illustrious navigator, who was then about
twenty&hyphen;seven years of age, appears to have possessed
every talent requisite to form and execute the greatest
enterprises. He was early educated in such of the
useful sciences as were taught in that day. He had
made great proficiency in geography, astronomy and
drawing, as they were necessary to his favorite pursuit
of navigation. He had been a number of years in
the service of the Portuguese, and had acquired all the
experience that their voyages and discoveries could
afford. His courage had been put to the severest test;
and the exercice of every amiable as well as heroic
virtue, the kindred qualities of a great mind, had secured
him an extensive reputation. He had married a Portuguese
lady, by whom he had two sons, Diego and
<pb n="xxiv">
Ferdinand; the younger of these is the historian of
his father's life.</p>
<p ln="[27]">Such was the situation of Columbus, when he formed
and digested a plan, which, in its operation and consequences,
has unfolded to the view of mankind one
half of the globe, diffused wealth and industry over
the other, and is extending commerce and civilization
thro the whole. To corroborate the theory he had
formed of the existence of a western continent, his
discerning mind, which knew the application of every
circumstance that fell in his way, had observed several
facts which by others would have passed unnoticed.
In his voyages to the African islands he had found,
floating ashore after a long western storm, pieces of
wood carved in a curious manner, canes of a size
unknown in that quarter of the world, and human
bodies with very singular features.</p>
<p ln="[28]">The opinion being well established in his mind that
a considerable portion of the earth still remained to
be discovered, his temper was too vigorous and persevering
to suffer an idea of this importance to rest
merely in speculation, as it had done with Plato and
Seneca, who seem to have entertained conjectures of
a similar nature. He determined, therefore, to bring
his theory to the test of experiment. But an object
<pb n="xxv">
of that magnitude required the patronage of a prince;
and a design so extraordinary met with all the obstructions
that an age of superstition could invent,
and personal jealousy enhance.</p>
<p ln="[29]">It is happy for mankind that, in this instance, a genius
capable of devising the greatest undertakings associated
in itself a degree of patience and enterprise, modesty
and confidence, which rendered him superior to these
misfortunes, and enabled him to meet with fortitude
all the future calamities of his life. Excited by an ardent
enthusiasm to become a discoverer of new countries,
and fully sensible of the advantages that would result
to mankind from such discoveries, he had the cruel
mortification to wear away eighteen years of his life,
after his system was well established in his own mind,
before he could obtain the means of executing his
projected voyage. The greatest part of this period
was spent in successive solicitations in Genoa, Portugal
and Spain.</p>
<p ln="[30]">As a duty to his native country he made his first
proposal to the senate of Genoa, where it was soon
rejected. Conscious of the truth of his theory, and
of his own abilities to execute his plan, he retired
without dejection from a body of men who were
incapable of forming any just ideas upon the subject,
and applied with fresh confidence to John Second,
<pb n="xxvi">
king of Portugal, who had distinguished himself as
the great patron of navigation, and in whose service
Columbus had acquired a reputation which entitled
him and his project to general confidence. But here
he experienced a treatment much more insulting than
a direct refusal. After referring the examination of
his scheme to the council who had the direction of
naval affairs, and drawing from him his general ideas
of the length of the voyage and the course he meant
to take, that splendid monarch had the meanness to
conspire with the council to rob Columbus of the
glory and advantage he expected to derive from his
undertaking. While Columbus was amused with the
negotiation, in hopes of having his scheme adopted,
a vessel was secretly dispatched by order of the king
to make the intended discovery. Want of skill or
courage in the pilot rendered the plot unsuccessful;
and Columbus, on discovering the treachery, retired
with an ingenuous indignation from a court which
could be capable of such duplicity.</p>
<p ln="[31]">Having now performed what was due to the country
that gave him birth, and to the one that had adopted
him as a subject, he was at liberty to court the patronage
of any other which should have the wisdom
to accept his proposals. He had communicated his
ideas to his brother Bartholomew, whom he sent to
<pb n="xxvii">
England to negotiate with Henry Seventh; at the
same time he went himself into Spain to apply in
person to Ferdinand and Isabella, who governed the
united kingdoms of Arragon and Castile.</p>
<p ln="[32]">The circumstances of his brother's application in
England, which appears to have been unsuccessful, are
not to my purpose to relate; and the limits prescribed
to this biographical sketch will prevent the detail of
particulars respecting his own negotiation in Spain.
This occupied him eight years; in which the various
agitations of suspense, expectation and disappointment
must have borne hard upon his patience. At length
his scheme was adopted by Isabella; who undertook,
as queen of Castile, to defray the expenses of the
expedition, and declared herself ever after the friend
and patron of the hero who projected it.</p>
<p ln="[33]">Columbus, who during his ill success in the negotiation
never abated any thing of the honors and
emoluments which he expected to acquire in the expedition,
obtained from Ferdinand and Isabella a
stipulation of every article contained in his first proposals.
He was constituted high admiral and viceroy
of all the seas, islands and continents which he should
discover; with power to receive one tenth of the
profits arising from their productions and commerce;
<pb n="xxviii">
which offices and emoluments were to be made hereditary
in his family.</p>
<p ln="[34]">These articles being adjusted, the preparations for
the voyage were brought forward with rapidity; but
they were by no means adequate to the importance of
the expedition. Three small vessels, scarcely sufficient
in size to be employed in the coasting business, were
appointed to traverse the vast Atlantic, and to encounter
the storms and currents always to be expected
in tropical climates, uncertain seasons and unknown
seas. These vessels, as we must suppose them in the
infancy of navigation, were ill constructed, in a poor
condition, and manned by seamen unaccustomed to
distant voyages. But the tedious length of time which
Columbus had passed in solicitation and suspense, and
the prospect of being able soon to obtain the object
of his wishes, induced him to overlook what he could
not easily remedy, and led him to disregard those
circumstances which would have intimidated any other
mind. He accordingly equipped his small squadron
with as much expedition as possible, manned with
ninety men and victualled for one year. With these,
on the third of August 1492, amidst a vast crowd of
spectators, he set sail on an enterprise which, if we
consider the ill condition of his ships, the inexperience
<pb n="xxix">
of his sailors, the length and precarious nature of his
voyage and the consequences that flowed from it, was
the most daring and important that ever was undertaken.
He touched at some of the Portuguese settlements
in the Canary isles; where, although he had
been but a few days at sea, he found his vessels needed
refitting. He soon made the necessary repairs, and
took his departure from the westermost islands that
had hitherto been discovered. Here he left the former
track of navigation, and steered his course due west.</p>
<p ln="[35]">Not many days after he laid this course he perceived
the symptoms of a new scene of difficulty. The sailors
now began to contemplate the dangers and uncertain
issue of a voyage, the nature and length of which
were left entirely open to conjecture. Besides the
fickleness and timidity natural to men unaccustomed to
the discipline of a seafaring life, several circumstances
contributed to inspire an obstinate and mutinous disposition,
which required the most consummate art as well
as fortitude in the admiral to control. Having been
three weeks at sea, and experienced the uniform course
of the tradewinds, they contended that, should they
continue the same course for a longer time, the same
winds would never permit them to return to Spain.
The magnetic needle began to vary its direction. This
being the first time that this phenomenon was ever
<pb n="xxx">
noticed, it was viewed by the sailors with astonishment;
they thought it an indication that nature itself had
changed its laws, and that Providence was about to
punish their audacity in venturing so far beyond the
bounds of man. They declared that the commands
of the government had been fully obeyed in their
proceeding so many days in the same course, and so
far surpassing all former navigators in quest of discoveries.</p>
<p ln="[36]">Every talent requisite for governing, soothing and
tempering the passions of men is conspicuous in the
conduct of Columbus on this occasion. The dignity
and affability of his manners, his surprising knowledge
and experience in naval affairs, his unwearied and
minute attention to the duties of his command, gave
him a great ascendency over the minds of his men,
and inspired that degree of confidence which would
have maintained his authority in almost any circumstances.
But here, from the nature of the undertaking,
every man had leisure to feed his imagination with
the gloominess and uncertainty of the prospect. They
found from day to day the same steady gales wafting
them with rapidity from their native country, and
indeed from all countries of which they had any
knowledge.</p>
<p ln="[37]">He addressed himself to their passions with all the
<pb n="xxxi">
variety of management that the situation would admit,
sometimes by soothing them with the prognostics of
approaching land, sometimes by flattering their ambition
and feasting their avarice with the glory and
wealth they would acquire from discovering the rich
countries beyond the Atlantic, and sometimes by threatening
them with the displeasure of their king, should
their disobedience defeat so great an object. But
every argument soon lost its effect, and their uneasiness
still increased. From secret whisperings it arose
to open mutiny and dangerous conspiracy. At length
they determined to rid themselves of the remonstrances
of Columbus by throwing him into the sea.
The infection spread from ship to ship, and involved
officers as well as sailors. They finally lost all sense of
subordination, and addressed their commander in an
insolent manner, demanding to be conducted back to
Spain; or, they assured him, they would seek their own
safety by taking away his life.</p>
<p ln="[38]">Columbus, whose sagacity had discerned every symptom
of the disorder, was prepared for this last stage
of it, and was sufficiently apprised of the danger that
awaited him. He found it vain to contend with passions
he could no longer control. He therefore proposed
that they should obey his orders for three days
longer; and, should they not discover land in that
<pb n="xxxii">
time, he would then direct his course for Spain. They
complied with his proposal; and, happily for mankind,
in three days they discovered land. This was a small
island, to which he gave the name of San Salvador.
His first interview with the natives was a scene of
compassion on the one part and astonishment on the
other, but highly interesting to both. The natives
were entirely naked, simple and timorous; and they
viewed the Spaniards as a superior order of beings
descended from the sun; which, in that island and in
most parts of America, was worshipped as a deity. By
this it was easy for Columbus to perceive the line of
conduct proper to be observed towards that simple
and inoffensive people. Had his companions and
successors of the Spanish nation possessed the wisdom
and humanity of this great discoverer, the benevolent
mind would have had to experience no sensations of
regret in contemplating the extensive advantages arising
to mankind from the discovery of America.</p>
<p ln="[39]">In this voyage Columbus discovered the islands of
Cuba and Hispaniola, on the latter of which he erected
a small fort; and having left a garrison of thirty&hyphen;eight
men he set sail for Spain. Returning across the Atlantic,
he was overtaken by a violent storm, which lasted
several days, and increased to such a degree as baffled
his naval skill and threatened immediate destruction.
<pb n="xxxiii">
In this situation, when all were in a state of despair,
and it was expected that every sea would swallow
up the crazy vessel, he manifested a serenity and
presence of mind seldom equalled in cases of like
extremity. He wrote a short account of his voyage
and of the discoveries he had made; this he hastily
wrapped in an oiled cloth, then enclosed it in a cake
of wax and put it into an empty cask, which he threw
overboard, in hopes that some fortunate accident might
preserve a deposit of so much importance to the world.</p>
<p ln="[40]">The storm however abated, and he at length arrived
in Spain, after having been driven by stress of weather
into the port of Lisbon; where he had opportunity,
in an interview with the king of Portugal, to prove
the truth of his system by arguments more convincing
than those he had before advanced in the character of
a bold projector but humble suitor. He was received
every where in Spain with royal honors; his family
was ennobled, and his former stipulation respecting
his offices and emoluments was ratified in the most
solemn manner by Ferdinand and Isabella; while all
Europe resounded his praises, and reciprocated their
joy and congratulations on the discovery of what they
called a new world.</p>
<p ln="[41]">The immediate consequence was a second voyage,
in which Columbus took charge of a squadron of
<pb n="xxxiv">
seventeen ships of considerable burden. Volunteers of
all ranks solicited to be employed in this expedition.
He carried over fifteen hundred persons, with the
necessaries for establishing a colony and extending his
discoveries. In this voyage he explored most of the
West India islands; but on his arrival at Hispaniola he
found that the garrison he had left there had been all
destroyed by the natives, and the fort demolished.
He proceeded, however, in the planting of his colony;
and, by his prudent and humane conduct toward the
natives, he effectually established the Spanish authority
in that island. But while he was thus laying the
foundation of European dominion in America, some
discontented persons, who had returned to Spain,
uniting with his former opponents and powerful enemies
at court, conspired to accomplish his ruin.</p>
<p ln="[42]">They represented his conduct in such a light as to
create uneasiness in the jealous mind of Ferdinand,
and make it necessary for Columbus again to return
to Spain, to counteract their machinations and obtain
such further supplies as were necessary to his great
political and beneficent purposes. On his arriving at
court, and stating with his usual dignity and confidence
the whole history of his transactions abroad, every
thing wore a favorable appearance. He was received
with the same honors as before, and solicited to take
<pb n="xxxv">
charge of another squadron, to carry out supplies, to
pursue his discoveries, and in every respect to use his
discretion in extending the Spanish empire in the new
world.</p>
<p ln="[43]">In this third voyage he discovered the continent
of America at the mouth of the river Orinoco. He
rectified many disorders in his government of Hispaniola,
which had happened in his absence; and every
thing was going on in a prosperous train, when an
event was announced to him, which completed his
own ruin and gave a fatal turn to the Spanish policy
and conduct in America. This was the arrival of
Francis de Bovadilla, with a commission to supersede
Columbus in his government, to arraign him as a criminal,
and pronounce judgment on all his former administration.</p>
<p ln="[44]">It seems that by this time the enemies of Columbus,
despairing to complete his overthrow by groundless
insinuations of maleconduct, had taken the more effectual
method of exciting the jealousy of their sovereigns.
From the promising samples of gold and other valuable
commodities brought from America, they took occasion
to represent to the king and queen that the prodigious
wealth and extent of the countries he had discovered
would soon throw such power into the hands of the
viceroy, that he would trample on the royal authority
<pb n="xxxvi">
and bid defiance to the Spanish power. These arguments
were well calculated for the cold and suspicious
temper of Ferdinand, and they must have had some
effect upon the mind of Isabella. The consequence
was the appointment of Bovadilla, the inveterate enemy
of Columbus, to take the government from his hands.
This first tyrant of the Spanish nation in America
began his administration by ordering Columbus to be
put in chains on board of a ship, and sending him
prisoner to Spain. By relaxing all discipline he introduced
disorder and licentiousness thro the colony.
He subjected the unhappy natives to a most miserable
servitude, and apportioned them out in large numbers
among his adherents. Under this severe treatment
perished in a short time many thousands of those innocent
people.</p>
<p ln="[45]">Columbus was carried in his fetters to the Spanish
court, where the king and queen either feigned or felt
a sufficient regret at the conduct of Bovadilla towards
their illustrious prisoner. He was not only released
from confinement; he was treated with all imaginable
respect. But, altho the king endeavored to expiate
the offence by censuring and recalling Bovadilla, yet
we may judge of his sincerity from his appointing
Nicholas de Ovando, another well known enemy of
Columbus, to succeed in the government; and from
<pb n="xxxvii">
his ever after refusing to reinstate Columbus, or to
fulfil any of the conditions on which the discoveries
had been undertaken.</p>
<p ln="[46]">After two years of solicitation for this or some other
employment, he at length obtained a squadron of four
small vessels to attempt new discoveries. He then set
out, with the enthusiasm of a young adventurer, in
quest of what was always his favorite object, a passage
into the South Sea, by which he might sail to India.
He touched at Hispaniola, where Ovando the governor
refused him admittance on shore, even to take shelter
during a hurricane, the prognostics of which his experience
had taught him to discern. By putting into a
creek he rode out the storm, and then bore away for
the continent. He spent several months, the most
boisterous of the year, in exploring the coast round
the gulf of Mexico, in hopes of finding the intended
navigation to India. At length he was shipwrecked
and driven ashore on the island of Jamaica.</p>
<p ln="[47]">His cup of calamities seemed now to be full. He was
cast upon an island of savages, without provisions,
without a vessel, and thirty leagues from any Spanish
settlement. But the greatest physical misfortunes are
capable of being imbittered by the insults of our fellow
creatures. A few of his companions generously offered,
in two Indian canoes, to attempt a voyage to Hispaniola,
<pb n="xxxviii">
in hopes of obtaining a vessel for the relief of
the unhappy crew. After suffering every extremity of
danger and fatigue, they arrived at the Spanish colony
in ten days. Ovando, excited by personal malice
against Columbus, detained these messengers eight
months, and then despatched a vessel to Jamaica to
spy out the condition of Columbus and his crew, with
positive instructions to the captain not to afford them
any relief. This order was punctually executed. The
captain approached the shore, delivered a letter of
empty compliment from Ovando to the admiral, received
his answer and returned. About four months
afterwards a vessel came to their relief; and Columbus,
worn out with fatigues and broken by misfortunes,
returned for the last time to Spain. Here a new distress
awaited him, which he considered as one of the
greatest of his whole life: this was the death of queen
Isabella, his last and most powerful friend.</p>
<p ln="[48]">He did not suddenly abandon himself to despair.
He called upon the gratitude and justice of the king;
and in terms of dignity demanded the fulfilment of
his former contract. Notwithstanding his age and infirmities,
he even solicited to be further employed in
extending the career of discovery, without a prospect
of any other reward than the pleasure of doing good
to mankind. But Ferdinand, cold, ungrateful and
<pb n="xxxix">
timid, dared not comply with any proposal of this kind,
lest he should increase his own obligations to a man
whose services he thought it dangerous to reward.
He therefore delayed and avoided any decision on these
subjects, in hopes that the declining health of Columbus
would soon rid the court of the remonstrances of a
suitor, whose unexampled merit was, in their opinion,
a sufficient reason for destroying him. In this they
were not disappointed. Columbus languished a short
time, and gladly resigned a life which had been worn
out in the most signal services, perhaps, that have been
rendered by any one man to an ungrateful world.</p>
<p ln="[49]">Posterity is sometimes more just to the memory of
great men than cotemporaries were to their persons.
But even this consolation, if it is one, has been wanting
to the discoverer of our hemisphere. The continent,
instead of bearing his name, has been called after one
of his followers, a man of no particular merit. And
in the modern city of Mexico there is instituted and
perpetuated, by order of government, an annual festival
in honor of Hernando Cortez, the perfidious
butcher of its ancient race; while no public honors
have been decreed to Christopher Columbus, one of
the wisest and best among the benefactors of mankind.</p>
<p ln="[50]">After his last return from America he seems to have
passed the short remainder of his life at Valladolid,
<pb n="xl">
the capital of Old Castile, and then the seat of the
Spanish government. He died in that city on the
twentieth of August 1506, and was buried in one of
its churches. Over his body is a plain stone inscribed
simply with his name, as it is written in Spanish,
<hi r="smcap">Christoval Colon</hi>.</p>
<p ln="[51]">His son, who wrote his life, has left us a particular
description of his person, manners and private character;
all of which were agreeable and interesting. His
portrait is in possession of the author of this poem.
It is painted in oil, half length and the size of life,
copied from an original in the gallery of Florence.</p></prologue>

<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> death of queen Isabella, which happened before the
last return of Columbus from America, was a subject of great
sorrow to him. In her he lost his only powerful friend in
Spain, on whose influence he was accustomed to rely in counteracting
the perpetual intrigues of a host of enemies, whose
rank and fortune gave them a high standing at the court of

<edit>[Footnote: <bytes>2Kb</bytes>]</edit><note idref="AN000002"><p>Atlas and Hesper were of the race of Titans. They were sons
of Uranus or of Japetus, according as the fable is traced to different
countries, whose supreme god (originally the sun) was
called by different names. Atlas, from being king of Mauritania,
became a mountain to support the heavens, and gave his name
to the western ocean. Hesper frequented that mountain in the
study of astronomy; till one evening he disappeared, and returned
no more. He was then placed in the western heaven; and,
having been a beautiful young man, he became a beautiful planet,
called the evening star. This circumstance gave his name to the
western regions of the earth indefinitely. Italy was called
Hesperia by the Greeks, because it lay west from them, and
seemed under the influence of the star of evening; Spain was
called Hesperia by the Romans, for the same reason.</p>
<p>If the nations which adopted this fable had known of a country
west of the Atlantic, that country must have been Hesperia to
them all; and pursuing this analogy I have so named it in
several instances in the course of the poem. Considering Hesper
as the guardian genius, and Columbus as the discoverer of the
western continent, it may derive its name, in poetical language,
from either of theirs indifferently, and be called Hesperia or
Columbia.</p>
<p>Atlas is considered in this poem as the guardian genius of Africa.
See his speech in the eighth book, on the slavery of his people.</p>
<p>This explanation seemed of such immediate importance for understanding the machinery of the poem, as to require its being placed here. The other notes, being numerous and some of them long, are placed at the end of the volume, with suitable reference to the passages to which they belong.</p></note>

<p>This river, from different circumstances, has obtained several
different names. It has been called Amazon, from an idea
that some part of the neighboring country was inhabited by a
race of warlike women, resembling what Herodotus relates of
the Amazons of Scythia. It has been called Orellana, from its
having been discovered by a Spanish officer of that name, who,
on a certain expedition, deserted from the younger Pizarro on
one of the sources of this river and navigated it from thence
to the ocean. Maragnon is the original name given it by the
natives, which name I choose to follow.</p>
<p>If we estimate its magnitude by the length of its course and
the quantity of water it throws into the sea, it is much the
greatest river that has hitherto come to our knowledge. Its
navigation is said by Condamine and others to be uninterrupted
for four thousand miles from the sea. Its breadth within the
banks is sixty geographical miles; it receives in its course a
variety of great rivers, besides those described in the text.
Many of these descend from elevated countries and mountains
covered with snow, the melting of which annually swells the
Maragnon above its banks; when it overflows and fertilizes a
vast extent of territory.</p></note> leads his congregating tides;</l>

<p>Some of the richest diamond mines are found on the banks
of the lake Xaraya. The river Paraguay is remarkable for the
quantities of gold dust found in its channel. The Rio de la
Plata, properly so called, has its source in the mountains of
Potosi; and it was probably from this circumstance that it
received its name, which signifies River of Silver. This river,
after having joined the Paraguay, which is larger than itself,
retains its own name till it reaches the sea. Near the mouth,
it is one hundred and fifty miles wide; but in other respects

to discover a western passage to India. He navigated the Gulf

<p>The color of animals is acquired partly from the food they
eat thro successive generations and partly from the objects
with which they are usually surrounded. Dr. Darwin has a
curious note on this subject, in which he remarks on the advantages
that insects and other small animals derive from their
color, as a means of rendering them invisible to their more powerful
enemies, who thus find it difficult to distinguish them from
other objects where they reside. Some animals which inhabit
cold countries turn white in winter when the earth is covered
with snow, such as the snowbird of the Alps. Others in snowy
regions are habitually white, such as the white bear of Russia.</p></note> roam the lifeless plain,</l>

<caption>ARGUMENT.</caption>
<p>Natives of America appear in vision. Their manners and
characters. Columbus demands the cause of the dissimilarity of
men in different countries. Hesper replies, That the human
body is composed of a due proportion of the elements suited
to the place of its first formation; that these elements, differently
proportioned, produce all the changes of health, sickness, growth
and decay, and may likewise produce any other changes which
occasion the diversity of men; that these elemental proportions
are varied, not more by climate than temperature and other local
circumstances; that the mind is likewise in a state of change,
and will take its physical character from the body and from
external objects: examples. Inquiry concerning the first peopling
of America. View of Mexico. Its destruction by Cortez.
View of Cusco and Quito, cities of Peru. Tradition of Capac
and Oella, founders of the Peruvian empire. Columbus inquires
into their real history. Hesper gives an account of their origin
and relates the stratagems they used in establishing that empire.</p></argument>

<p>Without entering into any discussion on the theory of heat
and cold (a point not yet settled in our academies) I would just
observe, in vindication of the expression in the text, that some
solid matter, such for instance as the surface of the earth, seems
absolutely necessary to the production of heat. At least it must be
a matter more compact than that of the sun's rays; and perhaps
its power of producing heat is in proportion to its solidity.</p>
<p>The warmth communicated to the atmosphere is doubtless
produced by the combined causes of the earth and the sun;
but the agency of the former is probably more powerful in
this operation than that of the latter, and its presence more
indispensable. For masses of matter will produce heat by
friction, without the aid of the sun; but no experiment has
yet proved that the rays of the sun are capable of producing
heat without the aid of other and more solid matter. The air
is temperate in those cavities of the earth where the sun is the
most effectually excluded; whereas the coldest regions yet known
to us are the tops of the Andes, where the sun's rays have the
most direct operation, being the most vertical and the least
obstructed by vapors. Those regions are deprived of heat by
being so far removed from the broad surface of the earth; a
body that appears requisite to warm the surrounding atmosphere
by its cooperation with the action of the sun.</p>
<p>From these principles we may conclude that cultivation, in
a woody country, tends to warm the atmosphere and meliorate
a cold climate; as by removing the forests and marshes it
opens the earth to the sun and allows them to act in conjunction
upon the air.</p>
<p>According to the descriptions given of the middle parts of
Europe by Cesar and Tacitus, it appears that those countries
were much colder in their days than they are at present;
cultivation seems to have softened that climate to a great
degree. The same effect begins to be perceived in North
America. Possibly it may in time become as apparent as the
present difference in the temperature of the two continents.</p></note> the genial skies,</l>

<caption>No. 13.</caption>
<p>We may reckon three stages of improvement in the graphic
art or the art of communicating our thoughts to absent persons
and to posterity by visible signs. First, the invention of
<hi r="italic">painting ideas</hi> or representing actions, dates and other circumstances
of historical fact, by the images of material things,
drawn usually on a flat surface or sometimes carved or molded
in a more solid form. This was the state at which the art
had arrived in Egypt before the introduction of letters, and in
Mexico before the arrival of the Spaniards. The Greeks in
Egypt called it hieroglyphic.</p>
<p>Second, The invention of <hi r="italic">painting sounds</hi>, which we do by
the use of letters or the alphabet, and which we call writing.
This was a vast improvement; as it simplified in a wonderful
degree the communication of thought. For ideas are infinite
in number and variety; while the simple sounds we use to
convey them to the ear are few, distinct and easy to be understood.
It would indeed be impossible to express all our
ideas by distinct and visible images. And even if the writer
were able to do this, not many readers could be made to
understand him; since it would be necessary that every new
idea should have a new image invented and agreed upon between
the writer and the reader, before it could be used: which preliminary
could not be settled without the writer should see and
converse with the reader. And he might as well in this case
convey his ideas by oral speech; so that his writing could be
of little use beyond a certain routine of established signs.</p>
<p>The number of simple sounds in human language used in
discourse is not above eighteen or twenty; and these are so
varied in the succession in which they are uttered, as to
express an inconceivable and endless variety of thought and
sentiment. Then, by the help of an alphabet of about twenty&hyphen;six
letters or visible signs, these sounds are translated from the
ear to the eye; and we are able, by thus painting the sound,
to arrest its fleeting nature, render it permanent and talk with
distant nations and future ages, without any previous convention
whatever, even supposing them to be ignorant of the
language in which we write. This is the present state of the
art, as commonly practised in all the countries where an
alphabet is used. It is called the art of writing, and to understand
it is called reading.</p>
<p>Third, Another invention, which is still in its infancy, is
the art of <hi r="italic">painting phrases</hi>, or sentences, commonly called
short&hyphen;hand writing. This is yet but little used and only by a
few dexterous persons who make it a particular study. Probably
the true principles on which it ought to be founded
are yet to be discovered. But it may be presumed, that in
this part of the graphic art there remains to the ingenuity of
future generations a course of improvements totally inconceivable
to the present; by which the whole train of impressions
now made upon the mind by reading a long and well written
treatise may be conveyed by a few strokes of the pen and be
received at a glance of the eye. This desideratum would be
an abridgment of labor in our mental acquisitions, of which
we cannot determine the consequences. It might make, in the
progress of human knowledge, an epoch as remarkable as that
which was made by the invention of alphabetical writing, and
produce as great a change in the mode of transmitting the
history of events.</p>
<p>One consequence of the invention of alphabetical writing
seems to have been to throw into oblivion all previous historical
facts; and it has thus left an immense void, which the
imagination knows not how to fill, in contemplating the progress
of our race. How many important discoveries, which
still remain to our use, must have taken their origin in that
space of time which is thus left a void to us! A vast succession
of ages and ages of improvement must have preceded
(for example) the invention of the wheel. The wheel must
have been in common use, we know not how long, before
alphabetical writing; because we find its image employed in
painting ideas, during the first stage of the graphic art above
described. The wheel was likewise in use before the mysteries
of Ceres or those of Isis were established, as is evident from
its being imagined as an instrument of punishment in hell, in
the case of Ixion, as represented in those mysteries. The
taming of the ox and horse, the use of the sickle and the bow
and arrow, a considerable knowledge of astronomy and its
application to the purposes of agriculture and navigation, with
many other circumstances which show a prodigious improvement,
must evidently have preceded the date of the zodiac;
a date fixed by Dupuis, with a great degree of probability, at
about seventeen thousand years from our time. This epoch
would doubtless carry us back many thousand years beyond
that of the alphabet; the invention of which was sufficient of
itself to obliterate the details of previous history, as the event
has proved.</p>
<p>How far the loss of these historical details is to be regretted,
as an impediment to our progress in useful knowledge, I will
not decide; but in one view, which I am going to state, it may
be justly considered as a misfortune.</p>
<p>The art of painting ideas, being arrested in the state in
which the use of the alphabet found it, went into general
disuse for common purposes; and the works then extant, as
well as, the knowledge of writing in that mode, being no
longer intelligible to the people, became objects of deep and
laborious study and known only to the learned; that is, the
men of leisure and contemplation. These men consequently
ran it into mystery; making it a holy object, above the reach
of vulgar inquiry. On this ground they established, in the
course of ages, profitable function or profession, in the practice
of which a certain portion of men of the brightest talents
could make a reputable living; taking care not to initiate
more than a limited number of professors, no more than the
people could maintain as priests This mode of writing then
assumed the name of hieroglyphic, or <hi r="italic">sacred painting</hi>, to distinguish
it from that which had now become the vulgar mode
of writing, by the use of the alphabet. This is perhaps the
source of that ancient, vast and variegated system of false
religion, with all its host of errors and miseries, which has so
long and so grievously weighed upon the character of human
nature.</p>
<p>In noticing the distinction of the three stages in the graphic
art above described, I have not mentioned the wonderful
powers we derive from it in the language of the mathematics
and the language of music. In each of these, tho its effects
are already astonishing, there is no doubt but great improvements
are still to be made. Our present mode of writing in
these, as in literature, belongs to the <hi r="italic">second</hi> or <hi r="italic">alphabetical</hi>
stage of the graphic art. The ten ciphers and the other signs
used in the mathematical sciences form the alphabet in which
the language of those sciences is written. The few musical
notes and the other signs which accompany them furnish an
alphabet for writing the language of music.</p>
<p>The mode of writing in China is still different from any of
those I have mentioned. The Chinese neither paint ideas nor
sounds; but they make a character for every word; which
character must vary according to the different inflections and
uses of that word. The characters must therefore be insupportably
numerous and be still increasing as the language is
enriched with new words by the augmentation and correction
of ideas.</p>
<p>The English language is supposed to contain about twelve
thousand distinct words and the Italian about seventeen thousand,
in the present state of our sciences. I know not how
many the Chinese may contain; but if we were to write our
languages in the Chinese method, it would be the business of
a whole life for a man to learn his mother tongue, so as to read
and write it for his ordinary purposes.</p>
<p>As the Chinese have not adopted an alphabet, but have
adhered to an invariable state of the graphic art, which is probably
more ancient by several thousand years than our present
method, may we not venture to conjecture that the traces of
their very ancient history have been, for that reason, better
preserved? and that their pretensions to a very high antiquity,
which we have been used to think extravagant and ridiculous,
are really not without foundation? If so, we might then
allow a little more latitude to ourselves, and conclude that we
are in fact as old as they and might have been as sensible of
it, if we had adhered to our ancient method of writing; and
not changed it for a new one which, while it has facilitated
the progress of our science, has humbled our pride of antiquity,
by obliterating the dates of those labors and improvements
of our early progenitors, to which we are indebted for
more of the rudiments of our sciences and our arts than we
usually imagine.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted, that the Spanish devastation in
Mexico and Peru was so universal as to leave us but few
monuments of the history of the human mind in those countries,
which presented a state of manners so remarkably different
from what can be found in any other part of the world. The
pictorial writing of the Mexicans, tho sometimes called hieroglyphic,
does not appear to merit that name, as it was not
exclusively appropriated by the priests to sacred purposes.
Indeed it could not be so appropriated till a more convenient
method could be discovered and adopted for common purposes.
For a thing cannot become sacred, in this sense of the word,
until it ceases to be common.</p></note> to stretch the span</l>

Mexico, was as remarkable for that hardy spirit of adventure,
to which success gives the name of policy, as his subsequent
operations were for cruelty and perfidy. As soon as his army
was on shore, he dismantled his fleet of such articles as would
be useful in building a new one; he then set fire to his ships
and burnt them in presence of his men, that they might fight
their battles with more desperate courage, knowing that it
would be impossible to save themselves from a victorious enemy
by flight. He constructed a fort, in which the iron and the

<p>It is worthy of remark, that the countries where the worship
of the sun has made the greatest figure are Egypt and Peru;
the two regions of the earth the most habitually deprived of
rain and probably of clouds, which in other countries so frequently
obstruct his rays and seem to dispute his influence.
Tho in the rude ages of society it is certainly natural in all
countries to pay adoration to the sun, as one of the visible
agents of those changes in the atmosphere which most affect
the people's happiness, yet it is reasonable to suppose that this
adoration would be more unmixed and consequently more
durable, in climates where the agency of the sun appears
unrivalled and supreme.</p>
<p>On the supposition that Greece and Western Asia, regions
whose early traditions are best known to us, derived their
first theological ideas from Egypt, it is curious to observe how
the pure heliosebia of Egypt degenerated in those climates in
proportion as other visible agents seemed to exert their influence
in human affairs. Greece is a mountainous country, subject
to a great deal of lightning and other meteors, whose effects
are tremendous and make stronger impressions on rude savages
than the gentle energies of the sun.</p>
<p>The Greeks therefore, having forgotten the source of their
religious system, ceased to consider the sun as their supreme
god; his agency being in their opinion subject to a more
potent divinity, the Power of the air or Jupiter, whom they
styled the Thunderer. So that Apollo, the god of light,
became in their mythology the subject and offspring of the
supreme god of the atmosphere. This religion became extremely
confused and complicated with new fables, according
to the temperature and other accidents of the different climates
thro which it passed. The god of thunder obtained
the supreme veneration generally in Europe; known in the
south by the name of Jupiter or Zeus and in the north by
that of Thor.</p>
<p>Europe in general has an uneven surface and a vapory sky,
liable to great concussions in the lower regions of the atmosphere
which border the habitation of man. There is no
wonder that in such a region the god of the air should appear
more powerful than the god of light. This disposition of the
elements has given a gloomy cast to the mind, and in the north
more than in the south. The Thor of the Celtic nations was
more tremendous, more feared and less beloved, than the
Jupiter of the Greeks and Romans; he was worshipped accordingly
with more bloody sacrifices. But in all Europe,
western Asia and the northwestern coast of Africa, where the
earth is uneven and the climate variable, their religion was
more gloomy and their gods more ferocious than among the
ancient Egyptians.</p>
<p>A like difference is observed in the religions of the two
countries in America where civilization was most advanced
before the arrival of the Spaniards. Peru enjoyed a climate
of great serenity and regularity. Of all the sensible agents
that operated on the earth and air, the sun was apparently
the most uniform and energetic. The worship of the sun was
therefore the most predominant and durable; and it inspired
a mildness of manners analogous to his mild and beneficent
influence. In Mexico and other uneven countries where storms
and earthquakes were frequent, the sun, altho he was reckoned
among their deities, was not considered so powerful as those
of a more boisterous and maleficent nature. The Mexican
worship was therefore addressed chiefly to ferocious beings,
enemies to human happiness, who delighted in the tears and
blood of their votaries. The difference in the moral cast of
religion in Peru and Mexico, as well as in Egypt and Greece,
must have been greatly owing to climate. Indeed in what else
should it be found, since the origin of religious ideas must have
been in the energies of those visible agents which form the
distinctive character of climates?</p></note> that gives the changing day.</l></pdiv>

<p>The traditions respecting these founders of the Peruvian
empire are indeed obscure; but they excite in us the same sort
of veneration that we feel for the most amiable and distinguished
characters of remote antiquity. The honest zeal of Garcilasso
de la Vega in collecting these traditions into one body of history,
as a probable series of facts, is to be applauded; since he
has there presented us with one of the most striking examples
of the <hi r="italic">beau ideal</hi> in political character, that can be found in
the whole range of literature. He treats his subject with more
natural simplicity, tho with less talent, than Plutarch or Xenophon,
when they undertake a similar task, that of drawing
traditional characters to fill up the middle space between fable
and history.</p>
<p>With regard to the true position that the portrait of Manco
Capac ought to hold in this middle space, how near it should
stand to history and how near to fable, we should find it
difficult to say and perhaps useless to inquire. Plutarch has
gravely given us the lives and actions of several heroes who
are evidently more fabulous than Capac, and of others who
should be placed on the same line with him. The existence of
Theseus, Romulus and Numa is more doubtful and their actions
less probable than his. The character of Capac, in regard to
its reality, stands on a parallel with that of the Lycurgus of
Plutarch and the Cyrus of Xenophon; not purely historical nor
purely fabulous, but presented to us as a compendium of those
talents and labors which might possibly be crowded into the
capacity of one mind and be achieved in one life, but which
more probably belong to several generations; the talents and
labors that could reduce a great number of ferocious tribes into
one peaceable and industrious state.</p>
<p>Garcilasso was himself an Inca by maternal descent, born
and educated at Cusco after the Spanish conquest. He writes
apparently with the most scrupulous regard to truth, with little
judgment and no ornament. He discovers a credulous zeal to
throw a lustre on his remote ancestor Manco Capac, not by
inventing new incidents, but by collecting with great industry
all that had been recorded in the annals of the family. And
their manner of recording events, tho not so perfect as that
of writing, was not so liable to error as traditions merely
oral, like those of the Caledonian and other Celtic bards, with
respect to the ancient heroes of their countries.</p>
<p>His account states, that about four centuries previous to the
discovery of that country by the Spaniards, the natives of Peru
were as rude savages as any in America. They had no fixed
habitations, no ideas of permanent property; they wandered
naked like the beasts and like them depended on the events of
each day for a subsistence. At this period Manco Capac and
his wife Mama Oella appeared on a small island in the lake
Titiaca, near which the city of Cusco was afterwards built.
These persons, to establish a belief of their divinity in the minds
of the people, were clothed in white garments of cotton and
declared themselves descended from the sun, who was their
father and the god of that country. They affirmed that he
was offended at their cruel and perpetual wars, their barbarous
modes of worship and their neglecting to make the best use of
the blessings he was constantly bestowing, in fertilizing the earth
and producing vegetation; that he pitied their wretched state
and had sent his own children to instruct them and to establish
a number of wise regulations, by which they might be rendered
happy.</p>
<p>By some uncommon method of persuasion, these persons drew
together a few of the savage tribes, laid the foundation of the
city of Cusco and established what is called the kingdom of the
Sun, or the Peruvian empire. In the reign of Manco Capac,
the dominion was extended about eight leagues from the city;
and at the end of four centuries it was established fifteen hundred
miles on the coast of the Pacific ocean, and from that
ocean to the Andes. During this period, thro a succession of
twelve monarchs, the original constitution, etablished by the
first Inca, remained unaltered; and this constitution, with the
empire itself, was at last overtuned by an accident which no
human wisdom could foresee or prevent.</p>
<p>For a more particular detail of the character and institutions
of this extraordinary personage, the reader is referred to
a subsequent note, in which he will find a dissertation on that
subject.</p>
<p>In the passage preceding this reference, I have alluded to
the fabulous traditions relating to these children of the sun.
In the remainder of the second and thro the whole of the
third book, I have given what may be supposed a probable
narrative of their real origin and actions. The space allowed
to this episode may appear too considerable in a poem whose
principal object is so different. But it may be useful to exhibit
in action the manners and sentiments of savage tribes, whose
aliment is war; that the contrast may show more forcibly the
advantages of civilized life, whose aliment is peace.</p></note> in flowery fiction drest,</l>

<caption>DISSERTATION ON THE INSTITUTIONS OF MANCO CAPAC. For the end of Book II.</caption>
<p>Altho the original inhabitants of America in general deserve
to be classed among the most unimproved savages that had
been discovered before those of New Holland, yet the Mexican
and Peruvian governments exhibited remarkable exceptions, and
seemed to be fast approaching to a state of civilization. In
the difference of national character between the people of these
two empires we may discern the influence of political systems
on the human mind, and infer the importance of the task which
a legislator undertakes, in attempting to reduce a barbarous
people under the control of government and laws.</p>
<p>The Mexican constitution was formed to render its subjects
brave and powerful; but, while it succeeded in this object, it
kept them far removed from the real blessings of society.
According to the Spanish accounts (which for an obvious reason
may however be suspected of exaggeration) the manners of the
Mexicans were uncommonly ferocious, and their religion gloomy,
sanguinary and unrelenting. But the establishments of Manco
Capac, if we may follow Garcilasso in attributing the whole of
the Peruvian constitution to that wonderful personage, present
the aspect of a most benevolent and pacific system; they tended
to humanize the world and render his people happy; while his
ideas of deity were so elevated as to bear a comparison with
the sublime doctrines of Socrates or Plato.</p>
<p>The characters, whether real or fabulous, who are the most
distinguished as lawgivers among barbarous nations, are Moses,
Lycurgus, Solon, Numa, Mahomet, and Peter of Russia. Of
these, only the two former and the two latter appear really
to deserve the character of lawgivers. Solon and Numa possessed
not the opportunity of showing their talents in the work
of original legislation. Athens and Rome were considerably
civilized before these persons arose. The most they could do
was to correct and amend constitutions already formed. Solon
may be considered as a wise politician, but by no means as the
founder of a nation. The Athenians were too far advanced in
society to admit any radical change in their form of government;
unless recourse could have been had to the representative
system, by establishing an equality of rank and instructing all
the people in their duties and their rights; a system which was
never understood by any ancient legislator.</p>
<p>The institutions of Numa (if such a person as Numa really
existed) were more effective and durable. His religious ceremonies
were for many ages the most powerful check on the
licentious and turbulent Romans; the greater part of whom
were ignorant slaves. By inculcating a remarkable reverence
for the gods and making it necessary to consult the auspices
when any thing important was to be transacted, his object was
to render the popular superstition subservient to the views of
policy and thus to give the senate a steady check upon the
plebeians. But the constitutions of Rome and Athens, notwithstanding
the abundant applause that has been bestowed upon
them, were never fixed on any permanent principles; tho the
wisdom of some of their rulers and the spirit of liberty that
inspired the citizens may justly demand our admiration.</p>
<p>Each of the other legislators above mentioned deserves a
particular consideration, as having acted in stations somewhat
similar to that of the Peruvian patriarch. Three objects are
to be attended to by the legislator of a barbarous people: First,
That his system be such as is capable of reducing the greatest
number of men under one jurisdiction: Second, That it apply
to such principles in human nature for its support as are universal
and permanent, in order to insure the duration of the
government: Third, That it admit of improvements correspondent
to any advancement in knowledge or variation of
circumstances that may happen to its subjects, without endangering
the principle of government by such innovations. So far
as the systems of such legislators agree with these fundamental
principles, they are worthy of respect; and so far as they deviate, they may be considered as defective.</p>
<p>To begin with Moses and Lycurgus: it is proper to observe
that in order to judge of the merit of any institutions, we must
take into view the peculiar character of the people for whom
they were framed. For want of this attention, many of the
laws of Moses and some of those of Lycurgus have been ridiculed
and censured. The Jews, when led by Moses out of
Egypt, were not only uncivilized, but having just risen to independence
from a state of servitude they united the manners
of servants and savages, and their national character was a
compound of servility, ignorance, filthiness and cruelty. Of
their cruelty as a people we need no other proof than the
account of their avengers of blood and the readiness with which
the whole congregation turned executioners and stoned to death
the devoted offenders. The leprosy, a disease now scarcely
known, was undoubtedly produced by a want of cleanliness,
continued for successive generations. In this view their frequent
ablutions, their peculiar modes of trial and several other
institutions may be vindicated from ridicule and proved to be
wise regulations.</p>
<p>The Spartan lawgiver has been censured for the toleration of
theft and adultery. Among that race of barbarians these habits
were too general to admit of total prevention or universal
punishment. By vesting all property in the commonwealth,
instead of encouraging theft be removed the possibility of the
crime; and, in a nation where licentiousness was generally
indulged, it was a great step towards introducing a purity of
manners, to punish adultery in all cases wherein it was committed
without the consent of all parties interested in its consequences.</p>
<p>Until the institution of representative republics, which are
of recent date, it was found that those constitutions of government
were best calculated for immediate energy and duration,
which were interwoven with some religious system. The legislator
who appears in the character of an inspired person renders
his political institutions sacred and interests the conscience as
well as the judgment in their support. The Jewish lawgiver
had this advantage over the Spartan: he appeared not in the
character of a mere earthly governor, but as an interpreter of
the divine will. By enjoining a religious observance of certain
rites he formed his people to habitual obedience; by directing
their cruelty against the breakers of the laws he at least mitigated
the rancor of private hatred; by directing that real
property should return to the original families in the year of
Jubilee he prevented too great an inequality of wealth; and by
selecting a single tribe to be the interpreters of religion he
prevented its mysteries from being the subject of profane and
vulgar investigation. With a view of securing the permanence
of his institutions, he prohibited intercourse with foreigners
by severe restrictions and formed his people to habits and a
character disagreeable to other nations; so that any foreign
intercourse was prevented by the mutual hatred of both parties.</p>
<p>To these institutions the laws of Lycurgus bear a striking resemblance.
The features of his constitution were severe and
forbidding; it was however calculated to inspire the most enthusiastic
love of liberty and martial honor. In no country was
the patriotic passion more energetic than in Sparta; no laws ever
excluded the idea of separate property in an equal degree or
inspired a greater contempt for the manners of other nations.
The prohibition of money, commerce and almost every thing
desirable to effeminate nations, excluded foreigners from Sparta;
and while it inspired the people with contempt for strangers
it made them agreeable to each other. By these means Lycurgus
rendered the nation warlike; and to insure the duration of the
government he endeavored to interest the consciences of his
people by the aid of oracles and by the oath he is said to have
exacted from them to obey his laws till his return, when he
went into perpetual exile.</p>
<p>From this view of the Jewish and Spartan institutions, applied
to the principles before stated, they appear in the two first articles
considerably imperfect, and in the last totally defective. Neither
of them was calculated to bring any considerable territory
or number of men under one jurisdiction; from this circumstance
alone they could not be rendered permanent, as nations so restricted
in their means of extension must be constantly exposed
to their more powerful neighbors. But the third object of legislation,
that of providing for the future progress of society, which
as it regards the happiness of mankind is the most important of
the three, was in both instances entirely neglected. These systems
appear to have been formed with an express design to prevent
future improvement in knowledge or enlargement of the human
mind, and to fix those nations in a state of ignorance and barbarism.
To vindicate their authors from an imputation of weakness
or inattention in this particular, it may be urged that they were
each of them surrounded by nations more powerful than their
own; it was therefore perhaps impossible for them to commence
an establishment upon any other plan.</p>
<p>The institutions of Mahomet are next to be considered. The
first object of legislation appears to have been better understood
by him than by either of the preceding sages; his jurisdiction was
capable of being enlarged to any extent of territory, and governing
any number of nations that might be subjugated by his
enthusiastic armies; and his system of religion was admirably
calculated to attain this object. Like Moses, he convinced his
people that he acted as the vicegerent of God; but with this
advantage, adapting his religion to the natural feelings and propensities
of mankind, he multiplied his followers by the allurements
of pleasure and the promise of a sensual paradise. These
circumstances were likewise sure to render his constitution durable.
His religious system was so easy to be understood, so
splendid and so inviting, there could be no danger that the
people would lose sight of its principles, and no necessity of
future prophets to explain its doctrines or reform the nation.
To these advantages if we add the exact and rigid military discipline,
the splendor and sacredness of the monarch and that total
ignorance among the people which such a system will produce
and perpetuate, the establishment must have been evidently calculated
for a considerable extent and duration. But the last and
most important end of government, that of mental improvement
and social happiness, was deplorably lost in the institution.
There was probably more learning and cultivated genius in
Arabia in the days of this extraordinary man than can now be
found in all the Mahometan dominions.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the enterprising mind of the Russian monarch
appears to have been wholly bent on the arts of civilization and
the improvement of society among his subjects. Established in
a legal title to a throne, which already commanded a prodigious
extent of country, he found the first object of government
already secured; and by applying himself with great sagacity
to the third object, that of improving his people, it was reasonable
to suppose that the second, the durability of his system,
would become a necessary consequence. He effected his purposes,
important as they were, merely by the introduction of the arts
and the encouragement of politer manners. The greatness of
his character appears not so much in his institutions, which he
copied from other nations, as in the extraordinary measures he
followed to introduce them, the judgment he showed in selecting
and adapting them to the genius of his subjects and the
surprising assiduity by which he raised a savage people to an
elevated rank among European nations.</p>
<p>To the nature and operation of the several forms of government
above mentioned I will compare that of the Peruvian lawgiver.
I have observed in a preceding note that the knowledge we have
of Manco Capac is necessarily imperfect and obscure, derived
thro traditions and family registers (without the aid of writing)
for four hundred years: from the time he is supposed to have
lived, till that of his historian and descendant, Inca Garcilasso
de la Vega. About an equal interval elapsed from the supposed
epoch of the first kings of Rome to that of their first historians;
a longer space from Lycurgus to Herodotus; probably not a
shorter one from the time of the great Cyrus to that of Xenophon,
author of the elegant romance on the actions of that hero.</p>
<p>I recal the reader's attention to these comparisons, not with a
view of contending that our accounts of the actions ascribed to
Capac are derived from authentic records, and that he is a subject
of real history, like Mahomet or Peter; but to show that our
channels of information with regard to him being equally respectable
with those that have brought us acquainted with the
classical and venerable names of Lycurgus, Romulus, Numa and
Cyrus, we may be as correct in our reasonings from the modern
as from the ancient source of reference, and fancy ourselves
treading a ground as sacred on the tomb of the western patriarch,
as on those more frequented and less scrutinized in the east,
consecrated to the demigods of Sparta, Rome and Persia.</p>
<p>It is probable that the savages of Peru before the time of
Capac, among other objects of adoration, paid homage to the
sun. By availing himself of this popular sentiment he appeared,
like Moses and Mahomet, in the character of a divine legislator
endowed with supernatural powers. After impressing these
ideas on the minds of the people, drawing together a number
of the tribes and rendering them subservient to his benevolent
purposes, he applied himself to forming the outlines of a plan
of policy, capable of founding and regulating an extensive empire,
wisely calculated for long duration and well adapted to
improve the knowledge, peace and happiness of a considerable
portion of mankind. In the allotment of the lands as private
property he invented a mode somewhat resembling the feudal
system of Europe: yet this system was checked in its operation
by a law similar to that of Moses which regulated landed possessions
in the year of Jubilee. He divided the lands into three
parts: the first was consecrated to the uses of religion; as it was
from the sacerdotal part of his system that he doubtless expected
its most powerful support. The second portion was set apart
for the Inca and his family, to enable him to defray the expenses
of government and appear in the style of a monarch. The third
and largest portion was allotted to the people; which allotment
was repeated every year and varied according to the number
and exigences of each family.</p>
<p>As the Incan race appeared in the character of divinities, it
seemed necessary that a subordination of rank should be established,
to render the distinction between the monarch and his
people more perceptible. With this view he created a band of
nobles who were distinguished by personal and hereditary honors.
These were united to the monarch by the strongest ties of interest:
in peace they acted as judges and superintended the police of the
empire; in war they commanded in the armies. The next order
of men were the respectable landholders and cultivators, who
composed the principal strength of the nation. Below these
was a class of men who were the servants of the public and
cultivated the public lands. They possessed no property; and
their security depended on their regular industry and peaceable
demeanor. Above all these orders were the Inca and his family.
He possessed absolute and uncontrolable power. His mandates
were regarded as the word of heaven; and the double guilt of
impiety and rebellion attended on disobedience.</p>
<p>To impress the utmost veneration for the Incan family it
was a fundamental principle that the royal blood should never
be contaminated by any foreign alliance. The mysteries of
religion were preserved sacred by the high priest of the royal
family under the control of the king, and celebrated with rites
capable of making the deepest impression on the multitude.
The annual distribution of the lands, while it provided for the
varying circumstances of each family, was designed to strengthen
the bands of society by perpetuating that distinction of rank
among the orders which is supposed necessary to a monarchical
government: the peasants could not vie with their superiors,
and the nobles could not be subjected by misfortune to a subordinate
station. A constant habit of industry was inculcated
upon all ranks by the force of example. The cultivation of
the soil, which in most other countries is considered as one of
the lowest employments, was here regarded as a divine art.
Having had no knowledge of it before and being taught it by the
children of their god, the people viewed it as a sacred privilege,
a national honor, to assist the sun in opening the bosom of the
earth to produce vegetation. That the government might be
able to exercise the endearing acts of beneficence, the produce
of the public lands was reserved in magazines to supply the wants
of the unfortunate and as a resource in case of scarcity or invasion.</p>
<p>These are the outlines of a government the most simple and
energetic, and at least as capable as any monarchy within our
knowledge of reducing great and populous countries under one
jurisdiction; at the same time, accommodating its principle to every
stage of improvement, by a singular and happy application to
the passions of the human mind, it encouraged the advancement
of knowledge without being endangered by success.</p>
<p>In the traits of character which distinguish this institution
we may discern all the great principles of each of the legislators
above mentioned. The pretensions of Capac to divine authority
were as artfully contrived and as effectual in their consequences
as those of Mahomet; his exploding the worship of evil beings
and objects of terror, forbidding human sacrifices and accommodating
the rites of worship to a god of justice and benevolence,
produced a greater change in the national character of his people
than the laws of Moses did in his; like Peter he provided for the
future improvement of society, while his actions were never
measured on the contracted scale which limited the genius of
Lycurgus.</p>
<p>Thus far we find that altho the political system of Capac did
not embrace that extensive scope of human nature which is necessary
in forming republican institutions, and which can be
drawn only from long and well recorded experience of the
passions and tendencies of social man, yet it must be pronounced
at least equal to those of the most celebrated monarchical lawgivers,
whether ancient or modern. But in some things his
mind seems to have attained an elevation with which few of theirs
will bear a comparison: I mean in his religious institutions and
the exalted ideas he had formed of the agency and attributes of
supernatural beings.</p>
<p>From what source he could have drawn these ideas it is
difficult to form a satisfactory conjecture. The worship of the
sun is so natural to an early state of society, in a mild climate
with a clear atmosphere, that it may be as reasonable to suppose
it would originate in Peru as in Egypt or Persia; where we
find that a similar worship did originate and was wrought into a
splendid system; whence it was probably extended, with various
modifications, over most of the ancient world.</p>
<p>Or if we reject this theory and suppose that only one nation,
from some circumstance peculiar to itself, could create the materials
of such a system, and has consequently had the privilege
of giving its religion to the human race, we may in this case
imagine that the Phenicians (who colonized Cadiz and other
places in the west of Europe at the time when they possessed
the solar worship in all its glory) must have had a vessel driven
across the Atlantic, and thus conveyed a stock of inhabitants
with their own religious ideas to the western continent.</p>
<p>The first theory is doubtless the most plausible. And the
mild regions of Peru, for the reasons mentioned in a former note,
became like Egypt the seat of an institution so congenial to its
climate. But in more boisterous climates, where storms and
other violent agents prevail, many different fables have wrought
themselves into the system, as remarked in the same note; and
the solar religion in such countries has generally lost its name
and the more beneficent parts of its influence. Being thus corrupted,
religion in almost every part of the earth assumed a
gloomy and sanguinary character.</p>
<p>Savage nations create their gods from such materials as they
have at hand, the most striking to their senses. And these are
in general an assemblage of destructive attributes. They usually
form no idea of a general superintending providence: they consider
not their god as the author of their beings, the creator of
the world and the dispenser of the happiness they enjoy. They
discern him not in the usual course of nature, in the sunshine
and in the shower, the productions of the earth and the
blessings of society. They find a deity only in the storm, the
earthquake and the whirlwind; or ascribe to him the evils of
pestilence and famine. They consider him as interposing in
wrath to change the course of nature and exercise the attributes
of rage and revenge. They adore him with rites suited to these
attributes, with horror, with penance and with sacrifice. They
imagine him pleased with the severity of their mortifications,
with the oblations of blood and the cries of human victims; and
they hope to compound for greater judgments by voluntary sufferings
and horrid sacrifices, suited to the relish of his taste.</p>
<p>Perhaps no single criterion can be given which will determine
more accurately the state of society in any age or nation than
their general ideas concerning the nature and attributes of deity.
In the most enlightened periods of antiquity, only a few of their
philosophers, a Socrates, Tully or Confucius, ever formed a rational
idea on the subject, or described a god of purity, justice
and benevolence. But Capac, erecting his institutions in a country
where the visible agents of nature inspired more satisfactory feelings,
adopted a milder system. As the sun with its undisturbed
influence seemed to point itself out as the supreme controller and
vital principle of nature, he formed the idea, as the Egyptians
had done before, of constituting that luminary the chief object of
adoration. He taught the nation to consider the sun as the parent
of the universe, the god of order and regularity; ascribing to his
influence the rotation of the seasons, the productions of the earth
and the blessings of health; especially attributing to his inspiration
the wisdom of their laws and that happy constitution which was
the delight and veneration of the people.</p>
<p>A system so just and benevolent, as might be expected, was
attended with success. In about four centuries the dominion of the
Incas had extended fifteen hundred miles in length and had introduced
peace and prosperity thro the whole region. The arts of
society had been carried to a considerable degree of improvement
and the authority of the Incan race universally acknowledged,
when an event happened which disturbed the tranquillity of the
empire. Huana Capac, the twelfth monarch, had reduced the
powerful kingdom of Quito and annexed it to his dominions. To
conciliate the affections of his new subjects, he married a daughter
of the ancient king of Quito, who was not of the race of the Incas.
Thus, by violating a fundamental law of the empire, he left at his
death a disputed succession to the throne. Atabalipa, the son of
Huana by the heiress of Quito, being in possession of the principal
force of the Peruvian armies left at that place on the death of his
father, gave battle to his brother Huascar, who was the elder son
of Huana by a lawful wife, and legal heir to the crown.</p>
<p>After a long and destructive civil war the former was victorious,
and thus was that flourishing kingdom left a prey to regal dissensions
and to the few soldiers of Pizarro, who happened at that
juncture to make a descent upon the coast. In this manner he
effected an easy conquest and an utter destruction of a numerous, brave, unfortunate people.</p>
<p>It is however obvious that this deplorable event is not to be
charged on Capac, as the consequence of any defect in his institution.
It is impossible that an original legislator should effectually
guard against the folly of all future sovereigns. Capac had
not only removed every temptation that could induce a wise
prince to wish for a change in the constitution, but had connected
the ruin of his authority with the change; for he who
disregards any part of institutions deemed sacred, teaches his
people to consider the whole as an imposture. Had he made a
law ordaining that the Peruvians should be absolved from their
allegiance to a prince who should violate the laws, it would have
implied possible error and imperfection in those persons whom
the people were ordered to regard as divinities. The reverence due
to characters who made such high pretensions would have been
weakened; and instead of rendering the constitution perfect, such
a law would have been its greatest defect. Besides, it is probable
the rupture might have been healed and the succession settled,
with as little difficulty as frequently happens with partial revolutions
in other kingdoms, had not the descent of the Spaniards
prevented it. And this event, for that age and country, must
have been beyond the possibility of human foresight. But viewing
the concurrence of these fatal accidents, which reduced this flourishing
empire to a level with many other ruined and departed
kingdoms, it only furnishes an additional proof that no political
system has yet had the privilege to be perfect.</p>
<p>On the whole it is evident that the system of Capac (if the
Peruvian constitution may be so called) is one of the greatest
exertions of genius to be found in the history of mankind. When
we consider him as an individual emerging from the midst of a
barbarous people, having seen no example of the operation of laws
in any country, originating a plan of religion and policy never
equalled by the sages of antiquity, civilizing an extensive empire
and rendering religion and government subservient to the general
happiness of a great people, there is no danger that we grow too
warm in his praise or pronounce too high an eulogium on his
character.</p></note> of the Sun.</l></pdiv></div3>

<caption>No. 22.</caption>
<p>The lautu was a cotton band, twisted and worn on the head of
the Incas as a badge of royalty. It made several turns round the
head; and, according to the description of Garcilasso, it must
have resembled the Turkish turban.</p>
<p>It is possible that both the lautu and the turban had their
remote origin in the ancient astronomical religion, whose principal
god was the sun and usually represented under the figure
of a man with the horns of the ram; that is, the sun in the sign
of aries. The form of the lautu and of the turban (which I
suppose to be the same) seems to indicate that they were originally
designed as emblems or badges; and when properly twisted
and wound round the head, as Turks of distinction usually wear
the turban, they resemble the horns of the ram as represented
in those figures of Jupiter Ammon where the horns curl close
to the head.</p>
<p>There is an engraving in Garcilasso representing the first Inca
and his wife, Capac and Oella; and the heads of both are ornamented
with rams' horns projecting out from the lautu. Whether
the figures of these personages were usually so represented
in Peru previous to the Spanish devastation, would be difficult
at this day to ascertain. If it could be ascertained that they were
usually so represented there, we might esteem it a remarkable
circumstance in proof of the unity of the origin of their religion
with that of the ancient Egyptians; from which all the early
theological systems of Asia and Europe, as far as they have come
to our knowledge, were evidently derived.</p></note> graced his lofty brow.</l>

<p>The historian of the Incas relates that by the laws of the empire
none but sacred fire could be used in sacrifices; and that there
were three modes in which it might be procured. First, the
most sacred fire was that which was drawn immediately from
the sun himself by means of a concave mirror, which was usually
made of gold or silver highly polished. Second, in case of
cloudy weather or other accident, the fire might be taken from
the temple, where it was preserved by the holy virgins, whose
functions and discipline resembled those of the vestals of Rome.
Third, when the sacrifice was to be made in the provinces at
an inconvenient distance from the temple, and when the weather
was such as to prevent drawing the fire immediately from the
sun, it was permitted to procure it by the friction of two pieces
of dry wood.</p>
<p>The two latter modes were resorted to only in cases of necessity.
Not to be able to obtain fire by means of the mirror was a
bad omen, a sign of displeasure in the god; it cast a gloom over
the whole ceremony and threw the people into lamentations,
fearing their offering would not be well received.</p>
<p>This method of procuring fire directly from the sun, to burn
a sacrifice, must have appeared so miraculous to the savages who
could not understand it, that it doubtless had a powerful effect in
converting them to the solar religion and to the Incan government.</p></note> all the god exprest;</l>

<p>The Condor is supposed to be the largest bird of prey hitherto
known. His wings, from one extreme to the other, are said
to measure fifteen feet; he is able to carry a sheep in his talons,
and he sometimes attacks men. He inhabits the high mountains
of Peru, and is supposed by some authors to be peculiar to the
American continent. Buffon believes him to be of the same
species with the l&aelig;mer&hyphen;geyer (lamb&hyphen;vulture) of the Alps. The
similarity of their habitations favors this conjecture; but the
truth is, the Condor of Peru has not been well examined, and

<caption>No. 29.</caption>
<p><hi r="italic">Bartholomew de las Casas</hi> was a dominican priest of a most
amiable and heroic character. He first went to Hispaniola
with Columbus in his second voyage, where he manifested an
ardent but honest zeal, first in attempting to instruct the natives
in the principles of the catholic faith and afterwards in defending
them against the insufferable cruelties exercised by the
Spanish tyrants who succeeded Columbus in the discoveries and
settlements in South America. He early declared himself <hi r="italic">Protector
of the Indians</hi>; a title which seems to have been acknowledged
by the Spanish government. He devoted himself
ever after to the most indefatigable labors in the service of
that unhappy people. He made several voyages to Spain to
solicit, first from Ferdinand, then from cardinal Ximenes and
finally from Charles V, some effectual restrictions against the
horrid career of depopulation which every where attended the
Spanish arms. He followed these monsters of cruelty into all
the conquered countries; where, by the power of his eloquence
and that purity of morals which commands respect even from
the worst of men, he doubtless saved the lives of many thousands
of innocent people. His life was a continued struggle against
that deplorable system of tyranny, of which he gives a description
in a treatise addressed to Philip prince of Spain, entitled
<hi r="italic">Brevissima Relacion de la Destruycion de las Yndias</hi>.</p>
<p>It is said by the Spanish writers that the inhabitants of Hispaniola,
when first discovered by the Spaniards, amounted to
more than one million. This incredible population was reduced
in fifteen years to sixty thousand souls.</p>
<p><hi r="italic">Vincent Valverde</hi> was a fanatical priest who accompanied
Pizarro in his destructive expedition to Peru. If we were to
search the history of mankind we should not find another such example of the united efforts of ecclesiastical hypocrisy and
military ferocity, of unresisted murder and insatiable plunder,
as we meet with in the account of this expedition.</p>
<p>Father Valverde in a formal manner gave the sanction of the
church to the treacherous murder of Atabalipa and his relations;
which was immediately followed by the destruction and
almost entire depopulation of a flourishing empire.</p>
<p><hi r="italic">Pedro de la Gasca</hi> was one of the few men whose virtues form
a singular contrast with the vices which disgraced the age in
which he lived and the country in which he acquired his glory.
He was sent over to Peru by Charles V, without any military
force, to quell the rebellion of the younger Pizarro and to prevent
a second depopulation, by a civil war, of that country which
had just been drenched in the blood of its original inhabitants.
He effected this great purpose by the weight only of his personal
authority and the veneration inspired by his virtues. As soon as
he had suppressed the rebellion and established the government
of the colony he hastened to resign his authority into the hands of his master. And tho his victories had been obtained in the
richest country on earth he returned to Spain as poor as Cincinnatus;
having resisted every temptation to plunder and refused
to receive any emolument for his services.</p></note> best of men, shalt stay</l>

<p>Francis I, out of respect to the great learning and moderation
of Melancthon, and disregarding the pretended danger of discussing
the dogmas of the church, invited him to come to France
and establish himself at Paris; but the intrigues of the cardinal
de Tournon frustrated the king's intention.</p>
<p>If every leader of religious sects had possessed the amiable
qualities of Melancthon and every monarch who wished to oppose
the introduction of new opinions had partaken of the wisdom of
Francis, the blood of many hundreds of millions of the human
species, which has flowed at the shrine of fanaticism, would have
been spared. This circumstance alone would have made of human
society by this time a state totally different from what we actually
experience; and its influence on the progress of improvement in
national happiness and general civilization must have been beyond
our ordinary calculation.</p></note> and by men beloved.</l></pdiv>

<caption>No. 32.</caption>
<p>The British colonies in all their early struggles for existence
complained, and with reason, of the uniform indifference and
discouragement which they experienced from the government of
the mother country. But it was probably to that very indifference
that they owed the remarkable spirit of liberty and self
dependence which created their prosperity, by inducing them
uniformly to adopt republican institutions. These circumstances
prepared the way for that mutual confidence and federal union
which have finally formed them into a flourishing nation.</p>
<p>Ministers who feel their power over a distant colony to be uncontrolled
are so naturally inclined to govern too much, that
it may be a fortunate circumstance for the colony to be neglected
altogether. This neglect was indeed fatal to the first Virginia
settlers sent out by sir Walter Raleigh; and the companies who
afterwards succeeded in their establishments at Jamestown in
Virginia and at Plymouth in Massachusetts were very near
sharing the fate of their predecessors. But after these settlements
had acquired so much consistence as to assure their own
continuance, it may be assumed as an historical fact, that
the want of encouragement from government was rather beneficial
than detrimental to the British colonies in general.</p>
<p>These establishments were in the nature of private adventures,
undertaken by a few individuals at their own expense, rather
than organized colonies sent abroad for a public purpose. They
were companies incorporated for plantation and trade. All they
asked of the mother country (after obtaining acts of incorporation
enabling them to acquire property and exercise other <hi r="italic">civil</hi> functions,
such as incorporated companies at home could exercise)
was to give them charters of <hi r="italic">political</hi> franchise, ascertaining the
extent and limits of their rights and duties as subjects of the
British crown forming nations in parts of the earth that had been
found in an uncultivated state and far removed from the mother
country.</p>
<p>As they could not in this situation be represented in the parliament
of England, these charters stipulated their right of having
parliaments or legislative assemblies of their own, with executive
and judiciary institutions established within their territories.</p>
<p>The acknowledgment of these rights placed them on a different
footing from any other modern colonies; and the restricting
clause, by which their trade was confined to the mother country,
rendered their situation unlike that of the colonies of ancient
Greece. Indeed the British system of colonization in America
differed essentially from every other, whether ancient or modern;
if that may properly be called a system, which was rather the
result of early indifference to the cries of needy adventurers, and
subsequent attempts to seize upon their earnings when they became
objects of rapacity. This singular train of difficulties must be
considered as one of the causes of our ancient prosperity and
present freedom.</p></note> the plan,</l>

<caption>No. 33.</caption>
<p>The author of this poem will not be suspected of laying any
stress on the mere circumstance of lineage or birth, as relating
either to families or nations. The phrase, however, in the text
is not without its meaning. Among the colonies derived from
the several nations of Europe in modern times, those from the
English have flourished far better than the others, under a parity
of circumstances, such as climate, soil and productions. The
reason of this undeniable fact deserves to be explained.</p>
<p>Colonies naturally carry with them the civil, political and
religious institutions of their mother countries. These institutions
in England are much more favorable to liberty and the
development of industry than in any other part of Europe which
has sent colonies abroad. But this is not all: when men for
several generations have been bred up in the habit of feeling
and exercising such a portion of liberty as the English nation
has enjoyed, their minds are prepared to open and expand
themselves as occasion may offer. They are able to embrace
new circumstances, to perceive the improvements that may be
drawn from them, and not only make a temperate use of
that portion of self&hyphen;control to which they are accustomed, but
devise the means of extending it to other objects of their political
relations, till they become familiar with all the interests
of men in society.</p>
<p>The habitual use of the liberty of the press, of trial by jury
in open court, of the accountability of public agents and of
some voice in the election of legislators, must create, in a man
or a nation, a character quite different from what it could be
under the habitual disuse of these advantages. And when these
habits are transplanted with a young colony to a distant region
of the earth, enjoying a good soil and climate, with an unlimited
and unoccupied country, the difference will necessarily
be more remarkable.</p>
<p>A most striking illustration of this principle is exhibited in
the colonies of North America. This coast, from the St. Lawrence
to the Missisipi, was colonized by the French and English.
(I make no account of the Dutch establishment on the Hudson
nor of the Swedish on the Delaware; they being of little importance
and early absorbed in the English settlements.) If we
look back only one hundred years from the present time, we find
the French and English dominions here about equally important
in point of extent and population. The French Canada, Acadia,
Cape Breton, Newfoundland, Florida and Louisiana were then
as far advanced in improvement as the English settlements
which they flanked on each side. And the French had greatly
the advantage in point of soil, interior navigation and capability
of extension. They commanded and possessed the two great
rivers which almost met together on the English frontier. And
the space between the waters of those rivers on the west was
planted with French military posts, so as to complete the investment.</p>
<p>New Orleans was begun before Philadelphia and was much
better situated to become a great commercial capital. Quebec
and Montreal were older, and had the advantage of most of our
other cities. Add to this that the French nation at home was about
twice as populous as the English nation at home; and as that
part of the increase of colonial population which comes from emigration must naturally be derived from their respective
mother countries, it might have been expected that the comparative
rapidity of increase would have been in favor of the
French at least two to one.</p>
<p>But the French colonists had not been habituated to the use
of liberty before their emigration, and they were not prepared
nor permitted to enjoy it in any degree afterwards. Their laws
were made for them in their mother country, by men who
could not know their wants and who felt no interest in their
prosperity; and then they were administered by a set of agents
as ignorant as their masters; men who, from the nature of their
employment and accountability, must in general be oppressive
and rapacious.</p>
<p>The result has solved a great problem in political combination.
One of these clusters of colonies has grown to a powerful
empire, giving examples to the universe in most of the great
objects which constitute the dignity of nations. The other,
after having been a constant expense to the mother country
and serving for barter and exchange in the capricious vicissitudes
of European despotism, presents altogether at this day
a mass of population and wealth scarcely equal to one of our
provinces.</p>
<p>This note is written at the moment when Louisiana, one
of the most extensive but least peopled of the French colonies,
is ceded to the United States. The world will see how far the
above theory will now be confined by the rapid increase of
population and improvement in that interesting portion of our
continent</p></note> trace,</l>

<caption>No. 35.</caption>
<p><hi r="smcap">Ultima ratio regum</hi>: a device of Louis XIV, engraved on
his ordnance, and afterwards adopted by other powers. When
we consider men as reasonable beings and endowed with the
qualities requisite for living together in society, this device
looks like a satire upon the species; but in reality it only proves
the imperfect state to which their own principles of society
have yet advanced them in the long and perhaps interminable
progress of which they are susceptible. This <hi r="italic">ultima ratio</hi> being
already taken out of the hands of individuals and confided only
to the chiefs of nations, is as clear a proof of a great progress
already made, as its remaining in the hands of those chiefs is
a proof that we still remain far short of that degree of wisdom
and experience which will enable all the nations to live at peace
one with another.</p>
<p>There certainly was a time when the same device might have
been written on the hatchet or club or fist of every man; and
the best weapon of destruction that he could wield against his
neighbor might have been called <hi r="italic">ultima ratio virorum</hi>, meaning
that human reason could go no farther. But the wisdom we
have drawn from experience has taught us to restrain the use
of mortal weapons, making it unlawful and showing it to be
unreasonable to use them in private disputes. The principles
of social intercourse and the advantages of peace are so far
understood as to enable men to form great societies and to
submit their personal misunderstandings to common judges; thus
removing the <hi r="italic">ultima ratio</hi> from their own private hands to the
hands of their government.</p>
<p>Hitherto there has usually been a government to every nation;
but the nations are increasing in size and diminishing in number;
so that the hands which now hold the <hi r="italic">ultima ratio</hi> by delegation
are few, compared with what they have been. I mean
this observation to apply only to those extensions of nationality which have been formed on the true principles of society and
acquiesced in from a sense of their utility. I mean not to apply
it to those unnatural and unwieldy stretches of power, whose
overthrow is often and erroneously cited as an argument against
the progress of civilization; such as the conquests of Alexander,
the Roman generals, Omar, Gengis Khan and others of that
brilliant description. These are but meteors of compulsive force,
which pass away and discourage, rather than promote, the spirit
of national extension of which I speak.</p>
<p>This spirit operates constantly and kindly; nor is its progress
so slow but that it is easily perceived. Even within the short
memorials of modern history we find a heptarchy in England.
Ossian informs us that in his time there was a great number of
warlike states in Ireland and as many more in Scotland. Without
going back to the writings of Julius Cesar to discover the
comparative condition of France, we may almost remember
when she counted within her limits six or seven different governments,
generally at war among themselves and inviting foreign
enemies to come and help them to destroy each other. Every
province in Spain is still called a kingdom; and it is not long
since they were really so in fact, with the <hi r="italic">ultima ratio</hi> in the
hands of every king.</p>
<p>The publicist who in any of those modern heroic ages could
have imagined that all the hundred nations who inhabited the
western borders of Europe, from the Orknies to Gibraltar,
might one day become so far united in manners and interests
as to form but three great nations, would certainly have passed
for a madman. Had he been a minister of Pharamond or
of Fingal he could no more have kept his place than Turgot
could keep his after pointing out the means of promoting industry
and preventing wars. He would have been told that the
inhabitants of each side of the Humber were natural enemies
one to the other; that if their chiefs were even disposed to
live in peace they could not do it; their subjects would demand
war and could not live without it. The same would have been
said of the Seine, the Loire and every other dividing line between
their petty communities. It would have been insisted on that
such rivers were the natural boundaries of states and never
could be otherwise.</p>
<p>But now, since the people of those districts find themselves
no longer on the frontiers of little warlike states, but in the
centre of great industrious nations, they have lost their relish
for war and consider it as a terrible calamity. They cherish
the minister who gives them peace and abhor the one who
drives them into unnecessary wars. Their local disputes, which
used to be settled by the sword, are now referred to the tribunals
of the country. They have substituted a moral to a physical
force. They have changed the habits of plunder for those of
industry, and they find themselves richer and happier for the
change.</p>
<p>Who will say that the progress of society will stop short in the
present stage of its career? that great communities will not discover
a mode of arbitrating their disputes, as little ones have
done? that nations will not lay aside their present ideas of independence
and rivalship and find themselves more happy and
more secure in one great universal society, which shall contain
within itself its own principles of defence, its own permanent
security? It is evident that national security, in order to be permanent,
must be founded on the moral force of society at large,
and not on the physical force of each nation independently exerted.
The <hi r="italic">ultima ratio</hi> must not be a cannon, but a reference
to some rational mode of decision worthy of rational beings.</p></note></l>

<p>General Arnold, the leader of this detachment, had acquired
by this and many other brilliant achievements a degree of military
fame almost unequalled among the American generals. His
shameful defection afterwards, by the foulest of treason, should
be lamented as a national dishonor; it has not only obliterated
his own glory, but it seems in some sort to have cast a shade on
that of others whose brave actions had been associated with his
in the acquisition of their common and unadulterated fame.</p>
<p>The action here alluded to, the march thro the wilderness from
Casco to Quebec, was compared in the gazettes of that day to
the passage of the Alps by Hannibal. And really, considered as
a scene of true military valor, patient suffering and heroic exertion,
(detached from the idea of subsequent success in the ulterior
expedition) the comparison did not disgrace the Carthaginian.</p>
<p>Yet since the defection of Arnold, which happened five years
afterwards, this audacious and once celebrated exploit is scarcely
mentioned in our annals. And Meigs, Dearborn, Morgan and
other distinguished officers in the expedition, whom that alone
might have immortalized, have been indebted to their subsequent
exertions of patriotic valor for the share of celebrity their names
now enjoy.</p>

<p>The systematic and inflexible course of cruelties exercised by
the British armies on American prisoners during the three first
years of the war were doubtless unexampled among civilized
nations. Considering it as a war against rebels, neither their
officers nor soldiers conceived themselves bound by the ordinary
laws of war.</p>
<p>The detail of facts on this subject, especially in what concerned
the prison ships, has not been sufficiently noticed in our annals;
at least not so much noticed as the interest of public morals
would seem to require. Mr. Boudinot, who was the American
commissary of prisoners at the time, has since informed the
author of this poem that in one prison ship alone, called the
Jersey, which was anchored near Newyork, <hi r="italic">eleven thousand</hi> American
prisoners died in eighteen months; almost the whole of
them from the barbarous treatment of being stifled in a crowded
hold with infected air, and poisoned with unwholesome food.</p>
<p>There were several other prison ships, as well as the sugarhouse
prison in the city, whose histories ought to be better
known than they are. I say this not from any sort of enmity to
the British nation, for I have none. I respect the British nation;
as will be evident from the views I have given of her genius and
institutions in the course of this work. I would at all times
render that nation every service consistent with my duty to my
own; and surely it is worthy of her magnanimity to consider as
a real service every true information given her relative to the
crimes of her agents in distant countries. These crimes are as
contrary to the spirit of the nation at home as they are to the
temper of her laws.</p></note> Prison Ship's expanding womb</l>

<p>This was general sir John Johnson, an American royalist in
the British service. He was the son of sir William Johnson,
who had been a rich proprietor and inhabitant in the Mohawk
country in the colony of Newyork, and had been employed by
the king as superintendant of Indian affairs. Sir William had
married a Mohawk savage wife; and it was supposed that the
great influence which he had long exercised over that and the
neighboring tribes must have descended to his son. It was on
this account that he was employed on the expedition of Burgoyne,
in which he had the rank of brigadier general and the
special direction of the savages.</p></note> leads,</l>

<p>General sir Guy Carleton, afterwards lord Dorchester, was the
British governor of Canada and superintendant of Indian affairs
at the time of Burgoyne's campaign. Having great influence
with the warlike tribes who inhabited the west of Canada and
the borders of the lakes, he was ordered by the minister to adopt
the barbarous and unjustifiable measure of arming and bringing
them into the king's service in aid of this expedition.</p>
<p>This was doubtless done with the consent of Burgoyne, tho
he seems to have been apprehensive of the difficulty of managing
a race of men whose manners were so ferocious and whose motives
to action must have been so different from those of the
principal parties in the war. Burgoyne, in his narrative of this
campaign, informs us that he took precautions to discourage that
inhuman mode of warfare which had been customary among
those savages. He ordered them to kill none but such persons
as they should find in arms fighting against the king's troops;
to spare old men, women, children and prisoners, and not to
scalp any but such as they should kill in open war. He intimated
to them that he should not pay for any scalps but those thus
taken from enemies killed in arms.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate for the reputation of the general and of his
government, that they did not reflect on the futility of such an
order and the improbability of its being executed. A certain
price was offered for scalps; the savages must know that in a
bag of scalps, packed and dried and brought into camp and
counted out before the commissary to receive payment, it would
be impossible to distinguish the political opinions or the occupation,
age or sex of the heads to which they had belonged; it
could not be ascertained whether they had been taken from
Americans or British, whigs or tories, soldiers killed in arms or
killed after they had resigned their arms, militia men or peasants,
old or young, male or female.</p>
<p>The event proved the deplorable policy of employing such
auxiliaries, especially in such multitudes as were brought together
on this occasion. No sooner did hostilities begin between
the two armies than these people, who could have no knowledge
of the cause nor affection for either party, and whose only object
was plunder and pay, began their indiscriminate and ungovernable
ravages on both sides. They robbed and murdered peasants,
whether royalists or others; men, women, children, straggling
and wounded soldiers of both armies. The tragical catastrophe
of a young lady of the name of Macrea, whose story is
almost literally detailed in the foregoing paragraphs of the text,
is well known. It made a great impression on the public mind
at the time, both in England and America.</p>
<p>General Carleton, in the preceding campaigns, when the war
was carried into Canada, had been applauded for his humanity
in the treatment of prisoners. But the part he took in this
measure of associating the savages in the operations of the British
army was a stain upon his character; and the measure was highly
detrimental to the royal cause, on account of the general indignation
it excited thro the country.</p></note> and gave the savage hordes,</l>
<l ln="687    ">Thy boasted friends, by treaties brought from far</l>
<l ln="688    ">To aid thy master in his murderous war?</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="689    ">But now Britannia's chief, with proud disdain</l>
<l ln="690    ">Coopt in his camp, demands the field again,</l>

<p>The assumed right of kings or that supreme authority which
one man exercises over a nation, and for which he is not held
accountable, has been contended for on various grounds. It has
been sometimes called the <hi r="italic">right of conquest</hi>; in which is involved
the absolute disposal of the lives and labors of the conquered
nation, in favor of the victorious chief and his descendants to
perpetuity. Sometimes it is called the <hi r="italic">divine right</hi>; in which
case kings are considered as the vicegerents of God.</p>
<p>This notion is very ancient, and it is almost universal among
modern nations. Homer is full of it; and from his unaffected
recurrence to the same idea every where in his poems, it is evident
that in his day it was not called in question. The manner
in which the Jews were set at work to constitute their first king
proves that they were convinced that, if they must have a king,
he must be given them from God and receive that solemn consecration
which should establish his authority on the same divine
right which was common to other nations from whom they borrowed
the principle.</p>
<p>There are some few instances in history wherein this divine
right has been set aside; but it has generally been owing rather
to the violence of circumstances, which sometimes drive men
to act contrary to their prejudices, tho they still retain them,
than to any effort of reasoning by which they convinced themselves
that this was a prejudice and that no divine right existed
in reality. For it does not violate this supposed right to change
one king for another or one race of kings for another, tho done
in a manner the most unjust and inhuman. In this case the
same divine right remains and only changes, with the diadem,
from one head to another. And tho this change should happen
six times in one day (as in one instance it has done in Algiers
by the murder of six successive kings) they would still say it
was God who did it all; and the action would only tend to
prove to the credulous people, that God was made after their
own image, as changeable as themselves.</p>
<p>It is only in the case of Tarquin and a few others (whose
overthrow has been followed by a more popular form of government)
that it can be said that the principle of the divine right
has been disregarded, laid aside and forgotten for any length
of time.</p>
<p>The English are perhaps the first and only people that ever
overturned this doctrine of the divinity of kings, without changing
their form of government. This was brought on by circumstances
and took effect in the expulsion of James II. Books
were then written to prove that the divine right of kings did not
exist; at least, not in the sense in which it had been understood.
And these writings completely silenced the old doctrine in
England. This indeed was gaining an immense advantage in
favor of liberty; tho the effort of reason, to arrive at it, seems
to be so small.</p>
<p>But while the English were discarding the old principle they
set up a new one; which indeed is not so pernicious because
it cannot become so extensive, but which is scarcely more
reasonable: it is the right of kings by <hi r="italic">compact</hi>; that is a compact,
whether written or understood, by which the representatives
of a nation are supposed to bind their constituents and
their descendants to be the subjects of a certain prince and of
his descendants to perpetuity. This singular doctrine is developed
with perspicuity, but ill supported by argument, in Burke's
<hi r="italic">Reflections on the French Revolution</hi>.</p>
<p>The principle of the American government denies the right
of any representatives to make such a compact, and the right
of any prince to carry it into execution if it were made. Whatever
varieties or mixtures there may be in the <hi r="italic">forms</hi> of government,
there are but two distinct principles on which government
is founded. One supposes the source of power to be <hi r="italic">out</hi> of the
people and that the governor is not accountable to them for
the manner of using it; the other supposes the source of power
to be <hi r="italic">in</hi> the people and that the governor is accountable to them
for the manner of using it. The latter is our principle. In
this sense no <hi r="italic">right divine</hi> nor <hi r="italic">compact</hi> can form a king; that
is, a person exercising underived and unreverting power.</p></note> form a king;</l>

<caption>ARGUMENT.</caption>
<p>Hymn to Peace. Eulogy on the heroes slain in the war, in
which the Author finds occasion to mention his Brother. Address
to the patriots who have survived the conflict; exhorting
them to preserve the liberty they have established. The danger
of losing it by inattention illustrated in the rape of the Golden
Fleece. Freedom succeeding to Despotism in the moral world,
like Order succeeding to Chaos in the physical world. Atlas,
the guardian Genius of Africa, denounces to Hesper the crimes
of his people in the slavery of the Africans The Author addresses
his countrymen on that subject and on the principles of their
government.</p>
<p>Hesper, recurring to his object of showing Columbus the importance
of his discoveries, reverses the order of time, and exhibits
the continent again in its savage state. He then displays the
progress of arts in America. Fur trade. Fisheries. Productions.
Commerce. Education. Philosophical discoveries. Painting.
Poetry.</p></argument>

<caption>No. 45.</caption>
<p>Benjamin West, president of the Royal Academy in London,
was born and educated in Pennsylvania. At the age of twenty&hyphen;three
he went to Italy to perfect his taste in the art to which
his genius irresistibly impelled him; in which he was destined
to cast a splendor upon the age in which he lives and probably
to excel all his contemporaries, so far at least as we can judge
from the present state of their works. After passing two years
in that country of models, where canvas and marble seem to
contribute their full proportion of the population, he went to
London.</p>
<p>Here he soon rendered himself conspicuous for the boldness
of his designs, in daring to shake off the trammels of the art
so far as to paint modern history in modern dress. He had
already staggered the connoisseurs in Italy while he was there,
by his picture of <hi r="italic">The Savage Chief taking leave of his family
on going to war</hi>. This extraordinary effort of the American
pencil on an American subject excited great admiration at Venice.
The picture was engraved in that city by Bartolozzi, before
either he or West went to England. The artists were surprised
to find that the expression of the passions of men did not depend
on the robes they wore. And his early works in London,
<hi r="italic">The Death of Wolfe, The Battles of the Boyne, Lahogue</hi>, etc.
engraved by Woollett and others, not only established his
reputation, but produced a revolution in the art. So that
modern dress has now become as familiar in fictitious as in
real life; it being justly considered essential in painting modern
history.</p>
<p>The engraving from his Wolfe has been often copied in
France, Italy and Germany; and it may be said that in this
picture the revolution in painting really originated. It would
now be reckoned as preposterous in an artist to dress modern
personages in Grecian or Roman habits, as it was before to
give them the garb of the age and country to which they
belonged.</p>
<p>The merit of Mr. West was early noticed and encouraged
by the king; who took him into pay with a convenient salary,
and the title of historical painter to his majesty. In this situation
he has decorated the king's palaces, chapels and churches
with most of those great pictures from the English history and
from the Old and New Testament, which compose so considerable
a portion of his works.</p>
<p>The following catalogue of his pictures was furnished me by
Mr. West himself in the year 1802. It comprises only his
principal productions in <hi r="italic">historical</hi> painting, and only his <hi r="italic">finished</hi>
pictures; without mentioning his numerous portraits or his
more numerous sketches and drawings.</p>
<p>The pictures marked thus &ast; have been engraved. The ciphers
express the size of the pictures. When the same subject
is mentioned more than once, there is more than one picture
on that subject.</p>

<p>Besides the two hundred and ninety&hyphen;nine large finished pictures
here mentioned, Mr. West has done about one hundred
portraits, and upwards of two hundred drawings with the pen;
which last, for sublimity of conception, are among the finest of
his works. So that the whole of his pieces amount to above
six hundred Some of them are larger in size than any in the
national gallery of France; and he has not been assisted by any
other painter.</p>
<p>Mr. West is now about sixty&hyphen;eight years of age. He discovers
no abatement in the activity of his genius, nor in the laborious
exercise of his talents. He has painted several fine pictures
since the above catalogue was made, three of which I have
particularly noticed in his painting room: Tobet and Tobias
with the fish; Abraham sending away Hagar with her child;
Achilles receiving from Thetis the new armour; and we hear
that he has lately painted the Death of Nelson. He may yet
produce many more original works; tho it is presumed he has
already exceeded all other historical painters, except Rubens,
in the number and variety of his productions. With regard to
the merit of his pictures I cannot pretend to form a judgment
that would be of any use in directing that of others. He is
doubtless the most classical painter, except Raphael, whose works
are known to us.</p>
<p>The critics find fault with the coloring of Mr. West. But in
his works, as in those of Raphael, we do not look for coloring.
It is dignity of character, fine expression, delicate design, correct
drawing and beautiful disposition of drapery which fix the suffrage
of the real judge. All which qualities can only spring
from an elevated mind.</p></note> with his own great soul the canvas warms,</l>

<caption>ARGUMENT.</caption>
<p>Vision suspended. Night scene, as contemplated from the
mount of vision. Columbus inquires the reason of the slow progress
of science, and its frequent interruptions. Hesper answers,
that all things in the physical, as well as the moral and intellectual
world, are progressive in like manner. He traces their progress
from the birth of the universe to the present state of the earth and
its inhabitants; asserts the future advancement of society, till perpetual
peace shall be established. Columbus proposes his doubts;
alleges in support of them the successive rise and downfal of
ancient nations; and infers future and periodical convulsions.
Hesper, in answer, exhibits the great distinction between the
ancient and modern state of the arts and of society. Crusades.
Commerce. Hanseatic League. Copernicus. Kepler. Newton.
Galileo. Herschel. Descartes. Bacon. Printing press. Magnetic
Needle. Geographical discoveries. Federal system in America.
A similar system to be extended over the whole earth. Columbus
desires a view of this.</p></argument>

<caption>No. 47.</caption>
<p>The state of the arts and sciences among the ancients, viewed
with reference to the event of universal civilization, was faulty
in two respects. First, in their comparative estimation: Second,
in their flourishing only in one nation at a time. These circumstances
might be favorable to the exertions of individual
genius; and they may be assigned both as causes of the universal
destruction of the arts and sciences by the Gothic conquest, and
as reasons why we should not greatly lament that destruction.</p>
<p>From the political state of mankind in the days of their ancient
splendor it was natural that those arts which depend on the
imagination, such as Architecture, Statuary, Painting, Eloquence
and Poetry, should claim the highest rank in the estimation of
a people. In several, perhaps all of these, the ancients remain
unrivalled. But these are not the arts which tend the most to
the general improvement of society. A man in those days would
have rendered more service to the world by ascertaining the
true figure and movements of the earth, than by originating a
heaven and filling it with all the gods of Homer; and had the
expenses of the Egyptian pyramids been employed in furnishing
ships of discovery and sending them out of the Mediterranean,
the nations called civilized would not have been afterwards
overrun by Barbarians.</p>
<p>But the sciences of Geography, Navigation and Commerce,
with their consequent improvements in Natural Philosophy and
humanity, could not, from the nature of things at that time,
become objects of great encouragement or enterprise. Talent
was therefore confined to the cultivation of arts more striking
to the senses. As these arts were adapted to gratify the vanity
of princes, to help to carry on the sacred frauds of priests, to fire
the ambition of heroes, or to gain causes in popular assemblies,
they were brought to a degree of perfection which prevented
their being relished or understood by barbarous neighbors.</p>
<p>The improvements of the world, therefore, whether in literature,
sciences or arts, descended with the line of conquest
from one nation to another, till the whole were concentred
in the Roman empire. Their tendency there was to inspire a
contempt for nations less civilized, and to teach the Romans
to consider all mankind as the proper objects of their military
despotism. These circumstances prepared, thro a course of ages,
and finally opened a scene of wretchedness at which the human
mind has been taught to shudder. But some such convulsion
seemed necessary to reduce the nations to a position capable
of commencing regular improvements. And, however novel
the sentiment may appear, I will venture to say that, as to the
prospect of universal civilization, mankind were in a better
situation in the time of Charlemagne than they were in the
days of Augustus.</p>
<p>The final destruction of the Roman empire left the nations
of Europe in circumstances similar to each other; and their
consequent rivalship prevented any disproportionate refinement
from appearing in any particular region. The principles of
government, firmly rooted in the Feudal System, unsocial and
unphilosophical as they were, laid the foundation of that balance
of power which discourages the Cesars and Alexanders of modern
ages from attempting the conquest of the world.</p>
<p>It seems necessary that the arrangement of events in civilizing
the world should be in the following order: <hi r="italic">first</hi>, all
parts of it must be considerably peopled; <hi r="italic">second</hi>, the different
nations must be known to each other; <hi r="italic">third</hi>, their wants must
be increased, in order to inspire a passion for commerce. The
first of these objects was not probably accomplished till a late
period. The second for three centuries past has been greatly
accelerated. The third is a necessary consequence of the two
former. The spirit of commerce is happily calculated to open
an amicable intercourse between all countries, to soften the
horrors of war, to enlarge the field of science and to assimilate
the manners, feelings and languages of all nations. This
leading principle, in its remoter consequences, will produce
advantages in favor of free government, give patriotism the
character of philanthropy, induce all men to regard each other
as brethren and friends and teach them the benefits of peace
and harmony among the nations.</p>
<p>I conceive it no objection to this theory that the progress
has hitherto been slow; when we consider the magnitude of
the object, the obstructions that were to be removed, and the
length of time taken to accomplish it. The future progress
will probably be more rapid than the present. Since the invention
of printing, the application of the properties of the
magnet and the knowledge of the structure of the solar system,
it is difficult to conceive of a cause that can produce a new
state of barbarism; unless it be some great convulsion in the
physical world, so extensive as to change the face of the earth
or a considerable part of it. This indeed may have been the
case already more than once, since the earth was first peopled
with men and antecedent to our histories. But such events
have nothing to do with the present argument.</p></note> of old,</l>

<p>The planet discovered by Herschel was called by him
Georgium Sidus; but in all countries except England it is named
Herschel and probably will be so named there after his death
and that of the patron to whom his gratitude led him to make
this extraordinary dedication.</p>
<p>I would observe that, besides the impropriety of giving it another
name than that of the discoverer, it is inconvenient to use
a double name or a name composed of two words. Let it be
either George or Herschel.</p>
<p>The passage referred to in this note was written before the
discovery of the three other planets which are now added to
our catalogue. Could my voice have weight in deciding on the
names to be given to these new children of the sun, I would call
them by names of their respective discoverers, Piazzi, Olbers
and Harding, instead of the senseless and absurd appellations of
Ceres, Pallas and Juno. The former method would at least
assist us in preserving the history of science; the latter will only
tend farther to confuse a very ancient mythology which is already
extremely confused, and increase the difficulty of following the
faint traces of real knowledge that seems couched under the
mass of that mythology; traces which may one day lead to many

<caption>No. 49.</caption>
<p>A most useful book might be written on this subject. It should
be a Review of Poets and Historians, as to the moral and political
tendency of their works. It should likewise treat of the importance
of the task assigned to these two classes of writers. It might
attempt to point out the true object they ought to have in view;
perhaps do this with such clearness and energy as to gain the
attention of writers as well as readers, and thus serve in some
measure as a guide to future historians and poets. At least it
would prove a guide to readers; and by teaching them how to
judge, and what to praise or blame in the accounts of human
actions, whether real or fictitious, the public taste would be reformed
by degrees. In this case the recorders of heroic actions,
as well as the authors of them, would find it necessary to follow
this reform, or they must necessarily fail of obtaining the celebrity
to which they all aspire.</p>
<p>I think every person who will give himself the trouble to form
an opinion on the manner in which actions, called heroic, have
been recorded, must find it faulty; and must lament, as one of
the misfortunes of society, that writers of these two classes almost
universally, from Homer down to Gibbon, have led astray the
moral sense of man. In this view we may say in general of poets
and historians, as we do of their heroes, that they have injured
the cause of humanity almost in proportion to the fame they
have acquired.</p>
<p>I would not be understood by this observation to mean that
such writers have done no good. Even the works of Homer,
which have caused more mischief to mankind than those of any
other, have likewise been a fruitful source of a certain species of
benefits. They elevate the mind of every reader; they have
called forth great exertions of genius in poets, artists, philosophers
and heroes, thro a long succession of ages. But it remains
to be considered what a fruitful source they have likewise been
of those false notions of honor and erroneous systems of policy
which have governed the actions of men from his day to ours.</p>
<p>If, instead of the Iliad, he had given us a work of equal splendor
founded on an opposite principle, whose object should have
been to celebrate the useful arts of agriculture and navigation;
to build the immortal fame of his heroes and occupy his whole
hierarchy of gods, on actions that contribute to the real advancement
of society, instead of striking away every foundation on
which society ought to be established or can be greatly advanced;
mankind, enriched with such a work at that early period, would
have given an useful turn to their ambition thro all succeeding ages.</p>
<p>It is not easy to conceive how different the state of nations
would have been at this day from what we now find it, had
such a bent been given to the pursuits of genius and such glory
cast upon actions truly worthy of imitation. I have treated this
subject more at large in the third chapter of <hi r="italic">Advice to the Privileged
Orders</hi>.</p>
<p>But it will be asked how this kind of censure can attach to the
writers of history, whose business is to invent nothing, to confine
themselves to the simple narration of facts and relate the actions
of men, not as they should be, but as they are. This is indeed
a part of the duty of the historian; but it is not his whole duty.
His narrative should be clear and simple; but he should likewise
develop the political and moral tendency of the transactions he
details.</p>
<p>In reviewing actions or doctrines which favor despotism, injustice,
false morals or political errors, he should not suffer them to
pass without an open and well supported censure. He should
show how the authors of such actions might have conducted
themselves and succeeded in gaining the celebrity which they
sought, by doing good instead of harm to the age and country
where they acquired their fame.</p>
<p>The history of human actions, in a political view, has generally
been the history of human errors. The writers who
have given it to us do not appear to have been sensible of this.
How then are young readers to be sensible of it? Their minds
are still to be formed; and those who are destined for public
life must in a great measure take their bias from the study of
history. But history in general, to answer the purpose of
sound instruction to the future guides of nations, must be
rewritten. For example: among the hundred historians who
have treated of what is called the Roman Republic I know
not one who has told us this important fact, that Rome never
had a Republic. The same may be said of Athens, and of
several other turbulent associations of men in former ages. And
it is for want of this attention or this knowledge in the writers
of their histories, that the republican principle of government
is so generally associated, even at this day, with the idea of
insurrection, anarchy and the desire of conquest. Whereas it
is in fact the <hi r="italic">want</hi> of the republican principle, not the <hi r="italic">practice</hi>
of it, which has occasioned all the insurrections, anarchy and
desire of conquest, that have disturbed the order of society
both in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Again: in relating the destruction of Carthage, a measure
which the zealous patriots, both before and after, considered
so essential to the glory of the Roman state, and which has
immortalized so many heroes as the authors and projectors of
that destruction, I believe no historian has told us that the
disease, decay and downfal of Rome itself were occasioned by
that measure and must be dated from that epoch; and that
the actions of Regulus and Scipio, the themes of universal applause,
were really more injurious to their country than those
of Marius and Sylla, the objects (and justly so) of universal
detestation.</p>
<p>If these principles had been understood by Polybius and his
successors in the brilliant heritage of history and had been properly
impressed on the minds of their readers, we should not
have heard old Cato's vociferation <hi r="italic">delenda est Carthago</hi> applied
to the American states by an orator of the British parliament,
as we did during the war; because every member of that
parliament must have understood that the prosperity of these
states would be highly advantageous to Britain, from the
extensive commercial intercourse that the relative situation of
the two countries required. Neither should we see at this day
the French and English nations seeking to impoverish and extirpate
each other; each of them entertaining the erroneous
and absurd opinion that its own prosperity is to be increased
by the adversity of its neighbor. We should have learned long
ago from the plain dictates of reason, instead of having it beat
into us some ages hence by costly experience, that the true
dignity of a state is in the happiness of its members; and that
their happiness is best promoted by the pursuit of industry at
home and the free exchange of their productions abroad.</p>
<p>We should have perceived the real and constant interest
that every nation has in the prosperity of its neighbors, instead
of their destruction. France would have perceived that the
wealth of the English would be beneficial to her, by enabling
them to receive and pay for more of her produce. England
would have seen the same thing with regard to the French;
and such would have been the sentiments of other nations
reciprocally and universally.</p>
<p>I know I must be called an extravagant theorist if I insinuate
that all these good things would have resulted from having
history well written and poetry well conceived. No man will
doubt however that such would have been the tendency; nor
can we deny that the contrary has resulted, at least in some
degree, from the manner in which such writings have been
composed. And why should we write at all, if not to benefit
mankind? The public mind, as well as the individual mind,
receives its propensities; it is equally the creature of habit.
Nations are educated, like a single child. They only require
a longer time and a greater number of teachers.</p></note> with a tyrant's name.</l>

<caption>No. 50.</caption>
<p>Absurdities in speculative opinion are commonly considered
as innocent things; and we are told every day that they are
not worth refuting. So far as opinions are sure to rest merely
in speculation and cannot in any degree become practical, this
is doubtless the proper way of treating them. But there are
few opinions of this dormant and indifferent kind, especially
among those that become general and classical among the
nations.</p>
<p>The activity of such, tho imperceptible, is extensive. They
get wrought into our intellectual existence and govern our
modes of acting as well as thinking. The interest of society
therefore requires that they should be scrutinized, and that
such as are erroneous should be exposed, in order to be
rejected; when their place may be supplied by truth and
reason, which nourish the mind and accelerate the progress
of improvement.</p>
<p>Among the absurd notions which early turned the heads of
the teachers of mankind and which are so ridiculous as generally
to escape our censure, is that of a Golden Age; or the
idea that men were more perfect, more moral and more happy
in some early stage of their intercourse, before they cultivated
the earth and formed great societies.</p>
<p>The author of Don Quixote has played his artillery upon
this doctrine to very good effect; he has summoned against it
all the force of our contempt by making it the text of one of
the gravest discourses of his hero. But my sensibility is such
on moral and political errors, as rarely to be satisfied with the
weapon of ridicule; tho I know it to be one of the most mortal
of intellectual weapons.</p>
<p>The notion that the social state of men cannot meliorate,
that they have formerly been better than they now are, and
that they are continually growing worse, is pregnant with infinite
mischief. I know no doctrine in the whole labyrinth of
imposture that has a more immoral tendency. It discourages
the efforts of all political virtue; it is a constant and practical
apology for oppression, tyranny, despotism, in every shape, in
every corner of society, as well as from the throne, the pulpit,
the tribunal and the camp. It inculcates the belief that ignorance
is better than knowledge; that war and violence are more
natural than industry and peace; that deserts and tombs are more
glorious than joyful cities and cultivated fields.</p>
<p>One of the most operative means of bringing forward our
improvements and of making mankind wiser and better than
they are, is to convince them that they are capable of becoming
so. Without this conviction they may indeed improve slowly,
unsteadily and almost imperceptibly, as they have done within
the period in which our histories are able to trace them. But
this conviction, impressed on the minds of the chiefs and teachers
of nations, and inculcated in their schools, would greatly expedite
our advancement in public happiness and virtue. Perhaps it
would in a great measure insure the world against any future
shocks and retrograde steps, such as heretofore it has often
experienced.</p></note> to man,</l>

<p><hi r="smcap">Tho</hi> it would be more convenient to the reader to find some of
these notes, especially the shorter ones, at the bottom of the
pages to which they refer, yet most of them are of such a length
as would render that mode of placing them disadvantageous to
the symmetry of the pages and the general appearance of the
work. It seemed necessary that these should be collected at the
end of the volume; and it was thought proper that the others
should not be separated from them.</p>
<p>The notes will probably be found too voluminous for the taste of
some readers; but others would doubtless be better pleased to see
them still augmented, as several of the philosophical subjects and
historical allusions are left unexplained. Were I to offer apologies
in this case, I should hardly know on which side to begin. I will
therefore only say that in this appendage, as in the body of the
work, I have aimed, as well as I was able, at blending in due
proportions the useful with the agreeable.</p></note>

<epilogue>
<caption>POSTSCRIPT.</caption>
<p><hi r="smcap">I am</hi> well aware that some readers will be dissatisfied in certain
instances with my orthography. Their judgments are respectable;
and as it is not a wanton deviation from ancient usage
on my part, the subject may justify a moment's retrospect from
this place. Since we have arrived at the end of a work that
has given me more pleasure in the composition than it can give
me in its reception by the public, they must pardon me if I
thus linger awhile in taking leave. It has been a favorite object
of amusement as well as labor, which I cannot hope to replace.</p>
<p>Our language is constantly and rapidly improving. The unexampled
progress of the sciences and arts for the last thirty years
has enriched it with a great number of new words, which are
now become as necessary to the writer as his ancient mother
tongue. The same progress which leads to further extensions
of ideas will still extend the vocabulary; and our neology must
and will keep pace with the advancement of our knowledge.
Hence will follow a closer definition and more accurate use of
words, with a stricter attention to their orthography.</p>
<p>Such innovations ought undoubtedly to be admitted with caution;
and they will of course be severely scrutinized by men of
letters. A language is public property, in the most extensive
sense of the word; and readers as well as writers are its guardians.
<pb n="436">
But they ought to have no objection to improving the
estate as it passes thro their hands, by making a liberal tho rigid
estimate of what may be offered as meliorations. Some respectable
philologists have proposed a total and immediate reform
of our orthography and even of our alphabet; but the great body
of proprietors in this heritage are of opinion that the attempt
would be less advantageous than the slow and certain improvements
which are going forward, and which will necessarily
continue to attend the active state of our literature.</p>
<p>We have long since laid aside the Latin diphthongs <hi r="italic">&aelig;</hi> and <hi r="italic">&oelig;</hi>
in common English words, and in some proper names tho not
in all. Uniformity in this respect is desirable and will prevail.
Names of that description which occur in this work I have therefore
written with the simple vowel, as <hi r="italic">Cesar, Phenicia, Etna,
Medea</hi>.</p>
<p>Another class of our words are in a gradual state of reform.
They are those Latin nouns ending in <hi r="italic">or</hi>, which having past
through France on their way from Rome, changed their <hi r="italic">o</hi>
into <hi r="italic">eu</hi>. The Norman English writers restored the Latin <hi r="italic">o</hi>
but retained the French <hi r="italic">u</hi>; and tho the latter has been since
rejected in most of these words, yet in others it is still retained
by many writers. It is quite useless in pronunciation; and propriety
as well as analogy requires that the reform should be
carried thro. No writer at this day retains the <hi r="italic">u</hi> in <hi r="italic">actor,
author, emperor</hi> and the far greater part, perhaps nine tenths,
of this class of nouns; why then should it be continued in the
few that remain, such as <hi r="italic">labor, honor</hi>? The most accurate
authors reject it in all these, and I have followed the example.</p>
<p>I have also respectable authorites in prose as well as poetry
for expunging the three last letters in <hi r="italic">though</hi> and <hi r="italic">through</hi>;
they being totally disregarded in pronunciation and awkward
in appearance. The long sound of <hi r="italic">o</hi> in many words, as <hi r="italic">go, fro</hi>,
puts it out of doubt with respect to <hi r="italic">tho</hi>; and its sound of <hi r="italic">oo</hi>,
which frequently occurs, as in <hi r="italic">prove, move</hi>, is an equal justification
of <hi r="italic">thro</hi>. All the British poets, from Pope downwards,
<pb n="437">
and several eminent prose writers, including Shaftsbury and
Staunton, have by their practice supported this orthography.</p>
<p>Some verbs in the past tense, where the usual ending in <hi r="italic">ed</hi>
is harsh and uncouth, have long ago changed it for <hi r="italic">t</hi>, as <hi r="italic">fixt,
capt, meant, past, blest</hi>. Poetry has extended this innovation
to many other verbs which are necessarily uttered with the
sound of <hi r="italic">t</hi>, tho in prose they may still retain for a while their
ancient <hi r="italic">ed</hi>.. I consider this reform as a valuable improvement
in the language, because it brings a numerous class of words
to be written as they are spoken; and the proportion of the
reformed ones is already so considerable that analogy, or regularity
of conjugation, requires us to complete the list. I have
not carried this reform much farther than other poets have done
before me. Examples might perhaps be found for nearly all
the instances in which I have indulged it, such as <hi r="italic">perisht,
astonisht</hi>, tho I have not been solicitous to seek them. The
correction might well be extended to several remaining verbs
of the same class; but it is difficult in this particular case to
fix the proper limit.</p>
<p>With regard to the apostrophe, as employed to mark the
elision in the past tense of verbs, I have followed the example
of the most accurate poets; who use it where the verb in the
present tense does not end in <hi r="italic">e</hi>, as <hi r="italic">furl'd</hi>, because the <hi r="italic">ed</hi>
would add a syllable and destroy the measure. But where the
present tense ends in <hi r="italic">e</hi>, it is retained in the past with the <hi r="italic">d</hi>,
as <hi r="italic">robed</hi>, because it does not add a syllable.</p>
<p>The letter <hi r="italic">k</hi> we borrowed from the Greek, and the <hi r="italic">c</hi> from
the Latin. The power of each of these letters at the end of a
word is precisely the same; and the power of one is the same
as that of both. Yet our early writers placed them both at the
end of certain words, with the <hi r="italic">c</hi> before the <hi r="italic">k</hi>, as <hi r="italic">musick,
publick</hi>; why they did not put the <hi r="italic">k</hi> first, as being the most
ancient character, does not appear. Modern authors have rejected
the <hi r="italic">k</hi> at the end of this class of words; and no correct
writer will think of replacing such an inconvenient appendage.</p>
<pb n="438">
<p>The idea of putting a stop to innovation in a living language
is absurd, unless we put a stop to thinking. When a language
becomes fixt it becomes a dead language. Men must leave it
for a living one, in which they can express their ideas with
all their changes, extensions and corrections. The duty of the
critic in this case is only to keep a steady watch over the
innovations that are offered, and require a rigid conformity to
the general principles of the idiom. Noah Webster, to whose
philological labors our language will be much indebted for its
purity and regularity, has pointed out the advantages of a steady
course of improvement, and how it ought to be conducted.
The Preface to his new Dictionary is an able performance. He
might advantageously give it more development, with some
correction, and publish it is as a Prospectus to the great work
he now has in hand.</p>
<p>The uniform tendency of our language is towards simplicity
as well as regularity. With this view the final <hi r="italic">e</hi>, in words where
it is quite silent and useless, is dropping off, and will soon disappear.
Having long since resigned the place it held in the greater
part of these words, as <hi r="italic">joye, ruine</hi>, and more recently in some
others, it must finally quit the remainder where it is still found
a superfluous letter, as <hi r="italic">active, decisive, determine</hi>.</p>
<p>We may even hazard a prediction that our whole class of
adjectives ending in <hi r="italic">ous</hi> will be reformed and brought nearer
to their pronunciation by rejecting the <hi r="italic">o</hi>. A similar change may
be expected in words ending in <hi r="italic">ss</hi>. These words have already
undergone one reform; they were formerly written with a final
<hi r="italic">e</hi>, as <hi r="italic">wildernesse</hi>. They have lost the <hi r="italic">e</hi> because it was useless;
and as the final <hi r="italic">s</hi> has now become equally useless, it might be
dismissed with as little violence to the language. But these
two projected innovations have not yet been ventured upon
in any degree; and it is not desirable to be the first in so
daring an enterprise, when it is not immediately important.</p></epilogue></poem>

A Duke of Cumberland, in order to become an Alexander, had to ride all the way to Culloden, and back again to London. Louis the Fourteenth was obliged to submit to the fatigue of being carried on board of a splendid barge, and rowed across the Rhine, about the same time that the French army crossed it; and all this for the simple privilege of being placed above the Macedonian in the temple of Fame; and of causing this atchievement to be celebrated, as more glorious than the passing of the Granicus: as may be seen on that modest monument in the <hi r="italic">Place Vendome</hi> in Paris.</p>
<p>The Count d'Artois has purchased, at a still dearer rate, the fame of being styled &ldquo;<hi r="italic">le digne rejeton du grand Henri</hi>,&rdquo; and of being destined to command all the armies of Europe in re&hyphen;establishing the Monarchy of France. This champion of Christendom set out, at the age of twenty&hyphen;five, and travelled by land with a princely equipage, from Paris to Gibraltar; where he arrived just in time to see, at a convenient distance, Elliot's famous bonfire of the floating batteries. He then returned, covered with glory, by the way of Madrid; and arrived at Versailles, amidst the caresses of the court and the applauses of all Europe. The accomplishment of this arduous enterprise has deservedly placed him, in point of military fame, at the head of all the present branches of the illustrious house of Bourbon.</p></note>?</l></pdiv>

<l ln="2        ">Tho' doubting senates ask thy aid in vain;</l>
<l ln="3        ">&indent;Attend the drooping virtues round thy tomb,</l>
<l ln="4        ">And hear a while the orphan'd Muse complain.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="5        ">&indent;The Muse which thy indulgence bade aspire,</l>
<l ln="6        ">And dare pursue thy distant steps to fame;</l>
<l ln="7        ">&indent;At thy command she first assum'd the lyre,</l>
<l ln="8        ">And hop'd a future laurel from thy name.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="9        ">&indent;How did thy smiles awake her infant song!</l>
<l ln="10      ">How did thy virtues animate the lay!</l>
<l ln="11      ">&indent;Still shall thy fate the dying strain prolong,</l>
<l ln="12      ">And bear her voice with thy lost form away.</l></stanza>
<pb n="6">
<stanza><l ln="13      ">&indent;Come to my soul thou venerable Sage,</l>
<l ln="14      ">In all the sheeted majesty of night,</l>
<l ln="15      ">&indent;Snatch the bold quill, control the noble rage,</l>
<l ln="16      ">And seize the raptur'd fancy in her flight.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="17      ">&indent;Come in the form that shadowy spirits dress,</l>
<l ln="18      ">When death's dim vail hath shrouded all their pride,</l>
<l ln="19      ">&indent;While yon tall cloud but emulates thy face,</l>
<l ln="20      ">Where the lone moonbeam trembles thro' its side.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="21      ">&indent;Come on the gale that listening midnight heaves,</l>
<l ln="22      ">When glare ey'd phantoms, bending with a bier,</l>
<l ln="23      ">&indent;Stalk thro' the mist, ascend the sounding graves,</l>
<l ln="24      ">And wake wild wonders in the startled ear.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="25      ">&indent;In this dread scene no more the wonted sires</l>
<l ln="26      ">Kindle my breast or ope a wish within,</l>
<l ln="27      ">&indent;The soul, distracted from herself retires,</l>
<l ln="28      ">And sighs to mingle and to soar with thine.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="29      ">&indent;And where, thou blest immortal art thou flown?</l>
<l ln="30      ">Can these deep shades detain thy willing ear?</l>
<l ln="31      ">&indent;Canst thou from loaded breezes hear a groan?</l>
<l ln="32      ">Or stain thy spotless mantle with a tear?</l></stanza>

<l ln="34      ">Borne in the music of a once lov'd strain,</l>
<l ln="35      ">&indent;Approach th'unbodied mansion of the mind?</l>
<l ln="36      ">Or bend one pitying look to earth again?</l></stanza>
<pb n="7">
<stanza><l ln="37      ">&indent;Can thence no thought to that fair seat descend?</l>
<l ln="38      ">The seat once joyous in thy joys below,</l>
<l ln="39      ">&indent;Where robes of fable sadness now depend,</l>
<l ln="40      ">And all the still solemnities of woe.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="41      ">&indent;Can the dear partner of thy tender years,</l>
<l ln="42      ">Sad as the misty fading face of even,</l>
<l ln="43      ">&indent;With all the wasted treasure of her tears,</l>
<l ln="44      ">Avert no smile nor bribe a care from heaven?</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="45      ">&indent;While that young throng, that dear deserted train,</l>
<l ln="46      ">Where thy lov'd image soften'd sweetness wears,</l>
<l ln="47      ">&indent;Swell with new tenderness each following pain,</l>
<l ln="48      ">And add unnumber'd, undivided cares.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="49      ">&indent;Around the fair one see their beauties bloom,</l>
<l ln="50      ">(Or wilt thou not the moving fair one heed?)</l>
<l ln="51      ">&indent;How their keen anguish points the distant tomb,</l>
<l ln="52      ">Where all their joys and every hope is fled!</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="53      ">&indent;So lonely Cynthia, on her evening throne,</l>
<l ln="54      ">And all her young&hyphen;ey'd planetary train,</l>
<l ln="55      ">&indent;In languid lustre seek their sire the sun,</l>
<l ln="56      ">Down the still chambers of the western main.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="57      ">&indent;Yet that broad splendor from his nightly race,</l>
<l ln="58      ">With rising radiance shall the day restore;</l>
<l ln="59      ">&indent;Another spring renews fair nature's face,</l>
<l ln="60      ">And years and ages die to waken more.</l></stanza>
<pb n="8">
<stanza><l ln="61      ">&indent;But thou alas! no more on earth wilt tread,</l>
<l ln="62      ">Nor one short hour thy blest employments leave,</l>
<l ln="63      ">&indent;Tho' the sad knell, that hail'd thee to the dead,</l>
<l ln="64      ">Had doom'd thy helpless country to her grave.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="65      ">&indent;Thy country, whose still supplicating moan,</l>
<l ln="66      ">Implores thy counsels with an infant cry;</l>
<l ln="67      ">&indent;And loads the same stern Angel with a groan,</l>
<l ln="68      ">Which bore thy kindling spirit to the sky.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="69      ">&indent;Wilt thou (since nothing here could bribe thy stay,</l>
<l ln="70      ">And nothing here can tempt thee from on high,</l>
<l ln="71      ">&indent;Since tears of innocence must idly stray,</l>
<l ln="72      ">And grateful millions breathe the fruitless sigh;</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="73      ">&indent;Since every tender tie that mortals prize,</l>
<l ln="74      ">And all that fame's immortal children gain,</l>
<l ln="75      ">&indent;Yield to th'untimely mandate of the skies,</l>
<l ln="76      ">And ask thy kind continuance still in vain;)</l></stanza>

<l ln="78      ">Where cares of empire claim th'eternal ear,</l>
<l ln="79      ">&indent;Among thy country's guardian seraphs prove</l>
<l ln="80      ">The hand to cherish and the heart to hear?</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="81      ">&indent;There while the dread sublimity of soul</l>
<l ln="82      ">O'er all the star&hyphen;eye'd heaven exalts thy throne,</l>
<l ln="83      ">&indent;While worlds beneath immeasurably roll,</l>
<l ln="84      ">And shew the well&hyphen;known circuit of thine own,</l></stanza>
<pb n="9">
<stanza><l ln="85      ">&indent;Wilt thou remark the bluely&hyphen;bending shore?</l>
<l ln="86      ">Where hills and champaigns stretch abroad their pride,</l>
<l ln="87      ">&indent;Where opening streams their lengthiest currents pour,</l>
<l ln="88      ">And heaps of heroes swell the crimson tide.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="89      ">&indent;Wilt thou recognize that confus'd uproar?</l>
<l ln="90      ">Towns curl'd in smoaky columns mounting high,</l>
<l ln="91      ">&indent;Mix'd with the clarion's desolating roar;</l>
<l ln="92      ">Rending and purpling all the nether sky.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="93      ">&indent;Amid the tumult, wilt thou see afar</l>
<l ln="94      ">Our laurel'd heroes striving for the day?</l>
<l ln="95      ">&indent;While clouds, unfolding, ope the wings of war,</l>
<l ln="96      ">Where the grim legions sweep the foes away.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="97      ">&indent;And while their deeds thy blest approvance claim,</l>
<l ln="98      ">While crouds of rival chiefs thy guidance share,</l>
<l ln="99      ">&indent;Behold that first, that finish'd heir of fame,</l>
<l ln="100    ">And be the best of heroes still thy care.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="101    ">&indent;That hero whose illuminating sword</l>
<l ln="102    ">Lights death and victory through the darken'd field,</l>
<l ln="103    ">&indent;Bids realms and ages waken at his word,</l>
<l ln="104    ">Their sire, their soul, their savior and their shield.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="105    ">&indent;Behold that Senate, whose delighted ear</l>
<l ln="106    ">With thy bold eloquence hath often rung,</l>
<l ln="107    ">&indent;Where trembling realms, for many a doubtful year,</l>
<l ln="108    ">Have learnt their sure salvation from thy tongue.</l></stanza>
<pb n="10">
<stanza><l ln="109    ">&indent;While cares of empires sit upon their brow,</l>
<l ln="110    ">And all th'increasing counsels of an age,</l>
<l ln="111    ">&indent;Demand, alike, bold virtue's warmest glow,</l>
<l ln="112    ">And the wide walks of science in the sage;</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="113    ">&indent;Let thy own wisdom's ever beaming light</l>
<l ln="114    ">Illume their well&hyphen;known dignity of soul,</l>
<l ln="115    ">&indent;Let thy benevolence their hearts unite,</l>
<l ln="116    ">And every voice, and every wish control.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="117    ">&indent;Lift the deep curtain from the vale of time,</l>
<l ln="118    ">Where unborn years their future circles wind,</l>
<l ln="119    ">&indent;Where the broad interests of a growing clime</l>
<l ln="120    ">Spread to all realms and regulate mankind.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="121    ">&indent;Unfold to their keen penetrating view,</l>
<l ln="122    ">What to the infant empire should be known,</l>
<l ln="123    ">&indent;That worlds' and ages' happiness or woe,</l>
<l ln="124    ">Hang on th'important issue of their own.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="125    ">&indent;And sure thou wilt that honor'd realm revere,</l>
<l ln="126    ">Where first thine early steps began their fame,</l>
<l ln="127    ">&indent;Where thy lov'd memory, ever doubly dear,</l>
<l ln="128    ">Awakes a tenderer tribute to thy name.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="129    ">&indent;Canst thou forget, when youthful years began,</l>
<l ln="130    ">Where opening science kindled every grace,</l>
<l ln="131    ">&indent;And smil'd to see, ascending in the man,</l>
<l ln="132    ">The friend the pride the glory of his race?</l></stanza>
<pb n="11">

<l ln="136    ">Compel'd attention and secur'd applause.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="137    ">&indent;Where rising worth thine early name enroll'd</l>

<l ln="140    ">Flame in the front of glory's deathless page.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="141    ">&indent;Attentive still to virtue's noble aim,</l>

<l ln="144    ">Sire of her sons, and guardian of her laws.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="145    ">&indent;And see! aloft in that sublime retreat,</l>
<l ln="146    ">Where injur'd rights obtain their last appeal,</l>
<l ln="147    ">&indent;How pensive justice o'er thy vacant seat,</l>
<l ln="148    ">With faltering hand suspends her turning scale.</l></stanza>

<stanza><l ln="153    ">&indent;When from all bounds of this extensive land,</l>
<l ln="154    ">Or where wide oceans spread their coasts abroad,</l>
<l ln="155    ">&indent;Dark causes rise, demanding from his hand,</l>
<l ln="156    ">Th'impartial deep discernment of a god;</l></stanza>
<pb n="12">

<l ln="159    ">&indent;Then drop thy own blest mantle from the skies,</l>
<l ln="160    ">And make the person as the place divine.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="161    ">&indent;He will, my friends&mdash;th'unbodied life above,</l>
<l ln="162    ">With every virtue brighten'd and refin'd,</l>
<l ln="163    ">&indent;That glow'd below, with patriotic love,</l>
<l ln="164    ">The love of happiness and human kind,</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="165    ">&indent;Will burn serener in a purer sky,</l>
<l ln="166    ">Where broader views and bolder thoughts unroll,</l>
<l ln="167    ">&indent;Where universal Being fills the eye,</l>
<l ln="168    ">And swells the unbounded wishes of the soul.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="169    ">&indent;No tender thought by heaven's own breath inspir'd,</l>
<l ln="170    ">Which taught the gentle bosom here to glow,</l>
<l ln="171    ">&indent;Which the warm breast with patriot ardor fir'd,</l>
<l ln="172    ">Or stole the secret tear for silent woe,</l></stanza>

<stanza><l ln="177    ">&indent;Fix'd in a brighter sphere, with surer aim,</l>
<l ln="178    ">Tho' greater scenes his growing views employ,</l>
<l ln="179    ">&indent;Yet Hosmer kindles with an Hosmer's flame,</l>
<l ln="180    ">And his dear country feeds his noblest joy.</l></stanza>
<pb n="13">

<l ln="183    ">&indent;Awake the mild magnificence of laws,</l>
<l ln="184    ">And roll down blessings on the stream of time.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="185    ">&indent;Nor think, O hapless fair one, tho' awhile,</l>
<l ln="186    ">From thy fond arms his happier spirit rove,</l>
<l ln="187    ">&indent;That soaring innocence can cease to smile,</l>
<l ln="188    ">Or his Seraphic bosom cease to love.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="189    ">&indent;In Heaven's own breast the self&hyphen;existent fires,</l>
<l ln="190    ">E'er time began, illum'd th'eternal flame,</l>
<l ln="191    ">&indent;Lit from the beam, the Archangellic quires</l>
<l ln="192    ">Preserve th'unchanging ardor still the same.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="193    ">&indent;And shall the heaven&hyphen;born spirit after death,</l>
<l ln="194    ">Robb'd of its virtues from its nature fly?</l>
<l ln="195    ">&indent;Or lose in climes of bliss the aspiring breath,</l>
<l ln="196    ">Which wing'd its passage to its kindred sky?</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="197    ">&indent;Think, in the chambers of eternal morn,</l>
<l ln="198    ">Where beauty blooms along the vernal vale,</l>
<l ln="199    ">&indent;Where loves and virtues every smile adorn,</l>
<l ln="200    ">And hymns of Angels swell the floating gale;</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="201    ">&indent;Think how his well&hyphen;known sympathy of soul</l>
<l ln="202    ">Views every pain thy tenderness can know;</l>
<l ln="203    ">&indent;Counts the full tears in silence as they roll,</l>
<l ln="204    ">And learns the tale of every speaking woe.</l></stanza>
<pb n="14">
<stanza><l ln="205    ">&indent;Thou knowst, while here, he joy'd to give relief,</l>
<l ln="206    ">To call dark merit to the eye of day,</l>
<l ln="207    ">&indent;To rob the silent orphan of her grief,</l>
<l ln="208    ">And breathe the sigh from innocence away.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="209    ">&indent;How did the trembling visage of the poor,</l>
<l ln="210    ">With grateful glow embolden at his smile!</l>
<l ln="211    ">&indent;And learn, well pleas'd, within his wonted door,</l>
<l ln="212    ">Its joys to cherish, and its cares beguile.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="213    ">&indent;Thou knowst his early wish began to prize</l>
<l ln="214    ">The bliss that wayward mortals seldom find,</l>
<l ln="215    ">&indent;That lifts the frequent suppliant to the skies,</l>
<l ln="216    ">While answering blessings fill the raptur'd mind.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="217    ">&indent;Know then, fair mourner, from the climes of day,</l>
<l ln="218    ">(While these drear shades of solitude you tread)</l>
<l ln="219    ">&indent;His unseen hand companion of thy way,</l>
<l ln="220    ">Thro' the dark paths thy wandering steps shall lead.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="221    ">&indent;While all thy virtues rise before the throne,</l>
<l ln="222    ">And all thy griefs be number'd in his sight,</l>
<l ln="223    ">&indent;Those shall refine and ripen with his own,</l>
<l ln="224    ">And these be hush'd in everlasting night.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="225    ">&indent;Thy children too, his images below,</l>
<l ln="226    ">Fair as young plants, and smiling as the morn,</l>
<l ln="227    ">&indent;With thy own loveliness shall learn to glow,</l>
<l ln="228    ">And all thy graces brighten and adorn.</l></stanza>
<pb n="15">
<stanza><l ln="229    ">&indent;Short is the date that virtue from its home,</l>
<l ln="230    ">In these deep shades, can suffer and refine;</l>
<l ln="231    ">&indent;And when kind heaven relieves it from the doom,</l>
<l ln="232    ">Ours be the choice to tremble and resign.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="233    ">&indent;Vain were the task, the daring thought were vain,</l>
<l ln="234    ">To check the sun's bold circuit as he flies;</l>
<l ln="235    ">&indent;Nor think the cling of fondness can detain</l>
<l ln="236    ">The soaring seraph from his kindred skies.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="237    ">&indent;Then cease, fond partner of his earthly joys,</l>
<l ln="238    ">And leave behind each unavailing care;</l>
<l ln="239    ">&indent;Think what a scene his happier slight employs,</l>
<l ln="240    ">And haste to meet him and to mingle there.</l></stanza></poem>

<l ln="2        ">To cramp the day and hide me from the skies;</l>
<l ln="3        ">Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurl'd,</l>
<l ln="4        ">Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world,</l>
<l ln="5        ">I sing not you. A softer theme I chuse,</l>
<l ln="6        ">A virgin theme, unconscious of the Muse,</l>
<l ln="7        ">But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire</l>
<l ln="8        ">The purest frenzy of poetic fire.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="2">
<pdiv><l ln="9        ">Despise it not, ye Bards to terror steel'd,</l>
<l ln="10      ">Who hurl'd your thunders round the epic field;</l>
<l ln="11      ">Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing</l>
<l ln="12      ">Joys that the vineyard and the still&hyphen;house bring;</l>
<l ln="13      ">Or on some distant fair your notes employ,</l>
<l ln="14      ">And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy.</l>
<l ln="15      ">I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel,</l>
<l ln="16      ">My morning incense, and my evening meal,</l>
<l ln="17      ">The sweets of Hasty&hyphen;Pudding. Come, dear bowl,</l>
<l ln="18      ">Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul.</l>
<l ln="19      ">The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine,</l>
<l ln="20      ">Its substance mingled, married in with thine,</l>
<l ln="21      ">Shall cool and temper thy superior heat,</l>
<l ln="22      ">And save the pains of blowing while I eat.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="23      ">Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song</l>
<l ln="24      ">Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue,</l>
<l ln="25      ">Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime,</l>
<l ln="26      ">And, as they roll in substance, roll in rhyme,</l>
<l ln="27      ">No more thy aukward unpoetic name</l>
<l ln="28      ">Should shun the Muse, or prejudice thy fame;</l>
<l ln="29      ">But rising grateful to the accustom'd ear,</l>
<l ln="30      ">All Bards should catch it, and all realms revere!</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="31      ">Assist me first with pious toil to trace</l>
<l ln="32      ">Thro' wrecks of time thy lineage and thy race;</l>
<l ln="33      ">Declare what lovely squaw, in days of yore,</l>
<l ln="34      ">(Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore)</l>
<l ln="35      ">First gave thee to the world; her works of fame</l>
<l ln="36      ">Have liv'd indeed, but liv'd without a name.</l>
<l ln="37      ">Some tawny Ceres, goddess of her days,</l>
<l ln="38      ">First learn'd with stones to crack the well&hyphen;dry'd maize,</l>
<l ln="39      ">Thro' the rough sieve to shake the golden show'r,</l>
<l ln="40      ">In boiling water stir the yellow flour.</l>
<l ln="41      ">The yellow flour, bestrew'd and stir'd with haste,</l>
<l ln="42      ">Swell in the flood and thickens to a paste,</l>
<pb n="3">
<l ln="43      ">Then puffs and wallops, rises to the brim,</l>
<l ln="44      ">Drinks the dry knobs that on the surface swim:</l>
<l ln="45      ">The knobs at last the busy ladle breaks,</l>
<l ln="46      ">And the whole mass its true consistence takes.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="47      ">Could but her sacred name, unknown so long,</l>
<l ln="48      ">Rise like her labors, to the sons of song,</l>
<l ln="49      ">To her, to them, I'd consecrate my lays,</l>
<l ln="50      ">And blow her pudding with the breath of praise.</l>
<l ln="51      ">If 'twas Oella, whom I sang before,</l>
<l ln="52      ">I here ascribe her one great virtue more.</l>
<l ln="53      ">Not thro' the rich Peruvian realms alone</l>
<l ln="54      ">The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known,</l>
<l ln="55      ">But o'er the world's wide climes should live secure,</l>
<l ln="56      ">Far as his rays extend, as long as they endure.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="57      ">Dear Hasty&hyphen;Pudding, what unpromis'd joy</l>
<l ln="58      ">Expands my heart, to meet thee in Savoy!</l>
<l ln="59      ">Doom'd o'er the world thro' devious paths to roam,</l>
<l ln="60      ">Each clime my country, and each house my home,</l>
<l ln="61      ">My soul is sooth'd, my cares have found an end,</l>
<l ln="62      ">I greet my long&hyphen;lost, unforgotten friend.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="63      ">For thee thro' Paris, that corrupted town,</l>
<l ln="64      ">How long in vain I wandered up and down,</l>
<l ln="65      ">Where shameless Bacchus, with his drenching hoard</l>
<l ln="66      ">Cold from his cave usurps the morning board.</l>
<l ln="67      ">London is lost in smoke and steep'd in tea;</l>
<l ln="68      ">No Yankey there can lisp the name of thee:</l>
<l ln="69      ">The uncouth word, a libel on the town,</l>
<l ln="70      ">Would call a proclamation from the crown. <edit>[Footnote: <bytes>1Kb</bytes>]</edit><note idref="AN000057">A certain king, at the time when this was written, was publishing proclamations to prevent American principles from being propagated in his country.</note></l>
<l ln="71      ">For climes oblique, that fear the sun's full rays,</l>
<l ln="72      ">Chill'd in their fogs, exclude the generous maize;</l>
<pb n="4">
<l ln="73      ">A grain whose rich luxuriant growth requires</l>
<l ln="74      ">Short gentle showers, and bright etherial fires.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="75      ">But here tho' distant from our native shore,</l>
<l ln="76      ">With mutual glee we meet and laugh once more,</l>
<l ln="77      ">The same! I know thee by that yellow face,</l>
<l ln="78      ">That strong complexion of true Indian race,</l>
<l ln="79      ">Which time can never change, nor soil impair,</l>
<l ln="80      ">Nor Alpine snows, nor Turkey's morbid air;</l>
<l ln="81      ">For endless years, thro' every mild domain,</l>
<l ln="82      ">Where grows the maize, there thou art sure to reign.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="83      ">But man, more fickle, the bold licence claims,</l>
<l ln="84      ">In different realms to give thee different names.</l>
<l ln="85      ">Thee the soft nations round the warm Levant</l>
<l ln="86      "><hi r="italic">Palanta</hi> call, the French of course <hi r="italic">Polante</hi>;</l>
<l ln="87      ">E'en in thy native regions, how I blush</l>
<l ln="88      ">To hear the Pennsylvanians call thee <hi r="italic">Mush</hi>!</l>
<l ln="89      ">On Hudson's banks, while men of Belgic spawn</l>
<l ln="90      ">Insult and eat thee by the name <hi r="italic">suppawn</hi>.</l>
<l ln="91      ">All spurious appellations, void of truth:</l>
<l ln="92      ">I've better known thee from my earliest youth,</l>
<l ln="93      ">Thy name is <hi r="italic">Hasty&hyphen;Pudding</hi>! thus our sires</l>
<l ln="94      ">Were wont to greet thee fuming from their fires;</l>
<l ln="95      ">And while they argu'd in thy just defence</l>
<l ln="96      ">With logic clear, they thus explained the sense:&mdash;</l>
<l ln="97      ">&ldquo;In <hi r="italic">haste</hi> the boiling cauldron o'er the blaze,</l>
<l ln="98      ">&ldquo;Receives and cooks the ready&hyphen;powder'd maize;</l>
<l ln="99      ">&ldquo;In <hi r="italic">haste</hi> 'tis serv'd, and then in equal <hi r="italic">haste</hi>,</l>
<l ln="100    ">&ldquo;With cooling milk, we make the sweet repast.</l>
<l ln="101    ">&ldquo;No carving to be done, no knife to grate</l>
<l ln="102    ">&ldquo;The tender ear, and wound the stony plate;</l>
<l ln="103    ">&ldquo;But the smooth spoon, just fitted to the lip,</l>
<l ln="104    ">&ldquo;And taught with art the yielding mass to dip,</l>
<l ln="105    ">&ldquo;By frequent journies to the bowl well stor'd,</l>
<l ln="106    ">&ldquo;Performs the hasty honors of the board.&rdquo;</l>
<pb n="5">
<l ln="107    ">Such is thy name, significant and clear,</l>
<l ln="108    ">A name, a sound to every Yankey dear,</l>
<l ln="109    ">But most to me, whose heart and palate chaste</l>
<l ln="110    ">Preserve my pure hereditary taste.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="111    ">There are who strive to stamp with disrepute</l>
<l ln="112    ">The luscious food, because it feeds the brute;</l>
<l ln="113    ">In tropes of high&hyphen;strain'd wit, while gaudy prigs</l>
<l ln="114    ">Compare thy nursling man to pamper'd pigs;</l>
<l ln="115    ">With sovereign scorn I treat the vulgar jest,</l>
<l ln="116    ">Nor fear to share thy bounties with the beast.</l>
<l ln="117    ">What though the generous cow gives me to quaff</l>
<l ln="118    ">The milk nutritious; am I then a calf?</l>
<l ln="119    ">Or can the genius of the noisy swine,</l>
<l ln="120    ">Tho' nurs'd on pudding, thence lay claim to mine?</l>
<l ln="121    ">Sure the sweet song, I fashion to thy praise,</l>
<l ln="122    ">Runs more melodious than the notes they raise.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="123    ">My song resounding in its grateful glee,</l>
<l ln="124    ">No merit claims; I praise myself in thee.</l>
<l ln="125    ">My father lov'd thee through his length of days:</l>
<l ln="126    ">For thee his fields were shaded o'er with maize;</l>
<l ln="127    ">From thee what health, what vigour he possest,</l>
<l ln="128    ">Ten sturdy freemen sprung from him attest;</l>
<l ln="129    ">Thy constellation rul'd my natal morn,</l>
<l ln="130    ">And all my bones were made of Indian corn.</l>
<l ln="131    ">Delicious grain! whatever form it take,</l>
<l ln="132    ">To roast or boil, to smother or to bake,</l>
<l ln="133    ">In every dish 'tis welcome still to me,</l>
<l ln="134    ">But most, my Hasty&hyphen;Pudding, most in thee.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="135    ">Let the green Succatash with thee contend,</l>
<l ln="136    ">Let beans and corn their sweetest juices blend,</l>
<l ln="137    ">Let butter drench them in its yellow tide,</l>
<l ln="138    ">And a long slice of bacon grace their side;</l>
<l ln="139    ">Not all the plate, how fam'd soe'er it be,</l>
<l ln="140    ">Can please my palate like a bowl of thee.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="6">
<pdiv><l ln="141    ">Some talk of Hoe&hyphen;cake, fair Virginia's pride,</l>
<l ln="142    ">Rich Johnny&hyphen;cake this mouth has often tri'd;</l>
<l ln="143    ">Both please me well, their virtues much the same;</l>
<l ln="144    ">Alike their fabric, as allied their fame,</l>
<l ln="145    ">Except in dear New&hyphen;England, where the last</l>
<l ln="146    ">Receives a dash of pumpkin in the paste,</l>
<l ln="147    ">To give it sweetness and improve the taste.</l>
<l ln="148    ">But place them all before me, smoaking hot,</l>
<l ln="149    ">The big round dumplin rolling from the pot;</l>
<l ln="150    ">The pudding of the bag, whose quivering breast,</l>
<l ln="151    ">With suet lin'd leads on the Yankey feast;</l>
<l ln="152    ">The Charlotte brown, within whose crusty sides</l>
<l ln="153    ">A belly soft the pulpy apple hides;</l>
<l ln="154    ">The yellow bread, whose face like amber glows,</l>
<l ln="155    ">And all of Indian that the bake&hyphen;pan knows&mdash;</l>
<l ln="156    ">You tempt me not&mdash;my fav'rite greets my eyes,</l>
<l ln="157    ">To that lov'd bowl my spoon by instinct flies.</l></pdiv></div3>

<pdiv><l ln="1        ">To mix the food by vicious rules of art,</l>

<l ln="3        ">To make mankind, to social virtue sour,</l>
<l ln="4        ">Cram o'er each dish, and be what they devour;</l>
<l ln="5        ">For this the kitchen Muse first framed her book,</l>
<l ln="6        ">Commanding sweats to stream from every cook;</l>
<l ln="7        ">Children no more their antic gambols tried,</l>
<l ln="8        ">And friends to physic wonder'd why they died.</l>
<l ln="9        ">Not so the Yankey&mdash;his abundant feast,</l>

<l ln="11      ">A numerous offspring gathers round the board,</l>
<l ln="12      ">And cheers alike the servant and the lord;</l>
<l ln="13      ">Whose well&hyphen;bought hunger prompts the joyous taste,</l>
<l ln="14      ">And health attends them from the short repast.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="7">
<pdiv><l ln="15      ">While the full pail rewards the milk&hyphen;maid's toil,</l>
<l ln="16      ">The mother sees the morning cauldron boil;</l>
<l ln="17      ">To stir the pudding next demands their care,</l>
<l ln="18      ">To spread the table and the bowls prepare;</l>
<l ln="19      ">To feed the children, as their portions cool,</l>
<l ln="20      ">And comb their heads, and send them off to school.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="21      ">Yet may the simplest dish, some rules impart,</l>
<l ln="22      ">For nature scorns not all the aids of art.</l>
<l ln="23      ">E'en Hasty&hyphen;Pudding, purest of all food,</l>
<l ln="24      ">May still be bad, indifferent, or good,</l>
<l ln="25      ">As sage experience the short process guides,</l>
<l ln="26      ">Or want of skill, or want of care presides.</l>
<l ln="27      ">Whoe'er would form it on the surest plan,</l>
<l ln="28      ">To rear the child and long sustain the man;</l>
<l ln="29      ">To shield the morals while it mends the size,</l>
<l ln="30      ">And all the powers of every food supplies,</l>
<l ln="31      ">Attend the lessons that the Muse shall bring,</l>
<l ln="32      ">Suspend your spoons, and listen while I sing.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="33      ">But since, O man! thy life and health demand</l>
<l ln="34      ">Not food alone, but labour from thy hand,</l>
<l ln="35      ">First in the field, beneath the sun's strong rays,</l>
<l ln="36      ">Ask of thy mother earth the needful maize;</l>
<l ln="37      ">She loves the race that courts her yielding soil,</l>
<l ln="38      ">And gives her bounties to the sons of toil.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="39      ">When now the ox, obedient to thy call,</l>
<l ln="40      ">Repays the loan that fill'd the winter stall,</l>
<l ln="41      ">Pursue his traces o'er the furrow'd plain,</l>
<l ln="42      ">And plant in measur'd hills the golden grain.</l>
<l ln="43      ">But when the tender germe begins to shoot,</l>
<l ln="44      ">And the green spire declares the sprouting root,</l>
<l ln="45      ">Then guard your nursling from each greedy foe,</l>
<l ln="46      ">Th'insidious worm, the all&hyphen;devouring crow.</l>
<l ln="47      ">A little ashes, sprinkled round the spire,</l>
<l ln="48      ">Soon steep'd in rain, will bid the worm retire;</l>
<pb n="8">
<l ln="49      ">The feather'd robber with his hungry maw</l>
<l ln="50      ">Swift flies the field before your man of straw,</l>
<l ln="51      ">A frightful image, such as school boys bring</l>
<l ln="52      ">When met to burn the Pope, or hang the King.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="53      ">Thrice in the season, through each verdant row</l>
<l ln="54      ">Wield the strong plough&hyphen;share and the faithful hoe;</l>

<pdiv><l ln="57      ">Slow springs the blade, while check'd by chilling rains,</l>
<l ln="58      ">Ere yet the sun the seat of Cancer gains;</l>
<l ln="59      ">But when his fiercest fires emblaze the land,</l>
<l ln="60      ">Then start the juices, then the roots expand;</l>
<l ln="61      ">Then, like a column of Corinthian mould,</l>
<l ln="62      ">The stalk struts upward, and the leaves unfold;</l>
<l ln="63      ">The bushy branches all the ridges fill,</l>
<l ln="64      ">Entwine their arms, and kiss from hill to hill.</l>
<l ln="65      ">Here cease to vex them, all your cares are done;</l>
<l ln="66      ">Leave the last labours to the parent sun;</l>
<l ln="67      ">Beneath his genial smiles the well&hyphen;drest field,</l>
<l ln="68      ">When autumn calls, a plenteous crop shall yield.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="69      ">Now the strong foliage bears the standards high,</l>
<l ln="70      ">And shoots the tall top&hyphen;gallants to the sky;</l>
<l ln="71      ">The suckling ears their silky fringes bend,</l>
<l ln="72      ">And pregnant grown, their swelling coats distend;</l>
<l ln="73      ">The loaded stalk, while still the burthen grows,</l>
<l ln="74      ">O'erhangs the space that runs between the rows;</l>
<l ln="75      ">High as a hop&hyphen;field waves the silent grove,</l>
<l ln="76      ">A safe retreat for little thefts of love,</l>
<l ln="77      ">When the pledg'd roasting&hyphen;ears invite the maid,</l>
<l ln="78      ">To meet her swain beneath the new&hyphen;form'd shade;</l>
<l ln="79      ">His generous hand unloads the cumbrous hill,</l>
<l ln="80      ">And the green spoils her ready basket fill;</l>
<l ln="81      ">Small compensation for the two&hyphen;fold bliss,</l>
<l ln="82      ">The promis'd wedding and the present kiss.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="9">
<pdiv><l ln="83      ">Slight depredations these; but now the moon</l>
<l ln="84      ">Calls from his hollow tree the sly raccoon;</l>
<l ln="85      ">And while by night he bears the prize away,</l>
<l ln="86      ">The bolder squirrel labours through the day.</l>
<l ln="87      ">Both thieves alike, but provident of time,</l>
<l ln="88      ">A virtue, rare, that almost hides their crime.</l>
<l ln="89      ">Then let them steal the little stores they can,</l>
<l ln="90      ">And fill their gran'ries from the toils of man;</l>
<l ln="91      ">We've one advantage where they take no part,&mdash;</l>
<l ln="92      ">With all their wiles they ne'er have found the art</l>

<l ln="100    ">The sack distended marches to the mill;</l>

<pdiv><l ln="1        ">THE days grow short; but tho' the falling sun</l>
<l ln="2        ">To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done,</l>
<l ln="3        ">Night's pleasing shades his various task prolong,</l>
<l ln="4        ">And yield new subjects to my various song.</l>
<l ln="5        ">For now, the corn&hyphen;house fill'd, the harvest home,</l>
<l ln="6        ">Th'invited neighbours to the <hi r="italic">Husking</hi> come;</l>
<l ln="7        ">A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play,</l>
<l ln="8        ">Unite their charms, to chace the hours away.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="10">
<pdiv><l ln="9        ">Where the huge heap lies center'd in the hall,</l>
<l ln="10      ">The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall,</l>
<l ln="11      ">Brown corn&hyphen;fed nymphs, and strong hard&hyphen;handed beaux,</l>
<l ln="12      ">Alternate rang'd, extend in circling rows,</l>
<l ln="13      ">Assume their seats, the solid mass attack;</l>
<l ln="14      ">The dry husks rustle, and the corn&hyphen;cobs crack;</l>
<l ln="15      ">The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound,</l>
<l ln="16      ">And the sweet cider trips in silence round.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="17      ">The laws of Husking ev'ry wight can tell;</l>
<l ln="18      ">And sure no laws he ever keeps so well:</l>
<l ln="19      ">For each red ear a general kiss he gains,</l>
<l ln="20      ">With each smut ear she smuts the luckless swains;</l>
<l ln="21      ">But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast,</l>
<l ln="22      ">Red as her lips, and taper as her waist,</l>
<l ln="23      ">She walks the round, and culls one favor'd beau,</l>
<l ln="24      ">Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow.</l>
<l ln="25      ">Various the sport, as are the wits and brains</l>
<l ln="26      ">Of well pleas'd lasses and contending swains:</l>
<l ln="27      ">Till the vast mound of corn is swept away,</l>
<l ln="28      ">And he that gets the last ear, wins the day.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="29      ">Meanwhile the house&hyphen;wife urges all her care,</l>
<l ln="30      ">The well&hyphen;earn'd feast to hasten and prepare.</l>
<l ln="31      ">The sifted meal already waits her hand,</l>
<l ln="32      ">The milk is strain'd the bowls in order stand,</l>
<l ln="33      ">The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes</l>
<l ln="34      ">The headlong stream that o'er the mill&hyphen;dam breaks)</l>
<l ln="35      ">Foams, roars and rages with incessant toils,</l>
<l ln="36      ">So the vext cauldron rages, roars and boils.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="37      ">First with clean salt she seasons well the food,</l>
<l ln="38      ">Then strews the flour and thickens all the flood.</l>
<l ln="39      ">Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand:</l>
<l ln="40      ">To stir it well demands a stronger hand;</l>
<l ln="41      ">The husband takes his turn; and round and round</l>
<l ln="42      ">The ladle flies; at last the toil is crown'd;</l>
<pb n="11">
<l ln="43      ">When to the board the thronging huskers pour,</l>
<l ln="44      ">And take their seats as at the corn before.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="45      ">I leave them to their feast. There still belong</l>
<l ln="46      ">More copious matters to my faithful song.</l>
<l ln="47      ">For rules there are, tho' ne'er unfolded yet,</l>
<l ln="48      ">Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="49      ">Some with molasses line the luscious treat,</l>
<l ln="50      ">And mix, like Bards, the useful with the sweet.</l>
<l ln="51      ">A wholesome dish, and well&hyphen;deserving praise,</l>
<l ln="52      ">A great resource in those bleak wintry days,</l>
<l ln="53      ">When the chill'd earth lies buried deep in snow,</l>
<l ln="54      ">And raging Boreas drives the shivering cow.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="55      ">Blest cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ,</l>
<l ln="56      ">Great source of health, the only source of joy;</l>
<l ln="57      ">How oft thy teats these pious hands have prest!</l>
<l ln="58      ">How oft thy bounties prove my only feast!</l>
<l ln="59      ">How oft I've fed thee with my fav'rite grain!</l>
<l ln="60      ">And roar'd, like thee, to find thy children slain!</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="61      ">Ye swains who know her various worth to prize,</l>
<l ln="62      ">Ah! house her well from Winter's angry skies.</l>
<l ln="63      ">Potatoes, Pumpkins, should her sadness cheer,</l>
<l ln="64      ">Corn from your crib, and mashes from your beer;</l>
<l ln="65      ">When Spring returns she'll well acquit the loan,</l>
<l ln="66      ">And nurse at once your infants and her own.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="67      ">Milk then with pudding I should always chuse;</l>
<l ln="68      ">To this in future I confine my Muse,</l>
<l ln="69      ">Till she in haste some farther hints unfold,</l>
<l ln="70      ">Well for the young, nor useless to the old.</l>
<l ln="71      ">First in your bowl the milk abundant take,</l>
<l ln="72      ">Then drop with care along the silver lake</l>
<l ln="73      ">Your flakes of pudding; these at first will hide</l>
<l ln="74      ">Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide;</l>
<l ln="75      ">But when their growing mass no more can sink,</l>
<l ln="76      ">When the soft island looms above the brink,</l>
<pb n="12">
<l ln="77      ">Then check your hand: you've got the portion's due,</l>
<l ln="78      ">So taught our sires, and what they taught is true.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="79      ">There is a choice in spoons. Tho' small appear</l>
<l ln="80      ">The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear,</l>
<l ln="81      ">The deep bowl'd Gallic spoon, contriv'd to scoop</l>
<l ln="82      ">In ample draughts the thin diluted soup,</l>
<l ln="83      ">Performs not well in those substantial things,</l>
<l ln="84      ">Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings;</l>
<l ln="85      ">Where the strong labial muscles must embrace,</l>
<l ln="86      ">The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space.</l>
<l ln="87      ">With ease to enter and discharge the freight,</l>
<l ln="88      ">A bowl less concave but still more dilate,</l>
<l ln="89      ">Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size,</l>
<l ln="90      ">A secret rests unknown to vulgar eyes.</l>
<l ln="91      ">Experienc'd feeders can alone impart</l>
<l ln="92      ">A rule so much above the lore of art.</l>
<l ln="93      ">These tuneful lips, that thousand spoons have tried,</l>
<l ln="94      ">With just precision could the point decide,</l>
<l ln="95      ">Tho' not in song; the muse but poorly shines</l>
<l ln="96      ">In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines.</l>
<l ln="97      ">Yet the true form, as near as she can tell,</l>
<l ln="98      ">Is that small section of a goose&hyphen;egg&hyphen;shell,</l>
<l ln="99      ">Which in two equal portions shall divide</l>
<l ln="100    ">The distance from the centre to the side.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="101    ">Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin,</l>
<l ln="102    ">Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin</l>
<l ln="103    ">Suspend the ready napkin; or, like me,</l>
<l ln="104    ">Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee;</l>
<l ln="105    ">Just in the zenith your wise head project,</l>
<l ln="106    ">Your full spoon, rising in a line direct,</l>
<l ln="107    ">Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall,</l>
<l ln="108    ">The wide mouth'd bowl will surely catch them all.</l></pdiv></div3></poem>

<l ln="2        ">Hath circled heaven and bid the day appear,</l>
<l ln="3        ">That opes thy portals, gilds thy spiry dome,</l>
<l ln="4        ">And calls thy children from their joyous home.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="5        ">Thro' seven long years hath war's terrific power</l>
<l ln="6        ">Rang'd every town and crimson'd every shore,</l>
<l ln="7        ">Pursu'd fair Science from each happy seat,</l>
<l ln="8        ">Rav'd in her domes and forc'd her last retreat,</l>
<l ln="9        ">And oft, Yalensia, doom'd thy final fall,</l>
<l ln="10      ">While thy sad Genius trembled for thy wall.</l>
<l ln="11      ">Now see, at last, the venerable train,</l>
<l ln="12      ">Thine elder sons ascend thy courts again!</l>
<l ln="13      ">We joy the reverend, happy throng to see,</l>
<l ln="14      ">We wake thy own blest Muse, and bid her sing to thee.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="15      ">Long have we liv'd beneath thy nurturing care,</l>
<l ln="16      ">And joy and friendship crown'd our labors there;</l>
<l ln="17      ">No more within those blissful haunts we dwell,</l>
<l ln="18      ">To all thy train we bid a long farewel;</l>
<l ln="19      ">One gentle grasp, one silent, sorrowing tear,</l>
<l ln="20      ">And joys and friends forever disappear;</l>
<l ln="21      ">Fate calls us hence the world's broad stage to tread,</l>
<l ln="22      ">Act a short part, and mingle with the dead.</l>
<l ln="23      ">We go&mdash;but may thy glory still ascend,</l>
<l ln="24      ">Thy fame, thy virtues thro' the world extend;</l>
<l ln="25      ">Thy future sons, a calm, delightful throng,</l>
<l ln="26      ">As following years shall lead their steps along,</l>

<l ln="27      ">To peace, to happiness, to glory rise,</l>
<l ln="28      ">Shine thro' the earth and brighten in the skies.</l>
<l ln="29      ">No ruffian force that treads the distant shore,</l>
<l ln="30      ">Shall dare invade thy peaceful labors more;</l>
<l ln="31      ">While the proud foes beneath our standards yield,</l>
<l ln="32      ">And our brave brethren claim the crimson field,</l>
<l ln="33      ">Within thy courts shall pride and slaughter cease,</l>
<l ln="34      ">And genius dignify the walks of peace.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="35      ">And oh! may some blest hand regard thy cries,</l>
<l ln="36      ">Some great, some liberal benefactor rise,</l>
<l ln="37      ">Whose soul awakes at thy inspiring call,</l>
<l ln="38      ">To lift thy spires, enlarge thy scanty wall,</l>
<l ln="39      ">Who joys to aid the Muse's feeble voice,</l>
<l ln="40      ">And bid bright learning in her sons rejoice,</l>
<l ln="41      ">Bid wealth and dignity thy steps attend,</l>
<l ln="42      ">And rival arts and rival virtues blend,</l>
<l ln="43      ">O'er all the happy land thy beauties shine,</l>
<l ln="44      ">And every joy, and every wish be thine.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="45      ">Ye patriot worthies, whom these strains assail,</l>
<l ln="46      ">Ye Reverend Sires, and all ye sons of Yale,</l>
<l ln="47      ">Behold our seat, by former bounty given,</l>
<l ln="48      ">Pride of our land and favorite child of heaven,</l>
<l ln="49      ">Whence liberal arts and liberal thoughts ye drew,</l>
<l ln="50      ">When few her children and her wants were few;</l>
<l ln="51      ">Now see, the narrow bounds can scarce contain</l>
<l ln="52      ">Half the throng'd numbers of her joyous train,</l>
<l ln="53      ">While every friend averts th'unconscious eye,</l>
<l ln="54      ">And power, and interest pass unheeding by.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="5">
<pdiv><l ln="55      ">As late, when war's grim terrors sought repose,</l>
<l ln="56      ">And evening mists and distant fires arose,</l>
<l ln="57      ">Far in a gloomy grove I pensive stray'd,</l>
<l ln="58      ">Where death's pale phantoms walk'd the midnight shade,</l>
<l ln="59      ">Thin clouds of sickening damps, o'er ether driven,</l>
<l ln="60      ">Obscur'd the stars and shut the eye from heaven;</l>
<l ln="61      ">Unwonted sighs within my bosom rose,</l>
<l ln="62      ">Cities o'erturn'd and all my country's woes</l>
<l ln="63      ">Pour'd on my heart; but chief thy feeble cries,</l>
<l ln="64      ">Neglected Science, bade my griefs arise.</l>
<l ln="65      ">I saw, from Briton's Isle, thy genius flown,</l>
<l ln="66      ">In these fair climes to fix a nobler throne,</l>
<l ln="67      ">While here thy sons the peaceful myrtle yield,</l>
<l ln="68      ">To pluck the crimson laurel of the field.</l>
<l ln="69      ">I saw thy seats to scenes of slaughter turn'd,</l>
<l ln="70      ">Thy walls defac'd, thy fairest labours burn'd;</l>
<l ln="71      ">E'en Yale, thy loveliest handmaid, now no more,</l>
<l ln="72      ">Knew the gay smiles of youth she knew before,</l>
<l ln="73      ">Her funds decreas'd, her strength, her int'rest fled,</l>
<l ln="74      ">Her friends neglectful, and her <hi r="italic">Hosmer</hi> dead.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="75      ">Now a calm splendor burst the saddening gloom,</l>
<l ln="76      ">And gales etherial breath'd a glad perfume,</l>
<l ln="77      ">Mild in the midst a form celestial shone,</l>
<l ln="78      ">Rob'd in the vestments of the rising sun;</l>
<l ln="79      ">Tall rose his stature, dignity and grace</l>
<l ln="80      ">Mov'd in his limbs and wanton'd in his face,</l>
<l ln="81      ">His folding mantle flow'd in easy pride,</l>
<l ln="82      ">His harp divine lay useless by his side,</l>
<pb n="6">
<l ln="83      ">His locks in curls from myrtle chaplets hung</l>
<l ln="84      ">And sounds melodious melted from his tongue.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="85      ">&ldquo;Mortal, attend, behold before thee stand</l>
<l ln="86      ">Learning's bright Genius, guardian of the land;</l>
<l ln="87      ">Let grief no more awake the piteous strain,</l>

<l ln="89      ">Awhile my skill must guide the wild affray,</l>
<l ln="90      ">Range the red field and sweep thy foes away,</l>
<l ln="91      ">Soon shall this arm a milder sceptre bear,</l>

<l ln="105    ">Say tis for them to stretch the liberal hand,</l>
<l ln="106    ">While war's dread tumults yet involve the land,</l>
<l ln="107    ">Sustain her drooping, rear her radiant eyes,</l>
<l ln="108    ">And bid her future fame begin to rise.</l>
<l ln="109    ">Tell them the wild commotions soon shall cease,</l>

<l ln="111    ">Where rest the future deeds on earth design'd</l>
<l ln="112    ">To raise, to dignify and bless mankind.</l></pdiv>

<l ln="117    ">And here, what roving views before them spread!</l>
<l ln="118    ">Where this new empire lifts her daring head!</l>
<l ln="119    ">What wide extent her waving ensigns claim!</l>
<l ln="120    ">Lands yet unknown and streams without a name.</l>
<l ln="121    ">Where the deep gulph unfolds Floridia's shore,</l>
<l ln="122    ">To where Ontario bids hoarse Laurence roar;</l>
<l ln="123    ">Where Missisippi's waves their sources boast,</l>
<l ln="124    ">Where groves and floods and realms and climes are lost,</l>
<l ln="125    ">To where the mild Atlantic's length'ning tide,</l>
<l ln="126    ">Laves numerous towns, and swells their naval pride.</l>
<l ln="127    ">And see! by nature's hand o'er all bestow'd,</l>
<l ln="128    ">The last pure polish of the forming God.</l>
<l ln="129    ">What various grandeur strikes the gladdening eyes!</l>
<l ln="130    ">Bays stretch their arms and mountains lift the skies;</l>
<l ln="131    ">The lakes, unfolding, point the streams their way,</l>
<l ln="132    ">The plains, the hills their lengthening skirts display,</l>
<l ln="133    ">The vales draw forth, fair wave the glimmering wilds,</l>
<l ln="134    ">And all the majesty of nature smiles.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="135    ">On this broad theatre, unbounded spread,</l>
<l ln="136    ">In different scenes, what countless throngs must tread.</l>
<l ln="137    ">Soon as the new form'd empire, rising fair,</l>
<l ln="138    ">Calms her brave sons now breathing from the war.</l>
<pb n="8">
<l ln="139    ">Unfolds her harbours, spreads the genial soil,</l>

<l ln="142    ">What numerous bards must tell the world her fame!</l>
<l ln="143    ">What numerous chiefs beneath my forming care,</l>
<l ln="144    ">Must blaze in arms and ward the waste of war!</l>
<l ln="145    ">While every art and all the graces meet,</l>
<l ln="146    ">To form her thousands to the cares of State,</l>
<l ln="147    ">To heal pale sickness, bid diseases cease,</l>
<l ln="148    ">And sound the tidings of eternal peace.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="149    ">Those must arise the present age to lead,</l>
<l ln="150    ">And following millions hail the paths they tread.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="151    ">Such gladdening views will ope the bounteous store</l>
<l ln="152    ">The grasp of interest and the pride of power,</l>
<l ln="153    ">Yalensia's friends shall thus attend her call,</l>
<l ln="154    ">And youths unnumber'd bless the favorite wall.</l></pdiv>

<l ln="170    ">Link in the chain and harmonize mankind,</l>

<pdiv><l ln="173    ">Already now commencing glories rise,</l>
<l ln="174    ">The work begins beneath yon northern skies;</l>
<l ln="175    ">The Russian forests to the deep advance,</l>
<l ln="176    ">The ports unfold, the glimmering navies dance,</l>
<l ln="177    ">For commerce arm'd, the different powers combine,</l>
<l ln="178    ">And heaven approving aids the blest design.</l>
<l ln="179    ">Tho' rival regions still the combat wage,</l>
<l ln="180    ">And hold in bickering strife the unsettled age,</l>
<l ln="181    ">Yet no rude war, that sweeps the crimson plain,</l>
<l ln="182    ">Shall dare disturb the labors of the main;</l>
<l ln="183    ">For heaven, impartial to the earth born race,</l>
<l ln="184    ">Bade one broad circling deep their shores embrace,</l>
<l ln="185    ">Spread to all realms the same wide, watry way</l>
<l ln="186    ">Liberal as air and unconfin'd as day,</l>

<pdiv><l ln="193    ">We then beheld, 'till where in lonely pride,</l>

<pb n="10">
<l ln="195    ">At once in gathering squadrons, from the north,</l>
<l ln="196    ">The mingling streamers lead the nations forth;</l>
<l ln="197    ">From different shores unnumber'd masts arise,</l>
<l ln="198    ">And wave their peaceful curtains to the skies;</l>
<l ln="199    ">Broader and broader still the wings unfold,</l>
<l ln="200    ">All Europe's coasts the streaming pomp behold,</l>
<l ln="201    ">From Gallia's ports, from Albion's hoary height,</l>
<l ln="202    ">United flags are pointed into sight;</l>
<l ln="203    ">Where broad Hispania's strand two oceans lave,</l>
<l ln="204    ">And the rich Tagus mingles with the wave,</l>
<l ln="205    ">The countless navies lift their banners wide,</l>
<l ln="206    ">And stream their glories o'er the foamy tide;</l>
<l ln="207    ">While thro' the glimmering Strait, in long array;</l>
<l ln="208    ">Pour'd from the fleets that croud the midland sea,</l>
<l ln="209    ">The sails look forth and swell their beauteous pride,</l>
<l ln="210    ">With wider waves and bolder barks to glide;</l>
<l ln="211    ">While far, far distant, where the watry way</l>
<l ln="212    ">Spreads the blue borders of descending day,</l>
<l ln="213    ">The misty sails advance in lengthening sweep,</l>
<l ln="214    ">Pride of the western world and daughters of the deep,</l>

<l ln="216    ">While to our view the crouded squadrons heave,</l>
<l ln="217    ">In sign of union, each advancing line,</l>
<l ln="218    ">Leads a calm nation, bids their banners join,</l>
<l ln="219    ">Till far as pole from pole, the cloudlike train</l>
<l ln="220    ">Skirts the dim heavens and shades the whitening main.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="221    ">We saw, in other seas and other skies,</l>
<l ln="222    ">With equal pomp unnumber'd streamers rise;</l>
<pb n="11">
<l ln="223    ">Where Asia's isles and utmost shores extend,</l>

<l ln="228    ">No more to combat on the watry plain.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="229    ">We saw new barks to new discoveries roll,</l>
<l ln="230    ">Where unknown waves salute each distant pole;</l>
<l ln="231    ">Far in the north, where seas Pacific pour,</l>
<l ln="232    ">And ope Columbia from the Asian shore,</l>
<l ln="233    ">The daring sails th'unmeasur'd flight pursue,</l>
<l ln="234    ">And isles and countless nations rise to view.</l>
<l ln="235    ">While some bold Sage, Columbus like, design'd</l>
<l ln="236    ">By other stars and waves to lead mankind,</l>
<l ln="237    ">With conscious pride and philosophic eye,</l>
<l ln="238    ">Treads the lone borders of the southern sky,</l>
<l ln="239    ">With persevering toil the deeps explores,</l>
<l ln="240    ">Till there a new found world extends her length'ning shores</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="241    ">We saw, from each new realm, new arts ascend,</l>

<pdiv><l ln="247    ">Such views around us spread, when thus the guide,</l>
<l ln="248    ">&ldquo;These are my works that load the sweeping tide;</l>

<l ln="254    ">To rage alone and scenes of blood inur'd,</l>
<l ln="255    ">To teach the lance to thirst for human gore,</l>

<l ln="258    ">Teach her own muse the clangor of the field,</l>

<l ln="271    ">That leads the hours of calm domestic toil,</l>
<l ln="272    ">And cheers the houshold with an evening smile,</l>

<pdiv><l ln="297    ">Thus different arts their kindred cares employ,</l>

<l ln="302    ">When the tall pillars of the dome ascend,</l>

<l ln="304    ">And full proportion meets the roving eye.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="305    ">Or when the garden to the impassion'd heart,</l>

<l ln="320    ">To rouse the sceptred marble into life,</l>
<l ln="321    ">While fairer hands the livelier fire controul,</l>
<l ln="322    ">And into softer figures shed the soul.</l>
<l ln="323    ">In hearts attun'd the voice of music dwells,</l>
<l ln="324    ">Steals o'er the lip and into passion swells,</l>
<l ln="325    ">Swept by th'alternate hand the living lyre,</l>

<l ln="327    ">Till all the magic melody of sound,</l>

<pdiv><l ln="329    ">And when the breath of heaven from Angel quires,</l>

<pb n="15">
<l ln="335    ">No more of vengeful chiefs and bickering Gods,</l>
<l ln="336    ">Where ocean crimsons and Olympus nods,</l>
<l ln="337    ">Or heavens, convulsing rend the dark profound,</l>
<l ln="338    ">To chain fierce Titans to the groaning ground,</l>
<l ln="339    ">But, fir'd by milder themes, and charms refin'd,</l>
<l ln="340    ">Beam'd from the beauties of the fair one's mind,</l>
<l ln="341    ">His soul awakes the peace inspiring song,</l>
<l ln="342    ">And life and happiness the strain prolong.</l>
<l ln="343    ">To moral beauties bids the world attend,</l>
<l ln="344    ">And jarring realms in social compact blend;</l>
<l ln="345    ">Bids laws extend and commerce stretch the wing,</l>
<l ln="346    ">Far distant shores their barter'd tributes bring;</l>
<l ln="347    ">He sees the nations join, their bliss increase,</l>
<l ln="348    ">(Leagu'd in his lays) and sings them into peace.</l>
<l ln="349    ">While pleas'd, the Muse divides her equal care,</l>
<l ln="350    ">And the same ardor warms the listening fair;</l>
<l ln="351    ">From his pure breath she lights a bolder flame,</l>
<l ln="352    ">The same her genius and her slight the same,</l>
<l ln="353    ">In mutual smiles the borrow'd graces play,</l>
<l ln="354    ">In mutual sweetness slide the hours away,</l>
<l ln="355    ">In mutual aid the borrow'd numbers roll,</l>
<l ln="356    ">And swell'd to rapture breathes the mutual soul.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="357    ">From their own loves, thus soften'd and refin'd,</l>
<l ln="358    ">The general wish extends to all mankind,</l>
<l ln="359    ">The neighbour's cares, the family, the friend</l>
<l ln="360    ">Pour on the heart, and in the bosom blend;</l>
<l ln="361    ">The poor, the stranger find a welcome home,</l>
<l ln="362    ">The vagrant foot is pointed where to roam,</l>
<pb n="16">
<l ln="363    ">The eye of anguish, when no help is near,</l>
<l ln="364    ">Looks the fond wish and finds the mingling tear.</l>
<l ln="365    ">E'en to their foes their equal goodness bends,</l>
<l ln="366    ">And hostile minds are soften'd into friends.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="367    ">And when their lays have pour'd the bounteous mind,</l>
<l ln="368    ">In warm benevolence, to all their kind,</l>
<l ln="369    ">They lift the bolder note, the raptures glow,</l>
<l ln="370    ">To loves pure source whence all her streamlets flow.</l>
<l ln="371    ">Rapt into vision of the bright abode,</l>
<l ln="372    ">From angel harps they catch th'inspiring God;</l>
<l ln="373    ">Thro' heavens, o'er&hyphen;canopy'd by heavens, they soar,</l>
<l ln="374    ">Where floods of light in boundless beauty pour,</l>
<l ln="375    ">Seraphs and system'd worlds innumerous move,</l>
<l ln="376    ">Link'd in the chain of harmonizing love;</l>
<l ln="377    ">Thence following down, th'effulgent glory trace,</l>
<l ln="378    ">Which brought salvation to their kindred race.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="379    ">Thus, on the stream of life, with gentle sweep,</l>
<l ln="380    ">They roll delightful to the welcome deep,</l>
<l ln="381    ">Where, unconfin'd, their spirits gently sail,</l>
<l ln="382    ">View happier climes and taste a purer gale;</l>
<l ln="383    ">Thro' ether's boundless realms together rise,</l>
<l ln="384    ">And claim their kindred mansions in the skies;</l>
<l ln="385    ">There fill the rapture of th'adoring throng,</l>
<l ln="386    ">Whose lays on earth prelude the heavenly song.&rdquo;</l></pdiv></poem>

<firstl><l ln="1        ">Black fool, why winter here? These frozen skies,</l></firstl>
<l ln="2        ">Worn by your wings and deafened by your cries,</l>
<pb n="398">
<l ln="3        ">Should warn you hence, where milder suns invite,</l>
<l ln="4        ">And Day alternates with his mother Night.</l>
<l ln="5        ">You fear, perhaps, your food will fail you there&mdash;</l>
<l ln="6        ">Your human carnage, that delicious fare,</l>
<l ln="7        ">That lured you hither, following still your friend,</l>
<l ln="8        ">The great Napoleon, to the world's bleak end.</l>
<l ln="9        ">You fear because the southern climes pour'd forth</l>
<l ln="10      ">Their clustering nations to infest the north&mdash;</l>
<l ln="11      ">Bavarians, Austrians&mdash;those who drink the Po,</l>
<l ln="12      ">And those who skirt the Tuscan seas below,</l>
<l ln="13      ">With all Germania, Neustria, Belgia, Gaul,</l>
<l ln="14      ">Doom'd here to wade through slaughter to their fall.</l>
<l ln="15      ">You fear he left behind no wars to feed</l>
<l ln="16      ">His feather'd cannibals and nurse the breed.</l>
<l ln="17      ">Fear not, my screamer, call your greedy train,</l>
<l ln="18      ">Sweep over Europe, hurry back to Spain&mdash;</l>
<l ln="19      ">You'll find his legions there, the valiant crew,</l>
<l ln="20      ">Please best their masters when they toil for you.</l>
<l ln="21      ">Abundant there they spread the country o'er,</l>
<l ln="22      ">And taint the breeze with every nation's gore&mdash;</l>
<l ln="23      ">Iberian, Russian, British, widely strown,</l>
<l ln="24      ">But still more wide and copious flows their own.</l>
<l ln="25      ">Go where you will, Calabria, Malta, Greece,</l>
<l ln="26      ">Egypt and Syria still his fame increase.</l>
<l ln="27      ">Domingo's fattened isle and India's plains</l>
<l ln="28      ">Glow deep with purple drawn from Gallic veins.</l>
<l ln="29      ">No raven's wing can stretch the flight so far</l>
<l ln="30      ">As the torn bandrols of Napoleon's war.</l>
<l ln="31      ">Choose then your climate, fix your best abode&mdash;</l>
<l ln="32      ">He'll make you deserts and he'll bring you blood.</l>
<l ln="33      ">How could you fear a dearth? Have not mankind,</l>
<l ln="34      ">Though slain by millions, millions left behind?</l>
<l ln="35      ">Has not conscription still the power to wield</l>
<l ln="36      ">Her annual falchion o'er the human field?</l>
<l ln="37      ">A faithful harvester! or if a man</l>
<l ln="38      ">Escape that gleaner, shall he 'scape the ban,</l>
<l ln="39      ">The triple ban, that, like the hound of hell,</l>
<l ln="40      ">Gripes with three joles to hold his victims well!</l>
<l ln="41      ">Fear nothing, then! hatch fast your ravenous brood,</l>
<l ln="42      ">Teach them to cry to Buonaparte for food.</l>
<l ln="43      ">They'll be, like you, of all his suppliant train,</l>
<l ln="44      ">The only class that never cries in vain!</l>
<l ln="45      ">For see what natural benefits you lend&mdash;</l>
<l ln="46      ">The surest way to fix the mutual friend&mdash;</l>
<l ln="47      ">While on his slaughtered troops your tribes are fed,</l>
<l ln="48      ">You cleanse his camp and carry off his dead,</l>
<l ln="49      ">Imperial scavenger, but now, you know,</l>
<l ln="50      ">Your work is vain amid these hills of snow.</l>
<l ln="51      ">His tentless troops are marbled through with frost,</l>
<l ln="52      ">And changed to crystal when the breath is lost.</l>
<l ln="53      ">Mere trunks of ice, though limn'd like human frames,</l>
<l ln="54      ">And lately warmed with life's endearing flames,</l>
<l ln="55      ">They cannot taint the air, the world infest,</l>
<l ln="56      ">Nor can you tear one fibre from their breast.</l>
<l ln="57      ">No! from their visual sockets as they lie,</l>
<l ln="58      ">With beak and claws you cannot pluck an eye&mdash;</l>
<l ln="59      ">The frozen orb, preserving still its form,</l>
<l ln="60      ">Defies your talons as it braves the storm,</l>
<l ln="61      ">But stands and stares to God as if to know,</l>
<l ln="62      ">In what curst hands he leaves his world below!</l>
<l ln="63      ">Fly then, or starve, though all the dreadful road</l>
<l ln="64      ">From Minsk to Moscow with their bodies strow'd</l>
<l ln="65      ">May count some myriads, yet they can't suffice</l>
<l ln="66      ">To feed you more beneath these dreadful skies.</l>
<l ln="67      ">Go back and winter in the wilds of Spain;</l>
<l ln="68      ">Feast there awhile, and in the next campaign</l>
<l ln="69      ">Rejoin your master, for you'll find him then,</l>
<l ln="70      ">With his new millions of the race of men,</l>
<l ln="71      ">Clothed in his thunders, all his flags unfurl'd,</l>
<l ln="72      ">Raging and storming o'er a prostrate world!</l>
<l ln="73      ">War after war his hungry soul requires;</l>
<l ln="74      ">State after state shall sink beneath his fires.</l>
<l ln="75      ">Yet other Spains in victim smoke shall rise.</l>
<l ln="76      ">And other Moscows suffocate the skies.</l>
<l ln="77      ">Each land lie reeking with its people slain,</l>
<l ln="78      ">And not a stream run bloodless to the main,</l>
<l ln="79      ">Till men resume their souls, and dare to shed</l>
<l ln="80      ">Earth's total vengeance on the monster's head!</l></poem>

<l ln="60      ">The woodland shout the joyous ear assails;</l>
<l ln="61      ">Industrious crouds in different labors toil,</l>
<l ln="62      ">Those ply the arts, and these improve the soil.</l>
<l ln="63      ">Here the fond merchant counts his rising gain,</l>
<l ln="64      ">There strides the rustic o'er the furrow'd plain,</l>
<l ln="65      ">Here walks the statesman, pensive and serene,</l>
<l ln="66      ">And there the school boys gambol round the green.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="67      ">See ripening harvests gild the smiling plains,</l>
<l ln="68      ">Kind Nature's bounty and the pride of swains;</l>
<l ln="69      ">Luxuriant vines their curling tendrils shoot,</l>
<l ln="70      ">And bow their heads to drop the clustering fruit;</l>
<l ln="71      ">In the gay fields, with rich profusion strow'd,</l>
<l ln="72      ">The orchard bends beneath its yellow load,</l>
<pb n="6">
<l ln="73      ">The lofty boughs their annual burden pour,</l>
<l ln="74      ">And juicy harvests swell th'autumnal store.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="75      ">These are the blessings of impartial Heaven,</l>
<l ln="76      ">To each fond heart in just proportion given.</l>
<l ln="77      ">No grasping lord shall grind the neighbouring poor,</l>
<l ln="78      ">Starve numerous vassals to increase his store;</l>
<l ln="79      ">No cringing slave shall at his presence bend,</l>
<l ln="80      ">Shrink at his frown, and at his nod attend;</l>
<l ln="81      ">Afric's unhappy children, now no more</l>
<l ln="82      ">Shall feel the cruel chains they felt before,</l>
<l ln="83      ">But every State in this just mean agree,</l>
<l ln="84      ">To bless mankind, and set th'oppressed free.</l>
<l ln="85      ">Then, rapt in transport, each exulting slave</l>
<l ln="86      ">Shall taste that Boon which God and nature gave,</l>
<l ln="87      ">And, fir'd with virtue, join the common cause,</l>
<l ln="88      ">Protect our freedom and enjoy our laws.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="89      ">At this calm period, see, in pleasing view,</l>
<l ln="90      ">Art vies with Art, and Nature smiles anew:</l>
<l ln="91      ">On the long, winding strand that meets the tide,</l>
<l ln="92      ">Unnumber'd cities lift their spiry pride;</l>
<l ln="93      ">Gay, flowery walks salute th'inraptur'd eyes,</l>
<l ln="94      ">Tall, beauteous domes in dazzling prospect rise;</l>
<l ln="95      ">There thronging navies stretch their wanton sails,</l>

<l ln="98      ">And wafts in plenty to the smiling store.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="7">
<pdiv><l ln="99      ">To these throng'd seats the country wide resorts,</l>

<l ln="101    ">While, far remote, gay health and pleasure flow,</l>
<l ln="102    ">And calm retirement cheers the laboring brow.</l>
<l ln="103    ">No din of arms the peaceful patriot hears,</l>
<l ln="104    ">No parting sigh tender matron fears,</l>
<l ln="105    ">No field of fame invites the youth to rove,</l>
<l ln="106    ">Nor virgins know a harsher sound than love.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="107    ">Fair Science then her laurel'd beauty rears,</l>
<l ln="108    ">And soars with Genius to the radiant stars.</l>
<l ln="109    ">Her glimmering dawn from Gothic darkness rose,</l>
<l ln="110    ">And nations saw her shadowy veil disclose;</l>
<l ln="111    ">She cheer'd fair Europe with her rising smiles,</l>
<l ln="112    ">Beam'd a bright morning o'er the British isles,</l>

<l ln="114    ">And blest Columbia hails the dazzling light!</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="115    ">Here, rapt in tho't, the philosophic soul</l>
<l ln="116    ">Shall look thro' Nature's parts and grasp the whole.</l>
<l ln="117    ">See Genius kindling at a <hi r="smcap">Franklin</hi>'s fame,</l>
<l ln="118    ">See unborn sages catch th'electric flame,</l>

<pdiv><l ln="121    ">See the pleas'd youth, with anxious study, rove,</l>

<l ln="123    ">No more perplex'd, while <hi r="smcap">Rittenhouse</hi> appears</l>
<l ln="124    ">To grace the museum with the rolling spheres.</l></pdiv>
<pb n="8">

<l ln="128    ">To blast the watery world &amp; guard the peaceful shore.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="129    ">And where's the rising Sage, the unknown name,</l>

<l ln="131    ">To find the cause, in secret nature bound,</l>
<l ln="132    ">The unknown cause, and various charms of sound?</l>
<l ln="133    ">What subtil medium leads the devious way;</l>
<l ln="134    ">Why different tensions different sounds convey;</l>
<l ln="135    ">Why harsh, rough tones in grating discord roll,</l>
<l ln="136    ">Or mingling concert charms th'enraptur'd soul.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="137    ">And tell the cause why sluggish vapors rise,</l>
<l ln="138    ">And wave, exalted, thro' the genial skies;</l>
<l ln="139    ">What strange contrivance nature forms to bear</l>
<l ln="140    ">The ponderous burden thro' the lighter air.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="141    ">These last Displays the curious mind engage,</l>
<l ln="142    ">And fire the genius of the rising age;</l>
<l ln="143    ">While moral tho'ts the pleas'd attention claim,</l>
<l ln="144    ">Swell the warm soul, and wake the virtuous flame;</l>
<l ln="145    ">While Metaphysics soar a boundless height,</l>
<l ln="146    ">And launch with <hi r="smcap">Edwards</hi> to the realms of light.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="147    ">See the blest Muses hail their roseate bowers,</l>
<l ln="148    ">Their mansions blooming with poetic flowers;</l>
<l ln="149    ">See listening Seraphs join the epic throng,</l>

<l ln="164    ">The radiant charms that deck the blushing face;</l>
<l ln="165    ">But rising Beauties scorn the tinsel show,</l>

<caption>TO HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY, LOUIS THE <hi r="smcap">Sixteenth</hi>, KING OF FRANCE AND NAVARRE.</caption>
<p>SIRE,</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">In</hi> recounting the numerous blessings which have
arisen to mankind from the discovery of America,
the mind dwells with particular pleasure and gratitude
upon those Characters, from whose hands these
blessings have immediately flowed. That change
in the political face of Europe, that liberality of
sentiment, that enlargement of commercial, military
and philosophical knowledge, which contrast the
present with the fifteenth century, are but so many
consequences of this great event; an event which
laid open all parts of the earth to the range of the
<pb n="v">
liberal mind. The illustrious line of your royal
Ancestors have been conspicuous in seizing those
advantages and diffusing their happy effects. The
great Father of the House of Bourbon will be held
in the highest veneration, till his favourite political
system shall be realized among the nations of Europe,
and extended to all mankind. But it was
left to his more glorious Descendant, to accelerate
the progress of society, by disregarding the temporary
interests and local policies of other Monarchs,
reaching the hand of beneficence to another hemisphere,
and raising an infant empire, in a few years,
to a degree of importance, which several ages were
scarcely thought sufficient to produce.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">This</hi> is the sublime of humanity, to feel for future
ages and distant nations; to act those things,
as a Monarch, which another can only contemplate
as a Philosopher, or image in the flights of poetry.
America acknowledges her obligations to the Guardian
of her rights; mankind, who survey your conduct,
and posterity, for whom you act, will see that
the tribute of gratitude is paid.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">If</hi> to patronize the Arts can add to the praise of
these more glorious actions, your Majesty's fame
in this respect will be ever sacred; as there are none,
who can feel the subject so strongly as those who
<pb n="vi">
are the particular objects of your royal condescension.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> following work, which may be considered
in part, as the offspring of those reflections which
your Majesty's conduct has taught me to make,
possesses one advantage scarcely to be expected in a
Poem written in a foreign language. Your Majesty's
permission, that the unfortunate Columbus
may once more enjoy the protection of a royal benefactor,
has added a new obligation to those I before
felt&mdash;in common with a grateful country. It is
the policy of wise Princes to encourage the liberal
arts among their subjects; and, as the human race
are the objects of your extended administration,
they may all in some measure claim the privilege
of subjects, in seeking your literary as well as political
protection.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">With</hi> the deepest sense of your Majesty's royal
munificence to my country, and gracious condescension
to myself, I have the honour to be,</p>

<prologue>
<caption>INTRODUCTION.</caption>
<p><hi r="smcap">Every</hi> circumstance relating to the discovery
and settlement of America, is an interesting object of
enquiry. Yet it is presumed, from the present state
of literature in this country, that many persons, who
might be entertained with an American production of
this kind, are but slightly acquainted with the life
and character of that great man, whose extraordinary
genius led him to the discovery of the continent, and
whose singular sufferings ought to excite the indignation
of the world.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> Spanish historians, who treat of the discovery
and settlement of South&hyphen;America, are very little known
in the United States; and Doctor Robertson's history
of that country, which, as is usual in the works of
that judicious writer, contains all that is valuable on
the subject, is not yet reprinted in America, and
therefore cannot be supposed to be in the hands of
American readers in general: and perhaps no other
writer in the English language has given a sufficient
account of the life of Columbus to enable them to understand
many of the necessary allusions in the following
Poem.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Christopher Columbus</hi> was born in the republic
of Genoa about the year 1447; at a time when
the navigation of Europe was scarcely extended beyond
the limits of the Mediterranean. The mariner's
compass had been invented and in common use
for more than a century; yet with the help of this
<pb n="viii">
sure guide, prompted by the most ardent spirit of
discovery, and encouraged by the patronage of princes,
the mariners of those days rarely ventured from
the sight of land. They acquired great applause by
sailing along the coast of Africa and discovering some
of the neighbouring islands; and after pushing their
researches with the greatest industry and perseverance
for more than half a century, the Portuguese, who were
the most fortunate and enterprising, extended their
discoveries southward no farther than the equator.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> rich commodities of the East had for several
ages been brought into Europe by the way of the Red
Sea and the Mediterranean; and it had now become
the object of the Portuguese to find a passage to India,
by sailing round the southern extremity of Africa
and then taking an eastern course. This great object
engaged the general attention of mankind, and drew
into the Portuguese service adventurers from every
maritime nation in Europe. Every year added to
their experience in navigation and seemed to promise
a reward to their industry. The prospect however of
arriving at the Indies was extremely distant; fifty years
perseverance in the same track, had brought them only
to the equator, and it was probable that as many more
would elapse before they could accomplish their purpose.
But Columbus, by an uncommon exertion of
genius, formed a design no less astonishing to the age
in which he lived, than beneficial to posterity. This
design was to sail to India by taking a western direction.
By the accounts of travellers who had visited
India, that country seemed almost without limits on
the east; and by attending to the spherical figure of
the earth, Columbus drew this conclusion, that the Atlantic
ocean must be bounded on the west either by
India itself, or by some great continent not far distant
from it.</p>
<pb n="ix">
<p><hi r="smcap">This</hi> extraordinary man, who was now about twenty&hyphen;seven
years of age, appears to have united in his
character every trait, and to have possessed every tallant,
requisite to form and execute the greatest enterprizes.
He was early educated in all the useful sciences
that were taught in that day. He had made
great proficiency in geography, astronomy and drawing,
as they were necessary to his favourite pursuit of
navigation. He had now been a number of years in
the service of the Portuguese, and had acquired all the
experience that their voyages and discoveries could
afford. His courage and perseverance had been put
to the severest test, and the exercise of every amiable
and heroic virtue rendered him universally known and
respected. He had married a Portuguese lady by
whom he had two sons, Diego and Fardinand; the
younger of whom is the historian of his life.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Such</hi> was the situation of Columbus, when he formed
and thoroughly digested a plan, which, in its operation
and consequences, unfolded to the view of
mankind one half of the globe, diffused wealth and
dignity over the other, and extended commerce and
civilization through the whole. To corroborate the
theory which he had formed of the existence of a western
continent, his descerning mind, which always
knew the application of every circumstance that fell
in his way, had observed several facts which by others
would have passed unnoticed. In his voyages to the
African islands he had found, floating ashore after a
long western storm, pieces of wood carved in a curious
manner, canes of a size unknown in that quarter
of the world, and human bodies with very singular
features. Fully confirmed in the opinion that a considerable
portion of the earth was still undiscovered,
his genius was too vigorous and persevering to suffer
an idea of this importance to rest merely in speculation,
<pb n="x">
as it had done in the minds of Plato and Seneca,
who appear to have had conjectures of a similar nature.
He determined therefore to bring his favourite
theory to the test of actual experiment. But an object
of that magnitude required the patronage of a
Prince; and a design so extraordinary met with all
the obstructions, delays and disappointments, which
an age of superstition could invent, and which personal
jealousy and malice could magnify and encourage.
Happily for mankind, in this instance, a genius, capable
of devising the greatest undertakings, associated
in itself a degree of patience and enterprize, modesty
and confidence, which rendered him superior,
not only to these misfortunes, but to all the future calamities
of his life. Prompted by the most ardent
enthusiasm to be the discoverer of new continents, and
fully sensible of the advantages that would result to
mankind from such discoveries, he had the mortification
to waste away eighteen years of his life, after his
system was well established in his own mind, before
he could obtain the means of executing his designs.
The greatest part of this period was spent in successive
and fruitless solicitations, at Genoa, Portugal and
Spain. As a duty to his native country, he made his
first proposal to the Senate of Genoa; where it was
soon rejected. Conscious of the truth of his theory,
and of his own abilities to execute his design, he retired
without dejection from a body of men who were
incapable of forming any just ideas upon the subject;
and applied with fresh confidence to John the second,
King of Portugal, who had distinguished himself as
the great patron of navigation, and in whose service
Columbus had acquired a reputation which entitled
him and his project to general confidence and approbation.
But here he suffered an insult much greater
than a direct refusal. After referring the examination
of his scheme to the council who had the direction
<pb n="xi">
of naval affairs, and drawing from him his general
ideas of the length of the voyage and the course
he meant to take, that great monarch had the meanness
to conspire with this council to rob Columbus of
the glory and advantage he expected to derive from
his undertaking. While Columbus was amused with
this negotiation, in hopes of having his scheme adopted
and patronized, a vessel was secretly dispatched,
by order of the king, to make the intended discovery.
Want of skill and perseverance in the pilot rendered
the plot unsuccessful; and Columbus, on discovering
the treachery, retired with an ingenuous indignation
from a court capable of such duplicity.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Having</hi> now performed what was due to the country
that gave him birth and to the one that had adopted
him as a subject, he was at liberty to court the
patronage of any prince who should have the wisdom
and justice to accept his proposals. He had communicated
his ideas to his brother Bartholomew, whom
he sent to England to negotiate with Henry seventh;
at the same time that he went himself into Spain to
apply in person to Fardinand and Isabella, who governed
the united kingdoms of Aragon and Castile.
The circumstances of his brother's application in England,
which appears to have been unsuccessful, is not
to my purpose to relate; and the limits prescribed to
this introduction will prevent the detail of all the particulars
relating to his own negociation in Spain. In
this negociation Columbus spent eight years, in the
various agitations of suspence, expectation and disappointment;
till, at length his scheme was adopted by
Isabella, who undertook, as Queen of Castile, to destroy
the expences of the expedition; and declared
herself, ever after, the friend and patron of the hero
who projected it.</p>
<pb n="xii">
<p><hi r="smcap">Columbus</hi>, who, during all his ill success in the negotiation,
never abated any thing of the honours and
emoluments which he expected to acquire in the expedition,
obtained from Fardinand and Isabella a full
stipulation of every article contained in his first proposals.
He was constituted high Admiral and Viceroy
of all the Seas, Islands and Continents which he
should discover; with power to receive one tenth
of the profits arising from their productions and commerce.
These offices and emoluments were to be
hereditary in his family.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">These</hi> articles being adjusted, the preparations for
the voyage were brought forward with rapidity; but
they were by no means adequate to the importance of
the expedition. Three small vessels, scarcely sufficient
in size to be employed in the coasting business,
were appointed to traverse the vast Atlantic; and to
encounter the storms and currents that might be expected
in so lengthy a voyage, through distant and unknown
seas. These vessels, as might be expected in
the infancy of navigation, were ill constructed, in a
poor condition, and manned by seamen unaccustomed
to distant voyages. But the tedious length of time
which Columbus had spent in solicitation and suspence,
and the prospect of being able soon, to obtain
the object of his wishes, induced him to overlook
what he could not easily remedy, and led him to disregard
those circumstances which would have intimidated
any other mind. He accordingly equiped his
small squadron with as much expedition as possible,
manned with ninety men and victualled for one year.
With these, on the 3d of August 1492, amidst a vast
croud of anxious spectators, he set sail on an enterprize,
which, if we consider the ill condition of his
ships, the inexperience of his sailors, the length and
<pb n="xiii">
uncertainty of his voyage, and the consequences that
flowed from it, was the most daring and important
that ever was undertaken. He touched at some of
the Portuguese settlements in the Canary Isles; where,
although he had had but a few days run, he found his
vessels needed refitting. He soon made the necessary
repairs, and took his departure from the westermost
Islands that had hitherto been discovered. Here he
left the former track of navigation and steered his
course due west.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Not</hi> many days after he had been at sea, he began to
experience a new scene of difficulty. The sailors
now began to contemplate the dangers and uncertain
issue of a voyage, the nature and length of which was
left entirely open to conjecture. Besides the fickleness
and timidity natural to men unaccustomed to the
discipline of a seafaring life, several circumstances
contributed to inspire an obstinate and mutinous disposition,
which required the most consummate art as
well as fortitude in the admiral to controul. Having
been three weeks at sea, and experienced the uniform
course of the trade winds, which always blow in a western
direction, they contended that, should they continue
the same course for a longer period, the same
winds would never permit them to return to Spain.
The magnetic needle began to vary its direction.
This being the first time that phenomenon was ever
discovered, it was viewed by the sailors with astonishment,
and considered as an indication that nature itself
had changed her course, and that Providence was
determined to punish their audacity, in venturing so far
beyond the ordinary bounds of man. They declared
that the commands of their sovereign had been fully
obeyed, in their proceeding so many days in the same
direction, and so far surpassing the attempts of all former
<pb n="xiv">
navigators, in quest of new discoveries. Every
talent, requisite for governing, soothing and tempering
the passions of men, is conspicuous in the conduct
of Columbus on this occasion. The dignity and affability
of his manners, his surprising knowledge and
experience in naval affairs, his unwearied and minute
attention to the duties of his command gave him a
complete ascendant over the minds of his men, and
inspired that degree of confidence which would have
maintained his authority in almost any possible circumstances.
But here, from the nature of the undertaking,
every man had leisure to feed his imagination
with all the gloominess and uncertainty of the prospect.
They found, every day, that the same steady
gales carried them with great rapidity from their native
country, and indeed from all countries of which
they had any knowledge. Notwithstanding all the
variety of management with which Columbus addressed
himself to their passions, sometimes by soothing them
with the prognostics of discovering land, sometimes
by flattering their ambition and feasting their avarice
with the glory and wealth they would acquire from
discovering those rich countries beyond the Atlantic,
and sometimes by threatening them with the displeasure
of their sovereign, should their timidity and disobedience
defeat so great an object, their uneasiness
still increased. From secret whisperings, it arose to open
mutiny and dangerous conspiracy. At length
they determined to rid themselves of the remonstrances
of Columbus, by throwing him into the sea. The
infection spread from ship to ship, and involved Officers
as well as common sailors. They finally lost all
sense of subordination, and addressed their commander
in an insolent manner, demanding to be conducted
immediately back to Spain; or, they assured him, they
would seek their own safety by taking away his life.
<pb n="xv">
Columbus, whose sagacity and penetration had discovered
every symptom of the disorder, was prepared
for this last stage of it, and was sufficiently apprized of
the danger that awaited him. He found it vain to contend
with passions he could no longer controul. He
therefore proposed that they should obey his orders for
three days longer; and, should they not discover
land in that time, he would then direct his course for
Spain. They complied with his proposal; and, happily
for mankind, in three days they discovered Land.
This was a small Island, to which Columbus gave the
name of San Salvador. Their first interview with the
natives was a scene of amusement and compassion
on the one part, and of astonishment and adoration
on the other. The natives were entirely naked, simple
and timorous, and they viewed the Spaniards as a
superior order of beings, descended from the Sun,
which, in that Island and in most parts of America, was
worshiped as a Deity. By this it was easy for Columbus
to perceive the line of conduct proper to be observed
toward that simple and inoffensive people.
Had his companions and successors, of the Spanish nation
possessed the wisdom and humanity of that great
discoverer, the benevolent mind would feel no sensations,
of regret, in contemplating the extensive advantages
arising to mankind from the discovery of America.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">In</hi> this voyage, Columbus discovered the Islands of
Cuba and Hispaniola; on the latter of which, he erected
a small fort, and having left a garrison of thirty&hyphen;eight
men, under the command of an Officer by the
name of Arada, he set sail for Spain. Returning across
the Atlantic, he was overtaken by a violent
storm, which lasted several days and increased to such
a degree, as baffled all his naval skill and threatened
<pb n="xvi">
immediate destruction. In this situation, when all
were in a state of despair, and it was expected that every
sea would swallow up the crazy vessel, he manifested
a serenity and presence of mind, perhaps never equalled
in cases of like extremity. He wrote a short
account of his voyage and of the discoveries he had
made, wrapped it in an oiled cloth, enclosed it in a
cake of wax, put it into an empty cask and threw it overboard;
in hopes that some accident might preserve
a deposit of so much importance to the world.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> storm however abated, and he at length arrived
in Spain, after having been driven by stress of
weather into the Port of Lisbon, where he had opportunity
in an interview with the King of Portugal, to
prove the truth of his system by arguments more convincing
than those he had before advanced, in the
character of an humble and unsuccessful suitor. He
was received every where in Spain with Royal honours,
his family was ennobled, and his former stipulation
respecting his offices and emoluments was ratified
in the most solemn manner, by Fardinand and Isabella;
while all Europe resounded his praises and reciprocated
their joy and congratulations on the discovery
of a new world.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> immediate consequence of this was a second
voyage; in which Columbus took charge of a squadron
of seventeen Ships of considerable burthen. Volunteers
of all ranks and conditions solicited to be
employed in this expedition. He carried over fifteen
hundred persons, together with all the necessaries
for establishing a Colony and extending his discoveries.
In this voyage he explored most of the
West&hyphen;India Islands; but, on his arrival at Hispaniola,
he found the garrison he had left there had been totally
<pb n="xvii">
destroyed by the natives, and the fort demolished.
He however proceeded in the planting of his colony;
and, by his prudent and humane conduct towards
the natives, he effectually established the Spanish authority
in that Island. But while he was thus laying
the foundation of their future grandeur in South America,
some discontented persons, who had returned
from the colony to Spain, together with his former
enemies in that Kingdom, conspired to accomplish
his ruin.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">They</hi> represented his conduct in such a light at
court, as to create uneasiness and distrust in the jealous
mind of Fardinand, and made it necessary for Columbus
again to return to Spain, in order to counteract
their machinations, and to obtain such farther supplies
as were necessary to his great political and benevolent
purposes. On his arriving at court, and
stating with his usual dignity and confidence the
whole history of his transactions abroad, every thing
wore a favourable appearance. He was received with
usual honours, and again solicited to take charge of
another squadron, to carry out farther supplies, to
pursue his discoveries, and in every respect to use his
discretion in extending the Spanish Empire in the new
World. In this third voyage he discovered the Continent
of America at the mouth of the river Oronoque.
He rectified many disorders in his government of Hispaniola
which had happened in his absence; and every
thing was going on in a prosperous train, when an
event was announced to him, which completed his
own ruin, and gave a fatal turn to the Spanish policy
and conduct in America. This was the arrival of
Francis de Bovadilla, with a commission to supercede
Columbus in his government; and with power to arraign
him as a criminal, and to judge of his former
administration.</p>
<pb n="xviii">
<p><hi r="smcap">It</hi> seems that by this time the enemies of Columbus,
despairing to complete his overthrow by groundless
insinuations of mal&hyphen;conduct, had taken the more effectual
method of exciting the jealousy of their Sovereigns.
From the promising samples of Gold and other
valuable commodities brought from America, they
took occasion to represent to the King and Queen, that
the prodigious wealth and extent of the countries he
had discovered would soon throw such power into the
hands of the Viceroy, that he would trample on the
Royal Authority and bid defiance to the Spanish power.
These arguments were well calculated for the
cold and suspicious temper of Fardinand, and they
must have had some effect upon the mind of Isabella.
The consequence was the appointment of Bavadilla,
who had been the inveterate enemy of Columbus, to
take the government from his hands. This first tyrant
of the Spanish nation in America began his administration
by ordering Columbus to be put in chains on
board a ship, and sending him prisoner to Spain. By
relaxing all discipline he introduced disorder and licenciousness
throughout the colony. He subjected the
unhappy natives to a most miserable servitude, and apportioned
them out in large numbers among his adherents.
Under this severe treatment perished in a short
time many thousands of those innocent people.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Columbus</hi> was carried in his fetters to the Spanish
court, where the King and Queen either feigned or
felt a sufficient regret at the conduct of Bovadilla towards
this illustrious prisoner. He was not only released
from confinement, but treated with all imaginable
respect. But, although the king endeavoured to
expiate the offence by censuring and recalling Bovadilla,
yet we may judge of his sincerity from his appointing
Nicholas de Ovando, another bitter enemy
of Columbus, to succeed in the government, and from
<pb n="xix">
his ever after refusing to reinstate Columbus, or to fulfil
any of the conditions on which the discoveries
were undertaken. After two years solicitation for this
or some other employment, he at length obtained a
squadron of four small vessels to attempt new discoveries.
He now set out, with the ardour and enthusiasm
of a young adventurer, in quest of what was always
his favourite object, a passage into the South Sea, by
which he might sail to India. He touched at Hispaniola,
where Ovando, the governor, refused him admittance
on shore even to take shelter during a hurricane,
the prognostics of which his experience had taught
him to discern. By putting into a small creek, he
rode out the storm, and then bore away for the continent.
Several months, in the most boisterous season
of the year, he spent in exploring the coast round the
gulph of Mexico in hopes of finding the intended
navigation to India. At length he was shipwrecked,
and driven ashore on the Island of Jamaica.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">His</hi> cup of calamities seemed now completely full.
He was cast upon an island of savages, without provisions,
without any vessel, and thirty leagues from
any Spanish settlement. But the greatest providential
misfortunes are capable of being imbittered by
the insults of our fellow creatures. A few of his
hardy companions generously offered, in two Indian
canoes, to attempt a voyage to Hispaniola, in hopes
of obtaining a vessel for the relief of the unhappy
crew. After suffering every extremity of danger and
hardship, they arrived at the Spanish colony in ten
days. Ovando, through personal malice and jealousy
of Columbus, after having detained these messengers
eight months, dispatched a vessel to Jamaica,
in order to spy out the condition of Columbus and
his crew; with positive instructions to the Captain
not to afford them any relief. This order was
punctually executed. The Captain approached the
<pb n="xx">
shore, delivered a letter of empty compliment from
Ovando to the Admiral, received his answer and returned.
About four months afterwards a vessel came
to their relief; and Columbus, worn out with fatigues
and broken with misfortunes, returned for the last
time to Spain. Here a new distress awaited him,
which he considered as one of the greatest he had suffered,
in his whole life. This was the death of Queen
Isabella, his last and greatest friend.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">He</hi> did not suddenly abandon himself to despair.
He called upon the gratitude and justice of the King;
and, in terms of dignity, demanded the fulfilment of
his former contract. Notwithstanding his age and
infirmities, he even solicited to be farther employed
in extending the career of discovery, without a prospect
of any other reward but the consciousness of doing
good to mankind. But Fardinand, cold, ungrateful
and timid, dared not to comply with a single proposal
of this kind, lest he should encrease his own obligations
to a man, whose services he thought it dangerous
to reward. He therefore delayed and avoided any
decision on these subjects, in hopes that the declining
health of Columbus would soon rid the court of the
remonstrances of a man, whose extraordinary merit
was, in their opinion, a sufficient occasion of destroying
him. In this they were not disappointed. Columbus
languished a short time, and gladly resigned a
life, which had been worn out in the most essential
services perhaps that were ever rendered, by any human
character, to an ungrateful world.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Sometime</hi> in this gloomy interval, before his death,
the Vision is supposed to have been presented to him;
in order to satisfy his benevolent mind, by unfolding
to him the importance of his discoveries, in their extensive
influence upon the interest and happiness of
mankind, in the progress of society.</p>
<pb n="xxi">
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> Author has indulged a small anachronism in
the opening of the Poem, for the sake of grouping
the misfortunes of the hero; as the time of his actual
imprisonment was previous to his last voyage and
to the death of Isabella.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> Author, at first, formed an idea of attempting
a regular Epic Poem, on the discovery of America.
But on examining the nature of that event, he found
that the most brilliant subjects incident to such a plan
would arise from the consequences of the discovery,
and must be represented in vision. Indeed to have
made it a patriotic Poem, by extending the subject to
the settlement and revolutions of North America and
their probable effect upon the future progress of society
at large, would have protracted the vision to such
a degree as to render it disproportionate to the rest
of the work. To avoid an absurdity of this kind,
which he supposed the critics would not pardon, he
rejected the idea of a regular Epic form, and has confined
his plan to the train of events which might be represented
to the hero in vision. This form he considers
as the best that the nature of the subject would
admit; and the regularity of the parts will appear by
observing, that there is a single poetical design constantly
kept in view, which is to gratify and sooth the
desponding mind of the hero: It being the greatest
possible reward of his services, and the only one that
his situation would permit him to enjoy, to convince
him that his labours had not been bestowed in vain,
and that he was the author of such extensive happiness
to the human race.</p></prologue>

<caption r="roman">ARGUMENT.</caption>
Natives of America appear in vision. Their manners
and characters. Columbus enquires the cause of the
dissimilarity of nations. The Angel replies&mdash;That
the human body is composed of a due proportion of the
elements suited to the place of its first creation&mdash;that
these elements, differently proportioned, produce all the
changes of health, sickness, growth and decay; and
will likewise produce any other changes which occasion
the diversity of men&mdash;that these elemental proportions
are varied, not more by climate, than temperature,
and many other local accidents&mdash;that the mind
is likewise in a state of change, and will take its physical
character from the body and from external objects:
examples. Enquiry and answer concerning the
first peopling of America. View of Mexico. Its destruction
by Cortez. View of Cusco and Quito,
cities of Peru. Tradition of Capac and Oella, founders
of the Peruvian empire. Columbus enquires
their real history. The Angel gives an account of
their origin, and relates the stratagems they used in
establishing that empire.</argument>

<l ln="488    ">To bless the nations <edit>[Footnote: <bytes>5Kb</bytes>]</edit><note idref="AN000061"><p>From the traditions of Capac and Oella, mentioned by the
Spanish historians, they appear to have been very great and distinguished
characters. About three centuries previous to the discovery
of that country by the Spaniards, the natives of Peru were as
rude savages as any in America. They had no fixed habitations,
no ideas of permanent property; they wandered naked like the
beasts, and, like them, depended on the events of each day for a
precarious subsistence. At this period, Manco Capac and his wife
Mama Oella appeared on a small island in the lake Titiaca; near
which the city of Cusco was afterwards erected. These persons, in
order to establish a belief of their divinity, in the minds of the people,
were clothed in white garments of cotton; and declared themselves
descended from the Sun, who was their father and the God
of that country. They affirmed that he was offended at their cruel
and perpetual wars, their barbarous modes of worship, and their
neglecting to make the best use of the blessings he was constantly
bestowing, in fertilizing the earth and producing vegetation; that
he pitied their wretched state, and had sent his own children to instruct
them, and to establish a number of wise regulations, by which
they might be rendered happy.</p>
<p>By some extraordinary method of persuasion, these persons drew
together a number of the savage tribes, laid the foundations of the
city of Cusco, and established what was called the kingdom of
the Sun, or the Peruvian empire. In the reign of the Manco Capac,
the dominion was extended about eight leagues from the city;
and at the end of three centuries, it was established fifteen hundred
miles on the coast of the Pacific ocean; and from that ocean to the
mountains of the Andes. During this period, through a succession
of twelve monarchs, the original constitution, established by the first
Inca, remained unaltered; and was at last overturned by an accident,
which no human wisdom could foresee or prevent.</p>
<p>For a more particular disquisition on the character and institutions
of this great Legislator, the Reader is referred to a dissertation
prefixed to the third Book.</p>
<p>Mama Oella is said to have invented many of the domestic arts,
particularly that of making garments of cotton and other vegetable
substances.</p>
<p>In the passage preceding this reference, I have alluded to most
of the traditions, relating to the manner of their introducing themselves,
and establishing their dominion. In the remainder of the
second, and through the whole of the third Book, I have given what
may be supposed a probable narrative of their real origin and conduct.
I have thrown the episode into an epic form, and given it
so considerable a place in the Poem, for the purpose of exhibiting
<hi r="italic">in action</hi> the characters, manners and sentiments of the different
tribes of savages, that inhabit the mountains of South&hyphen;America.</p>
<p>In reviewing this part of my subject, I have to lament, that so
extraordinary and meritorious a Poem, as the Araucana of don
Alonso de Ercilla, of the sixteenth century, has never yet appeared
in our language. The account given of that work by Voltaire excited
my curiosity at an early day; as I conceived the manners and
characters of the mountain savages of Chile, as described by that
heroic Spaniard, must have opened a new field of Poetry, rich with
uncommon ornaments.</p>
<p>That elegant and concise sketch of it lately given to the public
by Mr. Hayley, has come into my hands, since I have been
writing these notes, and but a few days previous to the Poem's being
put to the press. Yet it gives me reason to hope, with every
friend of literature, that the whole of that great work will ere long
be presented to the English Reader by the same hand.</p>
<p>It is usually presumed, that every Author must have read all that
have gone before him, at least on subjects similar to what he attempts;
yet the Lusiad of Camoens, a Poem of great merit on the
expedition of Gama, I had sought for in vain in different parts of
America, and even sent to Europe without being able to obtain it;
till, a few days since, it came to hand in the majestic and spirited
translation of Mr. Mickle. The extensive and sublime objects
opened to our view in a work which celebrates the discovery of one
part of the globe, may well be thought worthy the contemplation of
a writer, who endeavours to trace the consequences of a similar
event in another. Of this I was before sensible; but these are not
the only disadvantages that an Author, in a new country, and in
moderate circumstances, must have to encounter.</p></note> and reform mankind.</l></pdiv>

<caption r="smcap"><hi r="roman">A DISSERTATION</hi> On the <hi r="roman">GENIUS AND INSTITUTIONS OF MANCO CAPAC</hi>.</caption>
<p><hi r="smcap">Although</hi> the original inhabitants of America
in general deserve to be classed among the
most unimproved savages that have ever been discovered;
yet the Mexican and Peruvian governments
exhibit remarkable instances of order and regularity.
In the difference of national character between these
two empires, we may discern the influence of political
systems on the human mind; and infer the importance
of the task which a legislator undertakes, in attempting
to reduce a barbarous people under the controul
of government and laws. The Mexican constitution
was formed to render its subjects brave and
powerful; but, while it succeeded in this object, it
tended to remove them farther from the real blessings
of society, than they were, while in the rudest state of
nature. The history of the world affords no instance
of men whose manners were equally ferocious, and
whose superstition was more bloody and unrelenting.
On the contrary, the establishments of Manco Capac
carry the marks of a most benevolent and pacific
system; they tended to humanize the world and render
his people happy; while his ideas of the Deity
were so perfect, as to bear a comparison with the enlightened
doctrines of Socrates or Plato.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> most distinguished characters in history,
who have been considered as legislators among barbarous
<pb n="78">
nations, are Moses, Lycurgus, Solon, Numa,
Mahomet and Peter of Russia. Of these, only the
two former and the two latter appear really to deserve
that character. Solon and Numa possessed not the
means nor the opportunity of shewing their talents in
the business of original legislation. Athens and Rome
were considerably advanced in civilization, before these
characters arose. The most they could do was to
correct and amend constitutions already formed. Solon,
in particular, may be considered as a wife politician;
but by no means as the founder of a nation.
The Athenians were too far advanced in society to
admit any radical alteration in their form of government;
if indeed any form can be said to exist, where
every thing is left to the controul of a capricious
multitude. The institutions of Numa were more effective
and durable; his religious ceremonies were,
for many ages, the most powerful check upon the licentious
and turbulent Romans. By inculcating a
remarkable reverence for the Gods, and making it necessary
to consult the Auspices, when any thing important
was to be transacted, he rendered the popular
superstition subservient to the views of policy, and
gave the senate a steady check upon the extravagance
of the plebeans. But the constitutions of Rome and
Athens, however the subject of so much injudicious
applause, were never fixed upon any permanent principles;
though the wisdom of some of their rulers,
and the spirit of liberty that inspired the people, justly
demand our admiration.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Each</hi> of the other legislators above mentioned deserves
a particular consideration; as acting in stations
somewhat similar to that of the Peruvian lawgiver.
Three objects are to be attended to, by the legislator
of a barbarous people. <hi r="italic">First</hi>, that his system be such
as is capable of reducing the greatest number of men
under one jurisdiction. <hi r="italic">Secondly</hi>, that it apply to such
<pb n="79">
principles in human nature for its support, as are universal
and permanent; in order to ensure the duration
of the government. <hi r="italic">Thirdly</hi>, that it admit of improvements
correspondent to any advancement in
knowledge or variation of circumstances, that may
happen to its subjects; without endangering the principle
of government, by such innovations. So far
therefore as the systems of those legislators agree with
these fundamental principles, they are worthy of respect;
and so far as they deviate, they may be considered
as defective and imperfect.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">To</hi> begin with Moses and Lycurgus; it is necessary
in the first place to observe, that, in order to judge of
the merit of any institutions, we must take into view
the peculiar character of the people for whom they
were framed. For want of this attention, many of the
laws of Moses have been ridiculed by ignorant sceptics,
and many establishments of Lycurgus censured
by as ignorant politicians. The Jews, who were led
by Moses out of Egypt, were not only uncivilized,
but, having just risen to independence from a state of
servitude, they united the manners of servants and
savages; and their national character is a composition
of servility and contumacy, ignorance, superstition,
filthiness and cruelty. Of their cruelty as a people we
need no other proof than the account of their avengers
of blood, and the readiness with which the whole congregation
turned executioners and stoned to death the
devoted offenders. The Leprosy, a disease now wholly
unknown, was undoubtedly produced by their total
want of cleanliness, continued for successive generations.
In this view the frequent ablutions, the peculiar
modes of trial, and many other institutions may be
wholly vindicated from ridicule, and proved to be nor
only wise, but even necessary regulations.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> Spartan lawgiver has been equally censured
<pb n="80">
for the toleration of theft and adultery. Among that
race of Barbarians, these crimes were too general to
admit of total prevention or universal punishment. By
vesting all property in the community, instead of encouraging
theft, he removed the possibility of the crime;
and, in a nation where licentiousness was generally indulged,
it was a great step towards introducing a purity
of manners, to punish adultery in all cases, wherein the
crime was not committed by the free consent of all
parties injured or interested.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Those</hi> constitutions of government are best calculated
for immediate energy and duration, which are
interwoven with some religious system. The legislator,
who appears in the character of an inspired person,
renders his political institutions sacred, and interests
the conscience as well as the judgement in their support.
The Jewish lawgiver had this advantage over
the Spartan. He appeared not in the character of a
mere earthly governor, but as an interpreter of the
divine will. By injoining a religious observance of
certain rites, he formed his people to habitual obedience;
by directing their cruelty against the breakers
of the laws, he at least mitigated the rancour of private
hatred; by forbidding usury, and directing that real
property should return to the original families in the
year of Jubilee, he prevented too great an inequality
of property; and by selecting a particular tribe, to be
the guardians and interpreters of religion, he prevented
its mysteries from being the subject of profane and
vulgar investigation. To secure the permanency of
his institutions, he prohibited any intercourse with
foreigners, by severe restrictions; and formed his people
to habits and a character disagreeable to other nations;
by which means any foreign intercourse was
prevented, from the mutual hatred of both parties.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">To</hi> these institutions the laws of Lycurgus bear a
<pb n="81">
most striking resemblance. The features of his constitution
were severe and forbidding; it was however
calculated to inspire the most enthusiastic love of liberty
and martial honour. In no country was the
patriotic passion more energetic than in Sparta; no
laws ever excluded the idea of separate property in an
equal degree, or inspired a more thorough contempt
for the manners of other nations. The utter prohibition
of money, commerce and almost every thing desirable
to effeminate nations, entirely excluded foreigners
from Sparta; and, while it inspired the people
with contempt for others, it rendered them agreeable
to each other. By these means, Lycurgus rendered
the nation powerful and warlike; and to insure the
duration of his government he endeavoured to interest
the consciences of his people, by the aid of oracles and
the oath he is said to have exacted from them, to obey
his laws till his return; when he went into a voluntary
and perpetual exile.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">From</hi> this view of the Jewish and Spartan institutions,
applied to the principles above stated, they appear,
in the two first articles, considerably imperfect,
and in the last, totally defective. Neither of them
was calculated to bring any considerable territory or
number of men under one jurisdiction; from this circumstance
alone, they could not be rendered permanent,
as they must be constantly exposed to their more
powerful neighbours. But the third object of legislation,
that of providing for the future progress of society,
which, as it regards the happiness of mankind,
is the most important of the three, was in both instances
entirely neglected. These systems appear to have
been formed with an express design to prevent all future
improvement in knowledge, or enlargement of
the human mind; and to fix those nations forever in
a state of ignorance, superstition and barbarism. To
<pb n="82">
vindicate the Spartan from an imputation of weakness
or inattention in this particular, it may be urged that
he was surrounded by nations more powerful than his
own; it was therefore impossible for him to commence
an establishment upon any other plan. And
Moses must be vindicated upon this idea, that the divine
moral law, which was designed, at a future period,
to regulate and harmonize the whole human race,
must be preserved in that nation, which was to give
birth to the Saviour of mankind. If we allow him to
have had a prophetic knowledge of these events,
his institutions may be pronounced unexceptionable
in every part.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">The</hi> institutions of Mahomet, are next to be considered.
The first object of legislation appears to
have been better understood by the Arabian Prophet,
than by either of the preceding sages; his jurisdiction
was capable of being enlarged to any extent of
territory, and governing any number of nations, that
might be subjugated by his powerful and enthusiastic
armies; and to obtain this object his system of religion
was admirably calculated. Like Moses, he convinced
his people that he acted as the vicegerent of
Heaven; but with this capital advantage, adapting
his religion to the natural feelings and propensities of
mankind, he multiplied his followers, by the allurements
of pleasure and the promise of a sensual paradise.
These circumstances were likewise sure to render
his constitution permanent. His religious system
was so easy to be understood, so splendid and so inviting,
there could be no danger that the people would
lose sight of its principles, and no necessity of future
prophets, to explain the doctrines, or reform the nation.
To these advantages if we add the exact and
rigid military discipline, the splendor and sacredness
of the monarch, and that total ignorance of the people,
which such a system will produce and perpetuate, the
<pb n="83">
establishment must be evidently well calculated for
extent and duration. But the last and most important
end of government, that of mental improvement
and social happiness, was deplorably lost in the institution.
And there was probably more learning and
real genius in Arabia, in the days of this extraordinary
character, than can now be found in all the Turkish
dominions.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">On</hi> the contrary, the enterprising genius of the
Russian monarch appears to have been wholly bent on
the arts of civilization, and the improvement of society
among his subjects. Happy in a legal title to a
throne which already commanded a prodigious extent
of country, he found that the first object of government
was already secured; and by applying himself
with great sagacity and perseverance, to the third object,
he was sure that the second would be a necessary
and invariable consequence. He effected his purposes,
important as they were, merely by the introduction
of the arts, and the encouragement of politer
manners. The greatness of his genius appears not so
much in his institutions, which he copied from other
nations, as in the extraordinary measures he followed
to introduce them, the judgement he showed in selecting
and adapting them to the genius of his subjects,
and his surprising assiduity and success, by which he
raised a savage people to a dignified rank among European
nations. All his plans were formed to encourage
the future progress of society; and their duration
was ensured by their obvious value and importance.
His successors have followed his political measures,
with great attention to the same objects; and
the present reigning empress has rendered herself not
unworthy of so high and honourable a descent.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">To</hi> the genius and operation of the several forms
of government above mentioned, we will compare
<pb n="84">
that of the Peruvian Lawgiver. It is probable that
the savages of Peru, before the time of Capac, among
other objects of adoration, paid homage to the Sun.
By availing himself of this popular sentiment, he appeared,
like Moses and Mahomet, in the character of
a divine legislator, endowed with supernatural powers.
After impressing these ideas strongly on the
minds of the people, drawing together a number of
the tribes and rendering them subservient to his benevolent
purposes, he applied himself to forming the
outlines of a plan of policy, capable of sounding and
regulating an extensive empire; wisely calculated for
perpetual duration; and expressly designed to improve
the knowledge, peace and happiness of a considerable
portion of mankind. In the apportionment
of the lands, and the assignment of real property, he
invented a mode somewhat resembling the Feudal
System of Europe: yet this system was wisely checked
in its operation, by a law similar to that of Moses,
which regulated landed possessions in the year of Jubilee.
He divided the lands into three parts; the
first was consecrated to the uses of religion, the second
set apart for the Inca and his family, to enable
him to defray the expences of government and to appear
in the style of a monarch, the third, and much
the largest portion, was allotted to the people; and
this allotment was repeated every year, and varied according
to the number and exigencies of each family.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">As</hi> the Incan family appeared in the character of
Divinities, it was necessary that a subordination of
ranks should be established; in order to render the
distinction between the monarch and his people more
perceptible. With this view he created a band of
Nobles, who were distinguished by personal and hereditary
honours. These were united to the monarch
by the strongest ties of interest; in peace they acted
as Judges, and superintended the police of the empire,
<pb n="85">
in war they commanded in the armies. The next
order of men were the respectable peasantry of the
country, who composed the principal strength of the
nation. Below these was a class of men, who were
the servants of the public; who cultivated the public
lands. They possessed no property, and their only
security depended on their regular industry and peaceable
demeanour. Above all these orders, were the
Inca and his family. He was possessed of absolute
and uncontroulable power; his mandates
were regarded as the word of Heaven, and the
double guilt of impiety and rebellion attended on
disobedience. To impress the utmost veneration
for the Incan family, it was a fundamental principle,
that the royal blood should never be contaminated
by any foreign alliance. The mysteries of religion
were preserved sacred by the high priest of the
royal family, under the controul of the king; and
celebrated with rites, capaple of making the deepest
impression on the multitude. The annual distribution
of the lands, while it provided for the varying
circumstances of each family, strengthened the bands
of society, by preventing the different orders from interfering
with each other; the peasants could not vie
with their superiors, and the Nobles could not be
subjected by misfortune to a subordinate station. A
constant habit of industry was inculcated upon all
ranks by the surprizing force of example and emulation.
The cultivation of the soil, which in most other
countries is considered as one of the lowest employments,
was here regarded as a divine art. Having
had no idea of it before, and being taught it by the
children of their God, the people viewed it as a sacred
privilege, and considered it as an honour, to imitate
and assist the Sun in opening the bosom of the earth
and producing vegetation. That the government
might be able to exercise the endearing acts of benevolence,
the produce of the public lands was reserved
<pb n="86">
in magazines, to supply the wants of the unfortunate,
as a deposit for the people in times of general
scarcity, and as a resource in case of an invasion.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">These</hi> are the outlines of a government, the most
simple and energetic conceivable, and capable of reducing
the greatest number of men under one jurisdiction;
at the same time, accommodating its principle
of action to every state of society, and every stage of
improvement, by a singular and happy application to
the passions of the human mind, it encouraged the advancement
of knowledge, without being endangered
by success. That such a government has a fair
chance for perpetual duration is evident from this
consideration, that a band of Nobles are ever the firm
supporters of regal authority; unless the monarch is
so limited in his power, that the Nobles despise his influence.
This could not be the case in Peru; the
Nobles were justly proud of their elevated station,
though they could have no ambition to controul the
Inca. They were sensible that their interest was connected
with that of the monarch; and, supposing the
influence of religion to be out of the question, they
would not attempt to destroy an institution on which
their happiness depended. A check equally effective
was, by the constitution of human nature, imposed on
the Inca. Elevated above the competition and rivalship
which corrode and torment the bosoms of the
great, he could have no ambition to gratify and no
motive to induce him to an improper exercise of arbitrary
power.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">In</hi> the traits of character which distinguish this
institution, we may discern all the great strokes of
each of the legislators above mentioned. The pretensions
of Capac to divine authority were as artfully
contrived and as effectual in their consequences, as
those of Mahomet; his exploding the worship of evil
<pb n="87">
beings and objects of terror, forbidding human sacrifices,
inculcating more rational ideas of the Deity,
and accommodating the rites of worship to a God of
justice and benevolence, produced a greater change in
the national character of his people, than any of the
laws of Moses: Like Peter, he provided for the future
improvement of society; while his actions were
never measured upon the small and contracted scale,
which limited the genius of Lycurgus.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Thus</hi> far we find the political system of Capac at
least equal to those of the most celebrated ancient or
modern lawgivers. But in one particular his character
is placed beyond all comparison; I mean for his
religious institutions, and the just ideas he had formed,
by the unenlightened efforts of human wisdom, of the
nature and attributes of the Deity.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">And</hi> here I shall premise, that idolatrous nations
have never been guilty of those glaring absurdities
with which they are usually charged by the christian
world. The Persian or Peruvian, when he directed
his adoration to the Sun, considered it as the place of
residence for the unknown Deity, whom he worshipped,
and who communicated from thence the
blessings of light, warmth and vegetation; the Greek,
who bowed at the statue of Jupiter, supposed it animated
with the presence of his God; the Egyptian
Apis, Isis and Orus, the calf, the leek and the onion,
though the theme of universal ridicule to other nations,
were, in their first consecration, like the Jewish Cherubim,
symbolical representations of the nature and attributes
of their Deities. No man ever erected a stock
or a stone for a real object of worship; but all ignorant
nations have paid their adoration before the symbol
of the Deity, in some shape or other, and directed
their homage to the place of his supposed residence.
Even among enlightened nations, we find many traces
<pb n="88">
of the same ideas; the Papist bows to the Picture and
the Crucifix; and the Methodist rolls up his eyes in
prayer to the Sky. Perhaps unassisted wisdom can rise
no higher: and the reason why idol worship was forbidden
in the divine law, was not because of the erroneous
ideas of the original institutors, but because the views
of the vulgar, in process of time, are apt to stop short
at the intermediate object, and to lose sight of the original
invisible Essence. But the great crime of idolatrous
nations consisted in their ascribing to the Deity
the passions and attributes of the Devil, and in the
horrid and murtherous rites of their worship. Mankind
are more inclined to consider the Deity as a God
of vengeance than a God of mercy. Even among
christians most persons ascribe afflictions to the hand
of Heaven and prosperity to their own merit and
prudence. This principle operates in its full effect
among savages. They usually form no idea of a general
superintending Providence; they consider not
the Deity as the author of their beings, the Creator of
the world and the dispenser of the happiness they enjoy;
they discern him not in the usual course of nature,
in the sunshine and in the shower, the productions of
the earth and the blessing of society; they find a Deity
only in the storm, the earthquake and the whirlwind;
or ascribe to him the evils of pestilence and famine;
they consider him as interposing in wrath to
change the course of nature, and exercising the attributes
of rage and revenge. They adore him with
rites suited to these attributes, with horror, with penance
and with sacrifice; they imagine him pleased
with the severity of their mortifications, with the oblations
of blood and the cries of human victims; and
hope to compound for greater judgements, by voluntary
sufferings and horrid sacrifices, suited to the relish
of his taste.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">Perhaps</hi> no single criterion can be given, which
<pb n="89">
will determine more accurately the state of society
in any age or nation, than their general ideas concerning
the nature and attributes of the Deity. In the
most enlightened periods of antiquity, only a very few
of their wisest Philosophers, a Socrates, a Tully, or a
Confucius, ever formed a just idea on the subject, or
described the Deity as a God of purity, justice and benevolence.
Can any thing then be more astonishing
than to view a savage native of the southern wilds of
America, rising in an age, void of every trace of learning
or refinement, and acquiring by the mere efforts of
reason, a sublime and rational idea of the Parent of
the universe!</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">He</hi> taught the nation to consider him as the God
of order and regularity; ascribing to his influence the
rotation of the seasons, the productions of the earth
and the blessings of health; especially attributing to
his inspiration the wisdom of their laws and that happy
constitution, which was the delight and veneration
of the people.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">These</hi> humane ideas of religion had a sensible operation
upon the manners of the nation. They never
began an offensive war with their savage neighbours;
and, whenever their country was invaded, they made
war, not to extirpate, but to civilize. The conquered
tribes and those taken captive were adopted into the
nation; and, by blending with the conquerors, forgot
their former rage and ferocity.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">A system</hi> so just and benevolent, as might be expected,
was attended with success. In about three
hundred years, the dominions of the Incas had extended
fifteen hundred miles in length, and had introduced
peace and prosperity through the whole region.
<pb n="90">
The arts of society had been carried to a considerable
degree of improvement, and the authority of
the Incan race universally acknowledged; when an event
happened, that disturbed the tranquility of the
empire. Huana Capac, the twelfth monarch, had
reduced the powerful kingdom of Quito, and annexed
it to his empire. To conciliate the affections of his
new subjects, he married a daughter of the ancient
king of Quito. Thus, by violating a fundamental law
of the Incas, he left at his death a disputed succession
to the throne. Atabalipa, the son of Huana by the
heiress of Quito, being in possession of the principal
force of the Peruvian armies, which was left at that
place on the death of his father, gave battle to his
brother Huascar, who was the elder son of Huana by
a lawful wife, and legal heir to the crown. After a
long and destructive civil war, the former was victorious;
and thus was that flourishing and happy kingdom
left a prey to civil dissentions, and to the few
soldiers of Pizarro, who happened at that juncture to
make a discent upon their coast. Thus he effected an
easy conquest and an utter destruction of that unfortunate
people. It is however extremely obvious, that
this deplorable event is not to be charged on Capac,
as the consequence of any defect in his institution. It
is impossible that any original legislator should effectually
guard against the folly of a futute sovereign.
Capac had not only removed every temptation that
could induce a wise prince to wish for a change in the
constitution, but had connected the ruin of his authority
with the change; for he, who disregards any part
of institutions deemed sacred, teaches his people to
consider the whole as an imposture. Had he made
a law ordaining that the Peruvians should be absolved
from their allegiance to a prince, who should violate
the laws; it would evidently have implied possible error
and imperfection in those persons whom the people
<pb n="91">
were ordered to regard as Divinities: the reverence
due to characters who made such high pretensions,
would have been weakened; and, instead of rendering
the constitution perfect, such a law would have been
its greatest defect. Besides, it is probable the rupture
might have been healed, and the succession settled,
with as little difficulty as frequently happens with
partial revolutions in other kingdoms; had not the descent
of the Spaniards prevented. And this event to
a man in that age and country, was totally beyond the
possibility of human foresight. But viewing the concurrence
of these fatal accidents, which reduced this
flourishing empire to a level with many other ruined
and departed kingdoms, it only proves that no human
system has the privilege to be perfect.</p>
<p><hi r="smcap">On</hi> the whole, it is evident, that the system of Capac
is the most surprizing exertion of human genius
to be found in the history of mankind. When we
consider him as an individual emerging from the midst
of a barbarous people, having seen no possible example
of the operation of laws in any country, originating
a plan of religion and policy never equalled by the
sages of antiquity, civilizing an extensive empire, and
rendering religion and government subservient to the
general happiness of mankind, there is no danger that
we grow too warm in his praise, or pronounce too
high an eulogium on his character. Had such a genius
appeared in Greece or Rome, he had been the
subject of universal admiration; had he arisen in the
favourite land of Turkey, his praises had filled a
thousand pages in the diffusive writings of Voltaire.</p></note></div3>

It is evident, that, not only the island of Newfoundland, Cape&hyphen;Cod, &amp;c. but the greater part of the settled country, from the river Delaware to Cape St. Augustine, is an accretion of earth worn off from the Isthmus of Darien, by that strong current of water which follows the trade winds; and, meeting the obstruction of the Isthmus, takes a northern direction and sweeps the coast, as far as the river St. Laurence.</note> and raised the extended clime;</l>

<pdiv><l ln="431    ">Thus haughty baronies their terrors spread,</l>

<l ln="4        ">Their course adventurous o'er the distant tide.</l>
<l ln="5        ">Thus, when o'er deluged earth her Seraph stood,</l>
<l ln="6        ">The tost ark bounding on the shoreless flood,</l>
<l ln="7        ">The sacred treasure claim'd his guardian view,</l>
<l ln="8        ">While climes unnoticed in the wave withdrew.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="9        ">He saw the squadrons reach the rising strand,</l>

<l ln="11      ">Receding forests yield the heroes room,</l>
<l ln="12      ">And opening wilds with fields and gardens bloom.</l>
<l ln="13      ">Fill'd with the glance extatic, all his soul</l>
<l ln="14      ">Now seems unbounded with the scene to roll,</l>
<l ln="15      ">And now, impatient, with retorted eye,</l>
<l ln="16      ">Perceives his station in another sky.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="17      ">Waft me, O winged Angel, waft me o'er,</l>

<pdiv><l ln="25      ">The hero spoke; the Angel's powerful hand</l>
<l ln="26      ">Moves brightening o'er the visionary land;</l>
<l ln="27      ">The height, that bore them, still sublimer grew,</l>
<l ln="28      ">And earth's whole circuit settled from their view:</l>
<l ln="29      ">A dusky Deep, serene as breathless even,</l>
<l ln="30      ">Seem'd vaulting downward, like another heaven;</l>
<l ln="31      ">The sun, rejoicing on his western way,</l>
<l ln="32      ">Stamp'd his fair image in the inverted day:</l>

<l ln="73      ">Fair babes and matrons in their domes expire,</l>
<l ln="74      ">Or burst their passage thro' the folding fire;</l>
<l ln="75      ">O'er woods and plains, promiscuous rave along</l>
<l ln="76      ">The yelling victors and the driven throng;</l>
<pb n="154">

<l ln="80      ">Exalt the standard and oppose the war,</l>

<l ln="82      ">And brave the shafted terrors of the bow.</l>
<l ln="83      ">When, like a broken wave, the savage train</l>
<l ln="84      ">Lead back the flight and scatter o'er the plain,</l>
<l ln="85      ">Slay their weak captives, leave their shafts in haste,</l>
<l ln="86      ">Forget their spoils and scour the distant waste.</l>
<l ln="87      ">As, when the morning sun begins his way,</l>

<l ln="89      ">So the dark tribes, from brighter regions hurl'd,</l>
<l ln="90      ">Sweep o'er the heights and lakes, far thro' the wilder'd world.</l></pdiv>

<pdiv><l ln="17      ">Then o'er the eastern world he turn'd his eye;</l>

<l ln="371    ">The fleecy vapors thro' the expansion run,</l>
<l ln="372    ">Veil the blue vault and tremble o'er the sun;</l>

part of the seventh Book, was written previous to the conclusion of
the late war) the Author is happy to find that his general ideas, respecting
the future progress and final perfection of human society, are
supported by those of so respectable a Character as Dr. Price. In
his Observations on the Importance of the American Revolution,
he remarks, &ldquo;That Reason, as well as Tradition and Revelation,
lead us to expect that a more improved and happy state of human
affairs will take place before the final consummation of all
things. The world has been hitherto gradually improving;
light and knowledge have been gaining ground, and human life
at present, compared with what it <hi r="italic">once</hi> was, is much the same
that a youth approaching to manhood is, compared with an infant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has long been the opinion of the Author, that such a state of
peace and happiness as is foretold in scripture and commonly called
the millennial period, may be rationally expected to be introduced
without a miracle. <hi r="italic">Nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus</hi>, is a
maxim, as useful to a Christian Philosopher as to a Heathen Poet.
Although, from the history of mankind, it appears, that the progress
of improvement has been slow and often interrupted, yet it
gives pleasure to observe the causes of these interruptions, and to
discern the end they were designed in the course of Providence to
answer, in accelerating the same events, which they seemed for awhile
to retard. The state of the arts among the ancients, viewed
with reference to the event under consideration, was faulty or rather
unfortunate in two particulars; <hi r="italic">first</hi>, in their comparative estimation;
and <hi r="italic">secondly</hi>, in their not flourishing in more than one
nation at a time. These circumstances were highly favourable to
the exertions of individual genius, and may be assigned both as
causes of the universal destruction of the arts by the Gothic conquest,
and as reasons why we should not greatly lament that destruction.
From the situation of mankind in the days of ancient literature,
it was natural that those arts which depend on the imagination, such
as Architecture, Statuary, Painting, Eloquence and Poetry, should
claim the highest rank in the estimation of a people. In several,
and perhaps all of these, the ancients remain unrivaled. But
these are not the arts which tend greatly to the general improvement
of mankind. The man, who in those days could have ascertained
the true figure of the earth, would have rendered more service
to the world, than he that could originate a heaven and fill it
with all the Gods of Homer; and had the expences of the Egyptian
pyramids been employed in furnishing fleets of discovery, to be sent
out of the Mediterranian, the civilized world would probably
never have been overrun by Barbarians. But the sciences of Geography
Navigation and Commerce, with all their consequential
improvements in natural philosophy and humanity, could not, from
the nature of things, be objects of great encouragement or enterprize
among the ancients. They therefore turned their attention
to the cultivation of arts more striking to the senses; such as require
the strongest exertion of the human genius, and would be entitled
to the highest rank in any age of universal refinement. As
these arts were adapted to gratify the vanity of a prince, to fire the
ambition of a hero, or to gain a point in a popular assembly, they
were carried to a degree of perfection, which prevented their being
relished or understood by barbarians. The literature of the world
therefore descended with the line of conquest from one nation to
another, till the whole was swallowed up in the Roman Empire.
There its tendency was to inspire a contempt for nations less civilized,
and to induce the Romans to consider all mankind as the
objects of their insult, and all countries as the scenes of their military
parade. These circumstances, through a course of ages, prepared
and finally opened a scene of wretchedness, at which the human
mind has been taught to shudder, but it was wisely calculated to
reduce mankind to a situation, capable of commencing regular and
extensive improvements. And, however novel the sentiment may
appear, yet the Author will venture to assert, that, as to the prospect
of universal civilization, mankind were in a much more eligible
situation in the time of Charlemagne than they were in the days
of Augustus. The final destruction of the Roman empire left the
nations of Europe in circumstances similar to each other; and their
consequent rivalship prevented any disproportionate refinement
from appearing in any particular region. The seeds of government,
firmly rooted in the principles of the feudal system, laid the
foundation of that balance of Power, which discourages the C&aelig;sars
and Alexanders of mankind from attempting the conquest of the
world.</p>
<p>It seems necessary, that the arrangement of events in civilizing
the world should be in the following order. <hi r="italic">First</hi>, all parts of it
must be considerably peopled; <hi r="italic">secondly</hi>, the different nations must
be known to each other; and <hi r="italic">thirdly</hi>, their imaginary wants must be
increased, in order to inspire a passion for commerce. The first of
these objects, was probably not accomplished till a late period. The
second, for three centuries past, has been greatly accelerated, but is
now very far from being completely obtained. The third is always
a necessary consequence of the two former. The spirit of
commerce is happily calculated by the Author of wisdom to open
an amicable intercourse between all countries, to soften the horrors
of war, to enlarge the field of science and speculation, and to assimilate
the manners, feelings and languages of all nations. This
leading principle, in its remoter consequences, will produce a thousand
advantages in favour of government and legislation, give Patriotism
the air of Philanthropy, induce all men to regard each other
as brethren and friends, eradicate all kinds of literary, religious
and political superstition, prepare the minds of all mankind for the
rational reception of moral and religious truth, and finally evince
that such a system of Providence, as appears in the unfolding of
these events, is the best possible system to produce the happiness of
creatures. I conceive it is no objection to this plan, that the progress
has hitherto been slow; when we consider the vast magnitude
of the object, the obstructions to be removed, and the great length
of time that will probably be taken to accomplish it. To resume
the comparison of Doctor Price, perhaps the world can hardly be
said as yet to be &ldquo;approaching to manhood&rdquo;; probably we are
rather rising out of infancy; we have not yet been able to wander
over the whole house and observe upon the furniture. It is possible
that some considerable revolutions are yet to happen, before the
progress will be entirely free from embarrasments. But the general
system appears so rational and complete, that it furnishes a new
source of satisfaction, in contemplating the apparent dispensations
of Heaven.</p>
<p>The author first ventured upon these ideas, in the course of the
Poem, with all the timidity of youth; determining not to risk a serious
illustration of the sentiment in prose. But finding that a theory
so pleasing to himself has not been unnoticed by others, he feels
a greater confidence in the subject, and hopes the importance of it
will apologize to the reader for so lengthy a note.</p></note> And one wide interest sways the peaceful race.</l></pdiv>

<pdiv><l ln="355    ">Such views, the Power replies, would drown thy sight,</l>
<l ln="356    ">And seal thy visions in eternal night;</l>
<l ln="357    ">Nor Heaven permits, nor Angels can display</l>
<l ln="358    ">The unborn glories of that blissful day.</l>
<l ln="359    ">Enough for thee, that thy delighted mind,</l>
<l ln="360    ">Should trace the deeds and blessings of thy kind;</l>
<l ln="361    ">That time's descending vale should ope so far,</l>
<l ln="362    ">Beyond the reach of wretchedness and war;</l>
<l ln="363    ">Till all the paths in Heaven's extended plan,</l>
<l ln="364    ">Fair in thy view should lead the steps of man;</l>
<l ln="365    ">To form, at last, in earth's benighted ball,</l>
<l ln="366    ">Union of parts and happiness of all.</l>
<l ln="367    ">To thy glad view these rolling scenes have shown,</l>
<l ln="368    ">What boundless blessings thy vast labours crown;</l>
<pb n="255">
<l ln="369    ">That, with the joys of unborn ages blest,</l>
<l ln="370    ">Thy soul, exulting, may retire to rest,</l>
<l ln="371    ">And find, in regions of unclouded day,</l>
<l ln="372    ">What heaven's bright walks and endless years display.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="373    ">Behold, once more, around the earth and sky,</l>
<l ln="374    ">The last glad visions wait thy raptured eye.</l>
<l ln="375    ">The great Observer look'd; the land and sea,</l>
<l ln="376    ">In solemn grandeur, stretch'd beneath him, lay;</l>
<l ln="377    ">Here swell the mountains, there the oceans roll,</l>
<l ln="378    ">And beams of beauty kindle round the pole.</l>
<l ln="379    ">O'er all the range, where coasts and climes extend,</l>
<l ln="380    ">In glorious pomp the works of peace ascend.</l>
<l ln="381    ">Robed in the bloom of spring's eternal year,</l>
<l ln="382    ">And ripe with fruits, the same glad fields appear,</l>
<l ln="383    ">On each long strand unnumber'd cities run,</l>
<l ln="384    ">Bend their bright walls and sparkle to the sun;</l>
<l ln="385    ">The streams, all freighted from the bounteous plain,</l>
<l ln="386    ">Swell with the load and labour to the main;</l>
<l ln="387    ">Where widening waves command a bolder gale,</l>
<l ln="388    ">And prop the pinions of a broader sail:</l>
<l ln="389    ">Sway'd with the floating weight, the ocean toils,</l>
<l ln="390    ">And joyous nature's last perfection smiles.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="391    ">Now, fair beneath his view, the important age</l>
<l ln="392    ">Leads the bold actors on a broader stage;</l>
<l ln="393    ">When, clothed majestic in the robes of state,</l>
<l ln="394    ">Moved by one voice, in general council meet</l>
<l ln="395    ">The fathers of all empires: 'twas the place,</l>
<l ln="396    ">Near the first footsteps of the human race;</l>
<pb n="256">
<l ln="397    ">Where wretched men, first wandering from their God,</l>
<l ln="398    ">Began their feuds and led their tribes abroad.</l>
<l ln="399    ">In this mid region, this delightful clime,</l>
<l ln="400    ">Rear'd by whole realms, to brave the wrecks of time,</l>
<l ln="401    ">A spacious structure rose, sublimely great,</l>
<l ln="402    ">The last resort, the unchanging scene of state.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="403    ">On rocks of adamant the walls ascend,</l>
<l ln="404    ">Tall columns heave, and Parian arches bend;</l>
<l ln="405    ">High o'er the golden roofs, the rising spires,</l>
<l ln="406    ">Far in the concave meet the solar fires;</l>
<l ln="407    ">Four blazing fronts, with gates unfolding high,</l>
<l ln="408    ">Look, with immortal splendor, round the sky:</l>
<l ln="409    ">Hither the delegated sires ascend,</l>
<l ln="410    ">And all the cares of every clime attend.</l>
<l ln="411    ">As the fair first&hyphen;born messengers of heaven,</l>
<l ln="412    ">To whom the care of stars and suns is given,</l>
<l ln="413    ">When the last circuit of their winding spheres</l>
<l ln="414    ">Hath finish'd time and mark'd their sum of years,</l>
<l ln="415    ">From all the bounds of space (their labours done)</l>
<l ln="416    ">Shall wing their triumphs to the eternal throne;</l>
<l ln="417    ">Each, from his far dim sky, illumes the road,</l>
<l ln="418    ">And sails and centres tow'rd the mount of God;</l>
<l ln="419    ">There, in mid heaven, their honour'd seats to spread,</l>
<l ln="420    ">And ope the untarnish'd volumes of the dead:</l>
<l ln="421    ">So, from all climes of earth, where nations rise,</l>
<l ln="422    ">Or lands or oceans bound the incumbent skies,</l>
<l ln="423    ">Wing'd with unwonted speed, the gathering throng</l>
<l ln="424    ">In ships and chariots, shape their course along;</l>
<pb n="257">
<l ln="425    ">Till, wide o'er earth and sea, they win their way,</l>
<l ln="426    ">Where the bold structure flames against the day;</l>
<l ln="427    ">There, hail the splendid seat by Heaven assign'd,</l>
<l ln="428    ">To hear and give the counsels of mankind.</l>
<l ln="429    ">Now the dread concourse, in the ample dome,</l>
<l ln="430    ">Pour thro' the arches and their seats assume;</l>
<l ln="431    ">Far as the extended eye can range around,</l>
<l ln="432    ">Or the deep trumpet's solemn voice resound,</l>
<l ln="433    ">Long rows of reverend sires, sublime, extend,</l>
<l ln="434    ">And cares of worlds on every brow suspend.</l>
<l ln="435    ">High in the front, for manlier virtues known,</l>
<l ln="436    ">A sire elect, in peerless grandeur, shone;</l>
<l ln="437    ">And rising oped the universal cause,</l>
<l ln="438    ">To give each realm its limit and its laws;</l>
<l ln="439    ">Bid the last breath of dire contention cease,</l>
<l ln="440    ">And bind all regions in the leagues of peace,</l>
<l ln="441    ">Bid one great empire, with extensive sway,</l>
<l ln="442    ">Spread with the sun and bound the walks of day,</l>
<l ln="443    ">One centred system, one all&hyphen;ruling soul,</l>
<l ln="444    ">Live thro' the parts, and regulate the whole.</l></pdiv>
<pdiv><l ln="445    ">Here, said the Angel with a blissful smile,</l>
<l ln="446    ">Behold the fruits of thy unwearied toil.</l>
<l ln="447    ">To yon far regions of descending day,</l>
<l ln="448    ">Thy swelling pinions led the untrodden way,</l>
<l ln="449    ">And taught mankind adventurous deeds to dare,</l>
<l ln="450    ">To trace new seas and peaceful empires rear;</l>
<l ln="451    ">Hence, round the globe, their rival sails, unfurl'd,</l>
<l ln="452    ">Have waved, at last, in union o'er the world.</l>
<pb n="258">
<l ln="453    ">Let thy delighted soul no more complain,</l>
<l ln="454    ">Of dangers braved and griefs endured in vain,</l>
<l ln="455    ">Of courts insidious, envy's poison'd stings,</l>
<l ln="456    ">The loss of empire and the frown of kings;</l>
<l ln="457    ">While these bright scenes thy glowing thoughts compose,</l>
<l ln="458    ">To spurn the vengeance of insulting foes;</l>
<l ln="459    ">And all the joys, descending ages gain,</l>
<l ln="460    ">Repay thy labours and remove thy pain.</l></pdiv></div3>
