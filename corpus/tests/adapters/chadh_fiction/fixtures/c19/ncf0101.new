<p><pp><smallcap>On</smallcap> the night of Friday, the 26th of November,
1703, and at the hour of eleven, the door
of a miserable habitation, situated in an obscure
quarter of the Borough of Southwark, known
as the Old Mint, was opened; and a man, with
a lantern in his hand, appeared at the threshold.
This person, whose age might be about forty,
was attired in a brown double&hyphen;breasted frieze
coat, with very wide skirts, and a very narrow
collar; a light drugget waistcoat, with pockets
reaching to the knees; black plush breeches; 
grey worsted hose; and shoes with round toes,
wooden heels, and high quarters, fastened by
small silver buckles. He wore a three&hyphen;cornered
hat, a sandy&hyphen;coloured scratch wig, and had a
thick woollen wrapper folded round his throat.</pp>
<pb n="2">
<pp>His clothes had evidently seen some service,
and were plentifully begrimed with the dust of
the workshop. Still he had a decent look, and
decidedly the air of one well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do in the world.
In stature, he was short and stumpy; in person,
corpulent; and in countenance, sleek,
snub&hyphen;nosed, and demure.</pp></p>
<p>Immediately behind this individual, came a
pale, poverty&hyphen;stricken woman, whose forlorn
aspect contrasted strongly with his plump and
comfortable physiognomy. She was dressed in
a tattered black stuff gown, discoloured by
various stains, and intended, it would seem,
from the remnants of rusty crape with which it
was here and there tricked out, to represent the
garb of widowhood, and held in her arms a
sleeping infant, swathed in the folds of a linsey&hyphen;woolsey
shawl.</p>
<p><pp>Notwithstanding her emaciation, her features
still retained something of a pleasing expression,
and might have been termed beautiful, had
it not been for that repulsive freshness of lip
denoting the habitual dram&hyphen;drinker; a freshness</pp>
<pb n="3">
<pp>in her case rendered the more shocking
from the almost livid hue of the rest of her
complexion. She could not be more than
twenty; and though want and other suffering
had done the work of time, had wasted her
frame, and robbed her cheek of its bloom and
roundness, they had not extinguished the lustre
of her eyes, nor thinned her raven hair. Checking
an ominous cough, that, ever and anon, convulsed
her lungs, the poor woman addressed a
few parting words to her companion, who lingered
at the doorway as if he had something on
his mind, which he did not very well know how
to communicate.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good night, Mr. Wood,&rdquo; said she, in
the deep, hoarse accents of consumption; &ldquo;and
may God Almighty bless and reward you for
your kindness! You were always the best of
masters to my poor husband; and now you've
proved the best of friends to his widow and orphan
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Poh! poh! say no more about it,&rdquo; rejoined
the man hastily. &ldquo;I've done no more than my</pp>
<pb n="4">
<pp>duty, Mrs. Sheppard, and neither deserve nor
desire your thanks. &lsquo;Whoso giveth to the
poor lendeth to the Lord;&rsquo; that's my comfort.
And such slight relief as I can afford should
have been offered earlier, if I'd known where
you'd taken refuge after your unfortunate
husband's&wblank;&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Execution, you would say, sir,&rdquo; added
Mrs. Sheppard, with a deep sigh, perceiving
that her benefactor hesitated to pronounce the
word. &ldquo;You show more consideration to the
feelings of a hempen widow, than there is any
need to show. I'm used to insult as I am to
misfortune, and am grown callous to both; but
I'm <it>not</it> used to compassion, and know not how
to take it. My heart would speak if it could,
for it is very full. There was a time, long,
long ago, when the tears would have rushed to
my eyes unbidden at the bare mention of generosity
like yours, Mr. Wood; but they never
come now. I have never wept since that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;And I trust you will never have occasion
to weep again, my poor soul,&rdquo; replied Wood,
setting down his lantern, and brushing a few</pp>
<pb n="5">
<pp>drops from his eyes, &ldquo;unless it be tears of joy.
Pshaw!&rdquo; added he, making an effort to subdue
his emotion, &ldquo;I can't leave you in this way. I
must stay a minute longer, if only to see you
smile.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>So saying, he re&hyphen;entered the house, closed
the door, and, followed by the widow, proceeded
to the fire&hyphen;place, where a handful of
chips, apparently just lighted, crackled within
the rusty grate.</p>
<p><pp>The room in which this interview took place
had a sordid and miserable look. Rotten, and
covered with a thick coat of dirt, the boards of
the floor presented a very insecure footing; the
bare walls were scored all over with grotesque
designs, the chief of which represented the
punishment of Nebuchadnezzar. The rest were
hieroglyphic characters, executed in red chalk
and charcoal. The ceiling had, in many places,
given way; the laths had been removed; and,
where any plaster remained, it was either
mapped and blistered with damps, or festooned
with dusty cobwebs. Over an old crazy bedstead
was thrown a squalid, patchwork counterpane;</pp>
<pb n="6">
<pp>and upon the counterpane lay a black
hood and scarf, a pair of bodice of the cumbrous
form in vogue at the beginning of the
last century, and some other articles of female
attire. On a small shelf near the foot of the
bed stood a couple of empty phials, a cracked
ewer and basin, a brown jug without a handle,
a small tin coffee&hyphen;pot without a spout, a saucer
of rouge, a fragment of looking&hyphen;glass, and a
flask, labelled &ldquo;<it>Rosa Solis.</it>&rdquo; Broken pipes
littered the floor, if that can be said to be littered,
which, in the first instance, was a mass of
squalor and filth.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Over the chimney&hyphen;piece was pasted a handbill,
purporting to be &ldquo;<it>The last Dying Speech
and Confession of</it> TOM SHEPPARD, <it>the
Notorious Housebreaker, who suffered at Tyburn
on the 25th of February</it>, 1703.&rdquo; This
placard was adorned with a rude wood&hyphen;cut,
representing the unhappy malefactor at the
place of execution. On one side of the handbill
a print of the reigning sovereign, Anne,
had been pinned over the portrait of William
the Third, whose aquiline nose, keen eyes,</pp>
<pb n="7">
<pp>and luxuriant wig, were just visible above
the diadem of the queen. On the other a
wretched engraving of the Chevalier de Saint
George, or, as he was styled in the label attached
to the portrait, James the Third, raised
a suspicion that the inmate of the house was
not altogether free from some tincture of
Jacobitism.</pp></p>
<p>Beneath these prints, a cluster of hobnails,
driven into the wall, formed certain letters,
which, if properly deciphered, produced the
words, &ldquo;<it>Paul Groves, cobler</it>;&rdquo; and under the
name, traced in charcoal, appeared the following
record of the poor fellow's fate, &ldquo;<it>Hung
himsel in this rum for luv off licker</it>;&rdquo; accompanied
by a graphic sketch of the unhappy
suicide dangling from a beam. A farthing
candle, stuck in a bottle neck, shed its feeble
light upon the table, which, owing to the provident
kindness of Mr. Wood, was much
better furnished with eatables than might
have been expected, and boasted a loaf, a
knuckle of ham, a meat&hyphen;pie, and a flask of
wine.</p>
<pb n="8">
<p>&ldquo;You've but a sorry lodging, Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; 
said Wood, glancing round the chamber,
as he expanded his palms before the
scanty flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's wretched enough, indeed, sir,&rdquo; rejoined
the widow; &ldquo;but, poor as it is, it's
better than the cold stones and open streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;of course,&rdquo; returned Wood,
hastily; &ldquo;anything's better than that. But
take a drop of wine,&rdquo; urged he, filling a drinking&hyphen;horn
and presenting it to her; &ldquo;it's choice
canary, and 'll do you good. And now, come
and sit by me, my dear, and let's have a little
quiet chat together. When things are at the
worst, they'll mend. Take my word for it,
your troubles are over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they are, sir,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Sheppard,
with a faint smile and a doubtful shake
of the head, as Wood drew her to a seat beside
him, &ldquo;for I've had my full share of misery.
But I don't look for peace on this side the
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Wood; &ldquo;while there's
life there's hope. Never be down&hyphen;hearted.</pp>
<pb n="9">
<pp>Besides,&rdquo; added he, opening the shawl in
which the infant was wrapped, and throwing
the light of the candle full upon its sickly,
but placid features, &ldquo;it's sinful to repine
while you've a child like this to comfort you.
Lord help him! he's the very image of his
father. Like carpenter, like chips.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That likeness is the chief cause of my misery,&rdquo; 
replied the widow, shuddering. &ldquo;Were
it not for that, he would indeed be a blessing
and a comfort to me. He never cries nor frets,
as children generally do, but lies at my bosom,
or on my knee, as quiet and as gentle as you
see him now. But, when I look upon his
innocent face, and see how like he is to his
father,&mdash;when I think of that father's shameful
ending, and recollect how free from guilt
<it>he</it> once was,&mdash;at such times, Mr. Wood, despair
will come over me; and, dear as this
babe is to me, far dearer than my own wretched
life, which I would lay down for him any
minute, I have prayed to Heaven to remove
him, rather than he should grow up to be a
man, and be exposed to his father's temptations</pp>
<pb n="10">
<pp>&mdash;rather than he should live as wickedly and
die as disgracefully as his father. And, when
I have seen him pining away before my eyes,
getting thinner and thinner every day, I have
sometimes thought my prayers were heard.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage and hanging go by destiny,&rdquo; 
observed Wood, after a pause; &ldquo;but I trust
your child is reserved for a better fate than
either, Mrs. Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter part of this speech was delivered
with so much significance of manner, that a
by&hyphen;stander might have inferred that Mr. Wood
was not particularly fortunate in his own matrimonial
connections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness only knows what he's reserved
for,&rdquo; rejoined the widow in a desponding tone; 
&ldquo;but if Mynheer Van Galgebrok, whom I
met last night at the Cross Shovels, spoke
the truth, little Jack will never die in his
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save us!&rdquo; exclaimed Wood. &ldquo;And who
is this Van Gal&mdash;Gal&mdash;what's his outlandish
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Van Galgebrok,&rdquo; replied the widow.</pp>
<pb n="11">
<pp>&ldquo;He's the famous Dutch conjuror who foretold
King William's accident and death, last
February but one, a month before either event
happened, and gave out that another prince
over the water would soon enjoy his own
again; for which he was committed to Newgate,
and whipped at the cart's tail. He
went by another name then,&mdash;Rykhart Scherprechter
I think he called himself. His fellow&hyphen;prisoners
nicknamed him the gallows&hyphen;provider,
from a habit he had of picking out all
those who were destined to the gibbet. He
was never known to err, and was as much
dreaded as the gaol&hyphen;fever in consequence. He
singled out my poor husband from a crowd
of other felons; and you know how right he
was in that case, sir.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Ay, marry,&rdquo; replied Wood, with a look
that seemed to say that he did not think it
required any surprising skill in the art of
divination to predict the doom of the individual
in question; but whatever opinion he
might entertain, he contented himself with
inquiring into the grounds of the conjuror's</pp>
<pb n="12">
<pp>evil augury respecting the infant. &ldquo;What
did the old fellow judge from, eh, Joan?&rdquo; 
asked he.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;From a black mole under the child's right
ear, shaped like a coffin, which is a bad sign; 
and a deep line just above the middle of the
left thumb, meeting round about in the form of
a noose, which is a worse,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard.
&ldquo;To be sure, it's not surprising the poor
little think should be so marked; for, when I
lay in the women&hyphen;felons' ward in Newgate,
where he first saw the light, or at least such
light as ever finds entrance into that gloomy
place, I had nothing, whether sleeping or waking,
but halters, and gibbets, and coffins, and
such like horrible visions, for ever dancing
round me! And then, you know, sir&mdash;but,
perhaps, you don't know that little Jack was
born, a month before his time, on the very day
his poor father suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless us!&rdquo; ejaculated Wood, &ldquo;how
shocking! No, I did <it>not</it> know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may see the marks on the child yourself,
if you choose, sir,&rsquo; urged the widow.</p>
<pb n="13">
<p>&ldquo;See the devil!&mdash;not I,&rdquo; cried Wood impatiently.
&ldquo;I didn't think you'd been so
easily fooled, Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fooled or not,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Sheppard
mysteriously, &ldquo;old Van told me <it>one</it> thing
which has come true already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Wood with some
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, by way of comfort, I suppose,
after the fright have gave me at first, that the
child would find a friend within twenty&hyphen;four
hours, who would stand by him through life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend is not so soon gained as lost,&rdquo; 
replied Wood; &ldquo;but how has the prediction
been fulfilled, Joan, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would have guessed, sir,&rdquo; 
replied the widow, timidly. &ldquo;I'm sure little
Jack has but one friend beside myself, in the
world, and that's more than I would have ventured
to say for him yesterday. However,
I've not told you all; for old Van <it>did</it> say
something about the child saving his newfound
friend's life at the time of meeting; but
how that's to happen, I'm sure I can't guess.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="14">
<p>&ldquo;Nor any one else in his senses,&rdquo; rejoined
Wood, with a laugh. &ldquo;It's not very likely
that a babby of nine months old will save <it>my</it>
life, if I'm to be his friend, as you seem to
say, Mrs. Sheppard. But I've not promised
to stand by him yet; nor will I, unless he
turns out an honest lad,&mdash;mind that. Of all
crafts,&mdash;and it was the only craft his poor
father, who, to do him justice, was one of the
best workmen that ever handled a saw or drove
a nail, could never understand,&mdash;of all crafts, I
say, to be an honest man is the master&hyphen;craft.
As long as your son observes that precept I'll
befriend him, but no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't desire it, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard,
meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's an old proverb,&rdquo; continued Wood,
rising and walking towards the fire &ldquo;which
says,&mdash;&lsquo;Put another man's child in your
bosom, and he'll creep out at your elbow.&rsquo; 
But I don't value that, because I think it
applies to one who marries a widow with incumbrances; 
and that's not my case, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>393Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010102">
<pb n="15">
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, I've a proposal to make
in regard to this babby of yours, which may,
or may not, be agreeable. All I can say is, it's
well meant; and I may add, I'd have made
it five minutes ago, if you'd given me the
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray come to the point, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Sheppard, somewhat alarmed by this preamble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>am</it> coming to the point, Joan. The
more haste, the worse speed&mdash;better the feet
slip than the tongue. However, to cut a long
matter short, my proposal's this:&mdash;I've taken
a fancy to your bantling, and, as I've no son
of my own, if it meets with your concurrence
and that of Mrs. Wood, (for I never do anything
without consulting my better half,) I'll
take the boy, educate him, and bring him up
to my own business of a carpenter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor widow hung her head, and pressed
her child closer to her breast.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, Joan,&rdquo; said the benevolent mechanic,
after he had looked of her steadfastly for a</pp>
<pb n="16">
<pp>few moments, &ldquo;what say you?&mdash;silence gives
consent, eh?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard made an effort to speak, but
her voice was choked by emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I take the babby home with me?&rdquo; 
persisted Wood, in a tone between jest and
earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot part with him,&rdquo; replied the widow,
bursting into tears; &ldquo;indeed, indeed, I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I've found out the way to move her,&rdquo; 
thought the carpenter; &ldquo;those tears will do
her some good, at all events. Not part with
him!&rdquo; added he aloud. &ldquo;Why, you wouldn't
stand in the way of his good fortune surely?
I'll be a second father to him, I tell you.
Remember what the conjuror said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>do</it> remember it, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard,
&ldquo;and am most grateful for your offer.
But I dare not accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear not!&rdquo; echoed the carpenter; &ldquo;I don't
understand you, Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I mean to say, sir,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Sheppard
in a troubled voice, &ldquo;that if I lost my</pp>
<pb n="17">
<pp>child, I should lose all I have left in the world.
I have neither father, mother, brother, sister,
nor husband&mdash;I have only <it>him.</it>&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ask you to part with him, my good
woman, it's to better his condition. I suppose,
and't it?&rdquo; rejoined Wood angrily; for, though
he had no serious intention of carrying his
proposal into effect, he was rather offended at
having it declined. &ldquo;It's not an offer,&rdquo; continued
he, &ldquo;that I'm likely to make, or you're
likely to receive every day in the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And muttering some remarks, which we do
not care to repeat, reflecting upon the consistency
of the sex, he was preparing once
more to depart, when Mrs. Sheppard stopped
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me till to&hyphen;morrow,&rdquo; implored she,
&ldquo;and if I <it>can</it> bring myself to part with him,
you shall have him without another word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take time to consider of it,&rdquo; replied Wood
sulkily, &ldquo;there's no hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Don't be angry with me, sir,&rdquo; cried the
widow, sobbing bitterly, &ldquo;pray don't. I know
I am undeserving of your bounty; but if I</pp>
<pb n="18">
<pp>were to tell you what hardships I have undergone&mdash;to
what frightful extremities I have
been reduced&mdash;and to what infamy I have submitted,
to earn a scanty subsistence for this
child's sake,&mdash;if you could feel what it is to
stand alone in the world as I do, bereft of
all who have ever loved me, and shunned by
all who have ever known me, except the
worthless and the wretched,&mdash;if you knew
(and Heaven grant you may be spared the
knowledge!) how much affliction sharpens
love, and how much more dear to me my
child has become for every sacrifice I have
made for him,&mdash;if you were told all this,
you would, I am sure, pity rather than reproach
me, because I cannot at once consent
to a separation, which I feel would break
my heart. But give me till to&hyphen;morrow&mdash;only
till to&hyphen;morrow&mdash;I may be able to part with
him then.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>The worthy carpenter was now far more
angry with himself than he had previously
been with Mrs. Sheppard; and, as soon as he
could command his feelings, which were considerably</pp>
<pb n="19">
<pp>excited by the mention of her distresses,
he squeezed her hand warmly, bestowed
a hearty execration upon his own inhumanity,
and swore he would neither separate
he from her child, nor suffer any one else
to separate them.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Plague on't!&rdquo; added he: &ldquo;I never meant
to take your babby from you. But I'd a
mind to try whether you really loved him as
much as you pretended. I was to blame to
carry the matter so far. However, confession
of a fault makes half amends for it. A time
<it>may</it> come when this little chap will need my
aid, and, depend upon it, he shall never want
a friend in Owen Wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>As he said this, the carpenter patted the
cheek of the little object of his benevolent
professions, and, in so doing, unintentionally
aroused him from his slumbers. Opening a
pair of large black eyes, the child fixed them
for an instant upon Wood, and then, alarmed
by the light, uttered a low and melancholy
cry, which, however, was speedily stilled by
the caresses of his mother, towards whom he</pp>
<pb n="20">
<pp>extended his tiny arms, as if imploring protection.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think he would leave me, even if
I could part with him,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Sheppard,
smiling through her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think he would,&rdquo; acquiesced the
carpenter. &ldquo;No friend like the mother, for
the babby knows no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that's true,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Sheppard; 
&ldquo;for if I had <it>not</it> been a mother, I would not
have survived the day on which I became a
widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn't think of that, Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; 
said Wood in a soothing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't help thinking of it, sir,&rdquo; answered
the widow. &ldquo;I can never get poor Tom's last
look out of my head, as he stood in the Stone&hyphen;Hall
at Newgate, after his irons had been
knocked off, unless I manage to stupify myself
somehow. The dismal tolling of St. Sepulchre's
bell is for ever ringing in my ears&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that's she case,&rdquo; observed Wood, &ldquo;I'm
surprised you should like to have such a
frightful picture constantly in view as that
over the chimney&hyphen;piece.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="21">
<p>&ldquo;I'd good reasons for placing it there, sir; 
but don't question me about them now, or
you'll drive me mad,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Sheppard
wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, we'll say no more about, it,&rdquo; 
replied Wood; &ldquo;and, by way of changing
the subject, let me advise you on no account
to fly to strong waters for consolation, Joan.
One nail drives out another, it's true; but
the worst nail you an employ is a coffinnail.
Gin Lane's the nearest road to the
churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It may be; but if it shortens the distance
and lightens the journey, I care not,&rdquo; retorted
the widow, who seemed by this reproach to
be roused into sudden eloquence. &ldquo;To those
who, like me, have never been able to get out
of the dark and dreary paths of life, the grave
is indeed a refuge, and the sooner they reach
it the better. The spirit I drink may be
poison,&mdash;it may kill me,&mdash;perhaps it <it>is</it> killing
me:&mdash;but so would hunger, cold, misery,
&mdash;so would my own thoughts. I should have
gone mad without it. Gin is the poor man's</pp>
<pb n="22">
<pp>friend,&mdash;his sole set&hyphen;off against the rich man's
luxury. It comforts him when he is most
forlorn. It may be treacherous, it may lay
up a store of future woe; but it insurers present
happiness, and that is sufficient. When
I have traversed the streets a houseless wanderer,
driven with curses from every door
where I have solicited alms, and with blows
from every gate&hyphen;way where I have sought
shelter,&mdash;when I have crept into some deserted
building, and stretched my wearied limbs
upon a bulk, in the vain hope of repose,&mdash; 
or, worse than all, when, frenzied with want,
I have yielded to horrible temptation, and
earned a meal in the only way I could earn
one,&mdash;when I have felt, at times like these,
my heart sink within me, I have drank of
this drink, and have at once forgotten my
cares, my poverty, my guilty. Old thoughts,
old feelings, old faces, and old scenes have
returned to me, and I have fancied myself
happy,&mdash;as happy as I am now.&rdquo; And she
burst into a wild hysterical laugh.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor creature!&rdquo; ejaculated Wood. &ldquo;Do
you call this frantic glee happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="23">
<p>&ldquo;It's all the happiness I have known for
years,&rdquo; returned the widow, becoming suddenly
calm, &ldquo;and it's short&hyphen;lived enough, as
you perceive. I tell you what, Mr. Wood,&rdquo; 
added she in a hollow voice, and with a ghastly
look, &ldquo;gin may bring ruin; but as long as
poverty, vice, and ill&hyphen;usage exist, it will be
drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed Wood, fervently; 
and, as if afraid of prolonging the interview,
he added, with some precipitation, &ldquo;But
I must be going: I've stayed here too long
already. You shall hear from me to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard, again arresting
his departure. &ldquo;I've just recollected that my
husband left a key with me, which he charged
me to give you when I could find an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A key!&rdquo; exclaimed Wood eagerly. &ldquo;I
lost a very valuable one some time ago.
What's it like, Joan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a small key, with curiously&hyphen;fashioned
wards.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It's mine, I'll be sworn,&rdquo; rejoined Wood.</pp>
<pb n="24">
<pp>&ldquo;Well, who'd have thought of finding it in
this unexpected way!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be too sure till you see it,&rdquo; said the
widow. &ldquo;Shall I fetch it for you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must trouble you to hold the child, then,
for a minute, while I run up to the garret,
where I've hidden it for safety,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Sheppard, &lsquo;I think I <it>may</it> trust him with
you, sir,&rdquo; added she, taking up the candle.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Don't leave him, if you're at all fearful,
my dear,&rdquo; replied Wood, receiving the little
burthen with a laugh. &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; muttered
he, as the widow departed on her errand,
&ldquo;she's seen better days and better circumstances
than she'll ever see again,&mdash;I'm sure.
Strange, I could never learn her history. Tom
Sheppard was always a close file, and would
never tell whom he married. Of this I'm certain,
however, she was much too good for him,
and was never meant to be a journeyman carpenter's
wife, still less what she is now. Her
heart's in the right place, at all events; and,
since that's the case, the rest may perhaps</pp>
<pb n="25">
<pp>come round,&mdash;that is, if she gets through her
present illness. A dry cough's the trumpeter
of death. If that's rule, she's not long for
this world. As to this little fellow, in spite of
the Dutchman, who, in my opinion, is more of
a Jacobite than a conjurer, and more of a knave
than either, he shall never mount a horse foaled
by an acorn, if I can help it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>The course of the carpenter's meditations
was here interrupted by a loud note of lamentation
from the child, who, disturbed by the
transfer, and not receiving the gentle solace to
which he was ordinarily accustomed, raised his
voice to the utmost, and exerted his feeble
strength to escape. For a few moments Mr.
Wood dandled his little charge to and fro,
after the most approved nursery fashion, essaying
at the same time the soothing influence of
an infantine melody proper to the occasion; 
but, failing in his design, he soon lost all patience,
and being, as we have before hinted,
rather irritable, though extremely well&hyphen;meaning,
he lifted the unhappy bantling in the air,
and shook him with so much good will, that he</pp>
<pb n="26">
<pp>had well&hyphen;nigh silenced him most effectually. A
brief calm succeeded. But with returning
breath came returning vociferations; and the
carpenter, with a faint hope of lessening the
clamour by change of scene, took up his lantern,
opened the door, and walked out</pp></p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Mrs. Sheppard's</smallcap> habitation terminated a row
of old ruinous buildings called Wheeler's
Rents; a dirty thoroughfare, part street, and
part lane, running from Mint Street, through
a variety of turnings, and along the brink of a
deep kennel, skirted by a number for petty and
neglected gardens in the direction of Saint
George's Fields. The neighbouring houses
were tenanted by the lowest order of insolvent
traders, thieves, mendicants, and other worthless
and nefarious characters, who fled thither
to escape from their creditors, or to avoid the
punishment due to their different offences; for
we may observe that the Old Mind, although it
had been divested for some of its privileges as a
sanctuary by a recent statute passed in the
reign of William the Third, still presented a</pp>
<pb n="28">
<pp>safe asylum to the debtor, and even continued
to do so until the middle of the reign of George
the First, when the crying nature of the evil
called loudly for a remedy, and another and
more sweeping enactment entirely took away
its immunities. In consequence of the encouragement
thus offered to dishonesty, and the
security afforded to crime, this quarter of the
Borough of Southwark was accounted (at the
period of our narrative) the grand receptacle
of the superfluous villany of the metropolis.
Infested by every description of vagabond and
miscreant, it was, perhaps, a few degrees worse
than the rookery near Saint Giles's and the
desperate neighbourhood of Saffron Hill in our
own time. And yet, on the very site of the sordid
tenements and squalid courts we have mentioned,
where the felon openly made his dwelling,
and the fraudulent debtor laughed the
object of his knavery to scorn&mdash;on this spot,
not two centuries ago, stood the princely residence
of Charles Brandon, the chivalrous Duke
of Suffolk, whose stout heart was a well of
honour, and whose memory breathes of loyalty</pp>
<pb n="29">
<pp>and valour. Suffolk House, as Brandon's
palace was denominated, was subsequently converted
into a mint by his royal brother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law,
Henry the Eighth; and, after its demolition,
and the removal of the place of coinage to the
Tower, the name was still continued to the
district in which it had been situated.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Old and dilapidated, the widow's domicile
looked the very picture of desolation and misery.
Nothing more forlorn could be conceived.
The roof was partially untiled; the
chimneys were tottering; the side&hyphen;walls bulged,
and were supported by a piece of timber
propped against the opposite house; the glass
in most of the windows was broken, and its
place supplied with paper; while, in some cases,
the very frames of the windows had been destroyed,
and the apertures were left free to the
airs of heaven. On the ground&hyphen;floor the shutters
were closed, or, to speak more correctly,
altogether nailed up, and presented a very singular
appearance, being patched all over with
the soles of old shoes, rusty hobnails, and bits
of iron hoops, the ingenious device of the former</pp>
<pb n="30">
<pp>occupant of the apartment, Paul Groves,
the cobbler, to whom we have before alluded.</pp></p>
<p>It was owing to the untimely end of this
poor fellow that Mrs. Sheppard was enabled to
take possession of the premises. In a fit of
despondency, superinduced by drunkenness, he
made away with himself; and when the body
was discovered, after a lapse of some months,
such was the impression produced by the spectacle
&mdash;such the alarm occasioned by the crazy
state of the building, and, above all, by the
terror inspired by strange and unearthly noises
heard during the night, which were, of course,
attributed to the spirit of the suicide, that the
place speedily enjoyed the reputation of being
haunted, and was, consequently, entirely abandoned.
In this state Mrs. Sheppard found it; 
and, as no one opposed her, she at once took
up her abode there; nor was she long in discovering
that the dreaded sounds proceeded
from the nocturnal gambols of a legion of rats.</p>
<p><pp>A narrow entry, formed by two low walls,
communicated with the main thoroughfare; 
and in this passage, under the cover of a penthouse,</pp>
<pb n="31">
<pp>stood Wood, with his little burthen, to
whom we shall now return.</pp></p>
<p>As Mrs. Sheppard did not make her appearance
quite so soon as he expected, the carpenter
became a litle fidgetty, and, having succeeded
in tranquillizing the child, he thought proper
to walk so far down the entry as would enable
him to reconnoitre the upper windows of the
house. A light was visible in the garret, feebly
struggling through the damp atmosphere, for
the night was raw and overcast. This light did
not remain stationary, but could be seen at
one moment glimmering through the rents in
the roof, and at another shining through the
cracks in the wall, or the broken panes of the
casement. Wood was unable to discover the
figure of the widow, but he recognised her dry,
hacking cough, and was about to call her down,
if she could not find the key, as he imagined
must be the case, when a loud noise was heard,
as though a chest, or some weighty substance,
had fallen upon the floor.</p>
<p><pp>Before Wood had time to inquire into the
cause of this sound, his attention was diverted</pp>
<pb n="32">
<pp>by a man, who rushed past the entry with the
swiftness of desperation. This individual apparently
met with some impediment to his further
progress; for he had not proceeded many
steps when he turned suddenly about, and
darted up the passage in which Wood stood.</pp></p>
<p>Uttering a few inarticulate ejaculations,&mdash; 
for he was completely out of breath,&mdash;the fugitive
placed a bundle in the arms of the carpenter,
and, regardless of the consternation he
excited in the breast of that personage, who
was almost stupified with astonishment, he
began to divest himself of a heavy horseman's
cloak, which he threw over Wood's shoulder,
and, drawing his sword, seemed to listen intently
for the approach of his pursuers.</p>
<p><pp>The appearance of the new&hyphen;comer was extremely
prepossessing; and, after his trepidation
had a little subsided, Wood began to
regard him with some degree of interest. Evidently
in the flower of his age, he was scarcely
less remarkable for symmetry of person than
for comeliness of feature; and, though his
attire was plain and unpretending, it was such</pp>
<pb n="33">
<pp>as could be worn only by one belonging to the
higher ranks of society. His figure was tall
and commanding, and the expression of his
countenance (though somewhat disturbed by
his recent exertion, was resolute and stern.</pp></p>
<p>At this juncture, a cry burst from the child,
who, nearly smothered by the weight imposed
upon him, only recovered the use of his lungs
as Wood altered the position of the bundle.
The stranger turned his head at the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; cried he in a tone of surprise,
&ldquo;you have an infant there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I have,&rdquo; replied Wood, angrily; 
for, finding that the intentions of the
stranger were pacific, so far as he was concerned,
he thought he might safely venture on
a slight display of spirit. &ldquo;It's very well
you haven't crushed the poor little thing to
death with this confounded clothes'&hyphen;bag. But
some people have no consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child may be the means of saving
me,&rdquo; muttered the stranger, as if struck by a
new idea: &ldquo;I shall gain time by the expedient.
Do you live here?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="34">
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; answered the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter. The door is open, so it is
needless to ask leave to enter. Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed
the stranger, as shouts and other vociferations
resounded at no great distance along the thoroughfare,
&ldquo;not a moment is to be lost. Give
me that precious charge,&rdquo; he added, snatching
the bundle from Wood. &ldquo;If I escape, I will
reward you. Your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owen Wood,&rdquo; replied the carpenter; &ldquo;I've
no reason to be ashamed of it. And now, a
fair exchange, sir. Yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger hesitated. The shouts drew
nearer, and lights were seen flashing ruddily
against the sides and gables of the neighbouring
houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Darrell,&rdquo; said the fugitive
hastily. &ldquo;But, if you are discovered, answer
no questions, as you value your life. Wrap
yourself in my cloak, and keep it. Remember!
not a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>So saying, he huddled the mantle over
Wood's shoulders, dashed the lantern to the
ground, and extinguished the light. A moment</pp>
<pb n="35">
<pp>afterwards, the door was closed and bolted,
and the carpenter found himself alone.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; cried he, as a thrill of
apprehension ran through his frame. &ldquo;The
Dutchman was right, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exclamation had scarcely escaped him,
when the discharge of a pistol was heard, and
a bullet whizzed past his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have him!&rdquo; cried a voice in triumph.</p>
<p>A man, then, rushed up the entry, and,
seizing the unlucky carpenter by the collar,
presented a drawn sword to his throat. This
person was speedily followed by half a dozen
others, some of whom carried flambeaux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mur&mdash;der!&rdquo; roared Wood, struggling to
free himself from his assailant, by whom he
was half strangled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the leaders
of the party in a furious tone, snatching
a torch from an attendant, and throwing
its light full upon the face of the carpenter; 
&ldquo;this is not the villain, Sir Cecil.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;So I find, Rowland,&rdquo; replied the other,
in accents of deep disappointment, and at the</pp>
<pb n="36">
<pp>same time relinquishing his grasp. &ldquo;I could
have sworn I saw him enter this passage.
And how comes his cloak on this knave's
shoulders?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It <it>is</it> his cloak, of a surety,&rdquo; returned
Rowland. &ldquo;Harkye, sirrah,&rdquo; continued he,
haughtily interrogating Wood; &ldquo;where is the
person from whom you received this mantle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throttling a man isn't the way to make
him answer questions,&rdquo; replied the carpenter,
doggedly. &ldquo;You'll get nothing out of me, I
can promise you, unless you show a little more
civility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waste time with this fellow,&rdquo; interposed
Sir Cecil, &ldquo;and may lose the object of
our quest, who, beyond doubt, has taken refuge
in this building. Let us search it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, the infant began to sob piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; cried Rowland, arresting his comrade.
&ldquo;Do you hear that? We are not
wholly at fault. The dog&hyphen;fox cannot be far
off, since the cub is found.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>With these words, he tore the mantle from
Wood's back, and, perceiving the child, endeavoured</pp>
<pb n="37">
<pp>to seize it. In this attempt he was,
however, foiled by the agility of the carpenter,
who managed to retreat to the door,
against which he placed his back, kicking the
boards vigorously with his heel.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan! Joan!&rdquo; vociferated he, &ldquo;open the
door, for God's sake, or I shall be murdered,
and so will your babby! Open the door
quickly, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock him on the head,&rdquo; thundered Sir
Cecil, &ldquo;or we shall have the watch upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that,&rdquo; rejoined Rowland:
&ldquo;such vermin never dare to show themselves
in this privileged district. All we have to
apprehend is a rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hint was not lost upon Wood. He
tried to raise an outcry, but his throat was
again forcibly griped by Rowland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another such attempt,&rdquo; said the latter,
&ldquo;and you are a dead man. Yield up the
babe, and I pledge my word you shall remain
unmolested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will yield it to no one but its mother,&rdquo; 
answered Wood.</p>
<pb n="38">
<p>&ldquo;'Sdeath! do you trifle with me, sirrah?&rdquo; 
cried Rowland fiercely. &ldquo;Give me the child,
or&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>As he spoke the door was thrown open,
and Mrs. Sheppard staggered forward. She
looked paler than ever; but her countenance,
though bewildered, did not exhibit the alarm
which might naturally have been anticipated
from the strange and perplexing scene presented
to her view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; cried Wood, holding the infant
towards her; &ldquo;take it, and fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard put out her arms mechanically.
But before the child could be committed
to her care, it was wrested from the
carpenter by Rowland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people are all in league with him,&rdquo; 
cried the latter. &ldquo;But don't wait for me, Sir
Cecil. Enter the house with your men. I'll
dispose of the brat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This injunction was instantly obeyed. The
knight and his followers crossed the threshold,
leaving one of the torch&hyphen;bearers behind
them.</p>
<pb n="39">
<p>&ldquo;Davies,&rdquo; said Rowland, delivering the
babe, with a meaning look, to his attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo; replied Davies, drawing
a little aside. And, setting down the link,
he proceeded deliberately to untie his cravat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! will you see your child strangled
before your eyes, and not so much as
scream for help?&rdquo; said Wood, staring at the
widow with a look of surprise and horror.
&ldquo;Woman, your wits are fled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it seemed; for all the answer she
could make was to murmur distractedly, &ldquo;I
can't find the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil take the key!&rdquo; ejaculated Wood.
&ldquo;They're about to murder your child&mdash;<it>your</it>
child, I tell you! Do you comprehend what I
say, Joan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've hurt my head,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard,
pressing her hand to her temples.</p>
<p>And then, for the first time, Wood noticed a
small stream of blood coursing slowly down
her cheek.</p>
<p>At this moment, Davies, who had completed
his preparations, extinguished the torch.</p>
<pb n="40">
<p>&ldquo;It's all over,&rdquo; groaned Wood, &ldquo;and perhaps
it's as well her senses are gone. However,
I'll make a last effort to save the poor
little creature,) if it costs me my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with this generous resolve, he shouted
at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Arrest! arrest! help!
help!&rdquo; seconding the words with a shrill and
peculiar cry, well known at the time to the
inhabitants of the quarter in which it was
uttered.</p>
<p>In reply to this summons a horn was instantly
blown at the corner of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo; vociferated Wood. &ldquo;Mint!
Mint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death and hell!&rdquo; cried Rowland, making
a furious pass at the carpenter, who fortunately
avoided the thrust in the darkness; 
&ldquo;will nothing silence you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; ejaculated Wood, renewing his
cries. &ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jigger closed!&rdquo; shouted a hoarse voice in
reply. &ldquo;All's bowman, my covey. Fear nothing.
We'll be upon the bandogs before
they can shake their trotters!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="41">
<p>And the alarum was sounded more loudly
than ever.</p>
<p>Another horn now resounded from the further
extremity of the thoroughfare; this was
answered by a third; and presently a fourth,
and more remote blast, took up the note of
alarm. The whole neighbourhood was disturbed.
A garrison called to arms at dead of
night on the sudden approach of the enemy,
could not have been more expeditiously, or
effectually aroused. Rattles were sprung; 
lanterns lighted, and hoisted at the end of
poles; windows thrown open; doors unbarred; 
and, as if by magic, the street was instantaneously
filled with a crowd of persons of
both sexes, armed with such weapons as came
most readily to hand, and dressed in such
garments as could be most easily slipped on.
Hurrying in the direction of the supposed
arrest, they encouraged each other with shouts,
and threatened the offending parties with their
vengeance.</p>
<p><pp>Regardless as the gentry of the Mint usually
were (for, indeed, they had become habituated</pp>
<pb n="42">
<pp>from their frequent occurrence to such scenes,)
of any outrages committed in their streets; 
deaf, as they had been, to the recent scuffle
before Mrs. Sheppard's door, they were always
sufficiently on the alert to maintain their privileges,
and to assist each other against the
attacks of their common enemy&mdash;the sheriff's
officer. It was only by the adoption of such
a course (especially since the late act of suppression,
to which we have alluded,) that the
inviolability of the asylum could be preserved.
Incursions were often made upon its territories
by the functionaries of the law; sometimes
attended with success, but more frequently
with discomfiture; and it rarely happened,
unless by stratagem or bribery, that
(in the language of the gentlemen of the short
staff) an important caption could be effected.
In order to guard against accidents or surprises,
watchmen, or scouts, (as they were
styled,) were stationed at the three main outlets
of the sanctuary ready to give the signal
in the manner just described: bars were erected,
which, in case of emergency, could be</pp>
<pb n="43">
<pp>immediately stretched across the streets; doors
were attached to the alleys; and were never
opened without due precautions; gates were
affixed to the courts, wickets to the gates, and
bolts to the wickets. The back windows of
the houses (where any such existed) were
strongly barricaded, and kept constantly shut; 
and the fortress was, furthermore, defended by
high walls and deep ditches in those quarters
where it appeared most exposed. There was
also a Maze, (the name is still retained in the
district,) into which the debtor could run,
and through the intricacies of which it was
impossible for an officer to follow him, without
a clue. Whoever chose to incur the risk
of so doing might enter the Mint at any hour; 
but no one was suffered to depart without
giving a satisfactory account of himself, or
producing a pass from the Master. In short,
every contrivance that ingenuity could devise
was resorted to by this horde of reprobates to
secure themselves from danger or molestation.
Whitefriars had lost its privileges; Salisbury
Court and the Savoy no longer offered places</pp>
<pb n="44">
<pp>of refuge to the debtor; and it was, therefore,
doubly requisite that the Island of Bermuda
(as the Mint was termed by its occupants)
should uphold its rights, as long as it was
able to do so.</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood, meantime, had not remained
idle. Aware that not a moment was to be
lost, if he meant to render any effectual assistance
to the child, he ceased shouting, and
defending himself in the best way he could
from the attacks of Rowland, by whom he was
closely pressed, forced his way, in spite of all
opposition, to Davies, and dealt him a blow
on the head with such good will that, had it
not been for the intervention of the wall, the
ruffian must have been prostrated. Before he
could recover from the stunning effects of the
blow, Wood possessed himself of the child:
and, untying the noose which had been slipped
round its throat, had the satisfaction of
hearing it cry lustily.</p>
<p>At this juncture, Sir Cecil and his followers
appeared at the threshold.</p>
<pb n="45">
<p>&ldquo;He has escaped!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight; 
&ldquo;we have searched every corner of the house
without finding a trace of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; cried Rowland. &ldquo;Don't you hear
those shouts? Yon fellow's clamour has
brought the whole horde of jail&hyphen;birds and
cut&hyphen;throats that infest this place about our
ears. We shall be torn in pieces if we are
discovered. Davies!&rdquo; he added, calling to the
attendant, who was menacing Wood with a
severe retaliation, &ldquo;don't heed him; but, if
you value a whole skin, come into the house,
and bring that woman with you. She may
afford us some necessary information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davies reluctantly complied. And, dragging
Mrs. Sheppard, who made no resistance,
along with him, entered the house, the door
of which was instantly shut and barricaded.</p>
<p>A moment afterwards, the street was illumined
by a blaze of torchlight, and a tumultuous
uproar, mixed with the clashing of weapons,
and the braying of horns, announced the
arrival of the first detachment of Minters.</p>
<pb n="46">
<p>Mr. Wood rushed instantly to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted he, waving his hat
triumphantly over his head. &ldquo;Saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, it's all bob, my covey! You're
safe enough, that's certain!&rdquo; responded the
Minters, baying, yelping, leaping, and howling
around him like a pack of hounds when the
huntsman is beating cover; &ldquo;but, where are
the lurchers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traps!&rdquo; responded a bystander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shoulder&hyphen;clappers!&rdquo; added a lady,
who, in her anxiety to join the party, had
unintentionally substituted her husband's nether
habiliments for her own petticoats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ban&hyphen;dogs!&rdquo; thundered a tall man,
whose stature and former avocations had procured
him the nickname of &ldquo;The long drover
of the Borough market.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, where are they?&rdquo; chorussed the mob,
flourishing their various weapons, and flashing
their torches in the air; &ldquo;we'll sarve 'em
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Mr. Wood trembled. He felt he had raised</pp>
<pb n="47">
<pp>a storm which it would be very difficult, if
not impossible, to allay. He knew not what
to say, or what to do; and his confusion was
increased by the threatening gestures and furious
looks of the ruffians in his immediate
vicinity.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't understand you, gentlemen,&rdquo; stammered
he, at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; roared the long
drover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he don't understand flash,&rdquo; replied
the lady in gentleman's attire.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Cease your confounded clutter!&rdquo; said a
young man, whose swarthy visage, seen in the
torchlight, struck Wood as being that of a
Mulatto. &ldquo;You frighten the cull out of his
senses. It's plain he don't understand our
lingo; as, how should he? Take pattern by
me;&rdquo; and as he said this he strode up to
the carpenter, and, slapping him on the shoulder,
propounded the following questions, accompanying
each interrogation with a formidable
contortion of countenance. &ldquo;Curse you!
Where are the bailiffs? Rot you! have you</pp>
<pb n="48">
<pp>lost your tongue? Devil seize you! you
could bawl loud enough a moment ago!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, Blueskin!&rdquo; interposed an authoritative
voice, immediately behind the ruffian.
&ldquo;Let me have a word with the cull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! ay!&rdquo; cried several of the bystanders,
&ldquo;let Jonathan kimbaw the cove. He's got
the gift of the gab.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>The crowd accordingly drew aside, and the
individual, in whose behalf the movement had
been made, immediately stepped forward. He
was a young man of about two&hyphen;and&hyphen;twenty,
who, without having anything remarkable
either in dress or appearance, was yet a noticeable
person, if only for the indescribable
expression of cunning pervading his countenance.
His eyes were small and grey; as
far apart and as sly&hyphen;looking as those of a
fox. A physiognomist, indeed, would have
likened him to that crafty animal, and it must
be owned the general formation of his features
favoured such a comparison. The nose was
long and sharp, the chin pointed, the forehead
broad and flat, and connected, without any</pp>
<pb n="49">
<pp>intervening hollow, with the eyelid; the teeth
when displayed, seemed to reach from ear to
ear. Then his beard was of a reddish hue,
and his complexion warm and sanguine. Those
who had seen him slumbering, averred that
he slept with his eyes open. But this might
be merely a figurative mode of describing his
customary vigilance. Certain it was, that the
slightest sound aroused him. This astute personage
was somewhat under the middle size,
but fairly proportioned, inclining rather to
strength than symmetry, and abounding more
in muscle than in flesh.</pp></p>
<p>It would seem, from the attention which he
evidently bestowed upon the hidden and complex
machinery of the grand system of villainy
at work around him, that his chief object in
taking up his quarters in the Mint, must have
been to obtain some private information respecting
the habits and practices of its inhabitants,
to be turned to account hereafter.</p>
<p><pp>Advancing towards Wood, Jonathan fixed
his keen grey eyes upon him, and demanded,
in a stern tone, whether the persons who had</pp>
<pb n="50">
<pp>taken refuge in the adjoining house, were
bailiffs.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; replied the carpenter,
who had in some degree recovered his
confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I presume you've not been arrested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; answered Wood firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed as much. Perhaps you'll next
inform us why you have occasioned this disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because this child's life was threatened
by the persons you have mentioned,&rdquo; rejoined
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent reason, i' faith!&rdquo; exclaimed
Blueskin, with a roar of surprise and indignation,
which was echoed by the whole assemblage.
&ldquo;And so we're to be summoned from
our beds and snug firesides, because a kid
happens to squall, eh? By the soul of my
grandmother, but this is too good!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Do you intend to claim the privileges
of the Mint?&rdquo; said Jonathan, calmly pursuing</pp>
<pb n="51">
<pp>his interrogations amid the uproar. &ldquo;Is your
person in danger?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from my creditors,&rdquo; replied Wood,
significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he post the cole? Will he come
down with the dues? Ask him that?&rdquo; cried
Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; pursued Jonathan; &ldquo;my friend
desires to know if you are willing to pay your
footing as a member of the ancient and respectable
fraternity of debtors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe no man a farthing, and my name
shall never appear in any such rascally list,&rdquo; 
replied Wood angrily. &ldquo;I don't see why I
should be obliged to pay for doing my duty.
I tell you this child would have been strangled.
The noose was at its throat when I called
for help. I knew it was in vain to cry &lsquo;murder!&rsquo; 
in the Mint, so I had recourse to stratagem.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, sir, I must say you deserve some
credit for your ingenuity, at all events,&rdquo; replied
Jonathan, repressing a smile; &ldquo;but, before you</pp>
<pb n="52">
<pp>put out your foot so far, it would have been
quite as prudent to consider how you were to
draw it back again. For my own part, I don't
see in what way it is to be accomplished, except
by the payment of our customary fees. Do
not imagine you can at one moment avail yourself
of our excellent regulations, (with which
you seem sufficiently well acquainted,) and the
next break them with impunity. If you assume
the character of a debtor for your own
convenience, you must be content to maintain
it for ours. If you have not been arrested,
we have been disturbed; and it is but just and
reasonable you should pay for occasioning such
disturbance. By your own showing you are
in easy circumstances,&mdash;for it is only natural
to presume that a man who owes nothing must
be in a condition to pay liberally,&mdash;and you
cannot therefore feel the loss of such a trifle
as ten guineas.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>However illogical and inconclusive these arguments
might appear to Mr. Wood, and however
he might dissent from the latter proposition,
he did not deem it expedient to make</pp>
<pb n="53">
<pp>any reply; and the orator proceeded with his
harangue amid the general applause of the
assemblage.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am perhaps exceeding my authority in
demanding so slight a sum,&rdquo; continued Jonathan,
modestly, &ldquo;and the Master of the Mint
may not be disposed to let you off so lightly.
He will be here in a moment or so, and you
will then learn his determination. In the mean
time, let me advise you as a friend not to
irritate him by a refusal, which would be
as useless as vexatious. He has a very summary
mode of dealing with refractory persons,
I assure you. My best endeavours shall
be used to bring you off, on the easy terms I
have mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call ten guineas easy terms?&rdquo; cried
Wood, with a look of dismay. &ldquo;Why, I
should expect to purchase the entire freehold
of the Mint for less money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a man has been glad to pay double
the amount to get his head from under the
mint pump,&rdquo; observed Blueskin, gruffly.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Let the gentleman take his own course,&rdquo;</pp>
<pb n="54">
<pp>said Jonathan, mildly. &ldquo;I should be sorry
to persuade him to do anything his calmer
judgment might disapprove.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly my sentiments,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin.
&ldquo;I wouldn't force him for the world; 
but if he don't tip the stivers, may I be cursed
if he don't get a taste of the <it>aqua pompaginis</it>.
Let's have a look at the kinchen that <it>ought</it>
to have been throttled,&rdquo; added he, snatching
the child from Wood. &ldquo;My stars! here's a
pretty lullaby&hyphen;cheat to make a fuss about&mdash; 
ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal with me as you think proper, gentlemen,&rdquo; 
exclaimed Wood; &ldquo;but, for mercy's
sake don't harm the child! Let it be taken
to its mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is its mother?&rdquo; asked Jonathan,
in an eager whisper. &ldquo;Tell me frankly, and
speak under your breath. Your own safety&mdash; 
the child's safety&mdash;depends upon your candour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>While Mr. Wood underwent this examination,
Blueskin felt a small and trembling hand</pp>
<pb n="55">
<pp>placed upon his own, and, turning at the summons,
beheld a young female, whose features
were partially concealed by a loo, or half mask,
standing beside him. Coarse as were the ruffian's
notions of feminine beauty, he could not
be insensible to the surpassing loveliness of
the fair creature, who had thus solicited his
attention. Her figure was, in some measure,
hidden by a large scarf, and a deep hood
drawn over the head contributed to her disguise; 
still it was evident, from her lofty bearing,
that she had nothing in common, except
an interest in their proceedings, with the crew
by whom she was surrounded.</pp></p>
<p>Whence she came,&mdash;who she was,&mdash;and
what she wanted,&mdash;were questions which naturally
suggested themselves to Blueskin, and
he was about to seek for some explanation,
when his curiosity was checked by a gesture
of silence from the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said she, in a low, but agitated
voice; &ldquo;would you earn this purse?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I've no objection,&rdquo; replied Blueskin, in</pp>
<pb n="56">
<pp>a tone intended to be gentle, but which sounded
like the murmuring whine of a playful
bear. &ldquo;How much is there in it?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It contains gold,&rdquo; replied the lady; &ldquo;but
I will add this ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do to earn it?&rdquo; asked Blueskin,
with a disgusting leer,&mdash;&ldquo;cut a throat&mdash; 
or throw myself at your feet&mdash;eh, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that child,&rdquo; returned the lady,
with difficulty overcoming the loathing inspired
by the ruffian's familiarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see!&rdquo; replied Blueskin, winking
significantly. &ldquo;Come nearer, or they'll observe
us. Don't be afraid&mdash;I won't hurt you.
I'm always agreeable to the women, bless
their kind hearts! Now! slip the purse into
my hand. Bravo!&mdash;the best cly&hyphen;faker of 'em
all couldn't have done it better. And now for
the fawney&mdash;the ring I mean. I'm no great
judge of these articles, ma'am; but I trust
to your honour not to palm off paste upon
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a diamond,&rdquo; said the lady, in an
agony of distress,&mdash;&ldquo;the child!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="57">
<p>&ldquo;A diamond! Here, take the kid,&rdquo; cried
Blueskin, slipping the infant adroitly under
her scarf. &ldquo;And so this is a diamond,&rdquo; added
he, contemplating the brilliant from the hollow
of his hand: &ldquo;it does sparkle almost as brightly
as your ogles. By the by, my dear, I forgot
to ask your name&mdash;perhaps you'll oblige
me with it now? Hell and the devil!&mdash; 
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around in vain. The lady had
disappeared.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Jonathan</smallcap>, meanwhile, having ascertained the
parentage of the child from Wood, proceeded
to question him, in an under tone, as to the
probable motives of the attempt upon its life; 
and, though he failed in obtaining any information
on this point, he had little difficulty
in eliciting such particulars of the mysterious
transaction as have already been recounted.
When the carpenter concluded his recital,
Jonathan was for a moment lost in reflection.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Devilish strange!&rdquo; thought he, chuckling
to himself; &ldquo;queer business! Capital trick
of the cull in the cloak to make another person's
brat stand the brunt for his own&mdash;capital!
ha! ha! Won't do, though. He must
be a sly fox to get out of the Mint without my</pp>
<pb n="59">
<pp>knowledge. I've a shrewd guess where he's
taken refuge; but I'll ferret him out. These
bloods will pay well for his capture; if not,
<it>he'll</it> pay well to get out of their hands; so
I'm safe either way&mdash;ha! ha! Blueskin,&rdquo; 
he added aloud, and motioning that worthy,
&ldquo;follow me.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Upon which, he set off in the direction of
the entry. His progress, however, was checked
by loud acclamations, announcing the arrival
of the Master of the Mint and his train.</p>
<p><pp>Baptist Kettleby (for so was the Master
named) was a &ldquo;goodly portly man, and a corpulent,&rdquo; 
whose fair round paunch bespoke the
affection he entertained for good liquor and
good living. He had a quick, shrewd, merry
eye, and a look in which duplicity was agreeably
veiled by good humour. It was easy to
discover that he was a knave, but equally easy
to perceive that he was a pleasant fellow; a
combination of qualities by no means of rare
occurrence. So far as regards his attire, Baptist
was not seen to advantage. No great lover
of state or state costume at any time, he was</pp>
<pb n="60">
<pp>generally, towards the close of an evening,
completely in dishabille, and in this condition
he now presented himself to his subjects. His
shirt was unfastened, his vest unbuttoned, his
hose ungartered; his feet were stuck into a
pair of pantoufles, his arms into a greasy flannel
dressing&hyphen;gown, his head into a thrum&hyphen;cap,
the cap into a tie&hyphen;periwig, and the wig into
a gold&hyphen;edged hat. A white apron was tied
round his waist, and into the apron was thrust
a short thick truncheon, which looked very
much like a rolling&hyphen;pin.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The Master of the Mint was accompanied
by another gentleman almost as portly as himself,
and quite as deliberate in his movements.
The costume of this personage was somewhat
singular, and might have passed for a masquerading
habit, had not the imperturbable gravity
of his demeanour forbidden any such supposition.
It consisted of a close jerkin of
brown frieze, ornamented with a triple row
of brass buttons; loose Dutch slops, made
very wide in the seat and very tight at the
knees; red stockings with black clocks, and</pp>
<pb n="61">
<pp>a fur cap. The owner of this dress had a
broad weather&hyphen;beaten face, small twinkling
eyes, and a bushy, grizzled beard. Though
he walked by the side of the governor, he
seldom exchanged a word with him, but appeared
wholly absorbed in the contemplations
inspired by a broad&hyphen;bowled Dutch pipe.</pp></p>
<p>Behind the illustrious personages just described
marched a troop of stalwart fellows,
with white badges in their hats, quarter&hyphen;staves,
oaken cudgels, and links in their hands. These
were the Master's body&hyphen;guard.</p>
<p>Advancing towards the Master, and claiming
an audience, which was instantly granted, Jonathan,
without much circumlocution, related the
sum of the strange story he had just learnt
from Wood, omitting nothing except a few
trifling particulars, which he thought it politic
to keep back; and, with this view, he
said not a word of their being any probability
of capturing the fugitive, but, on the
contrary, roundly asserted that his informant
had witnessed that person's escape.</p>
<p><pp>The Master listened, with becoming attention,</pp>
<pb n="62">
<pp>to the narrative, and, at its conclusion,
shook his head gravely, applied his thumb
to the side of his nose, and, twirling his fingers
significantly, winked at his phlegmatic companion.
The gentleman appealed to shook
his head in reply, coughed as only a Dutchman
<it>can</it> cough, and raising his hand from
the bowl of his pipe, went through precisely
the same mysterious ceremonial as the Master.</pp></p>
<p>Putting his own construction upon this mute
interchange of opinions, Jonathan ventured to
observe, that it certainly was a very perplexing
case, but that he thought something <it>might</it>
be made of it, and, if left to him, he would
undertake to manage the matter to the Master's
entire satisfaction.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Ja, ja, Muntmeester,&rdquo; said the Dutchman,
removing the pipe from his mouth, and speaking
in a deep and guttural voice, &ldquo;leave the
affair to Johannes. He'll settle it brafely.
And let ush go back to our brandewyn, and
hollandsche genever. Dese ere not schouts,
as you faind, but jonkers on a vrolyk; and
if dey'd chanshed to keel de vrow Sheppard's</pp>
<pb n="63">
<pp>pet lamb, dey'd have done her a servish, by
shaving it from dat unpleasant complaint, de
hempen fever, with which its laatter days are
threatened, and of which its poor vader died.
Myn Got! haanging runs in some families,
Muntmeester. It's hereditary, like de jigt,
vat you call it&mdash;gout&mdash;haw! haw!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;If the child <it>is</it> destined to the gibbet, Van
Galgebrok,&rdquo; replied the Master, joining in the
laugh, &ldquo;it'll never be choked by a footman's
cravat, that's certain; but, in regard to going
back empty&hyphen;handed,&rdquo; continued he, altering
his tone, and assuming a dignified air, &ldquo;it's
quite out of the question. With Baptist Kettleby,
to engage in a matter is to go through
with it. Besides, this is an affair which no
one but myself can settle. Common offences
may be decided upon by deputy; but outrages
perpetrated by men of rank, as these
appear to be, must be judged by the Master
of the Mint in person. These are the decrees
of the Island of Bermuda, and I will never
suffer its excellent laws to be violated. Gentlemen
of the Mint,&rdquo; added he, pointing with</pp>
<pb n="64">
<pp>his truncheon towards Mrs. Sheppard's house,
&ldquo;forward!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the mob, and the whole
phalanx was put in motion in that direction.
At the same moment a martial flourish, proceeding
from cows' horns, tin canisters filled
with stones, bladders and cat&hyphen;gut, with other
sprightly instruments, was struck up, and, enlivened
by this harmonious accompaniment,
the troop reached its destination in the best
possible spirits for an encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us in,&rdquo; said the Master, rapping his
truncheon authoritatively against the boards,
&ldquo;or we'll force an entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as no answer was returned to the summons,
though it was again, and more peremptorily,
repeated, Baptist seized a mallet from a
bystander and burst open the door. Followed
by Van Galgebrok and others of his retinue,
he then rushed into the room, where Rowland,
Sir Cecil, and their attendants, stood with
drawn swords prepared to receive them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat down their blades,&rdquo; cried the Master; 
&ldquo;no bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="65">
<p>&ldquo;Beat out their brains, you mean,&rdquo; rejoined
Blueskin with a tremendous imprecation; 
&ldquo;no half measures now, Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn't you better hold a moment's parley
with the gentlemen before proceeding to extremities?&rdquo; 
suggested Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; responded the Master. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; 
he added, staring at Rowland, &ldquo;either I'm
greatly mistaken, or it is&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;You are not mistaken, Baptist,&rdquo; returned
Rowland with a gesture of silence; 
&ldquo;it is your old friend. I'm glad to recognise
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I'm glad your worship's recognition
doesn't come too late,&rdquo; observed the Master.
&ldquo;But why didn't you make yourself known at
once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd forgotten the office you hold in the
Mint, Baptist,&rdquo; replied Rowland. &ldquo;But clear
the room of this rabble, if you have sufficient
authority over them. I would speak with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's but one way of clearing it, your
worship,&rdquo; said the Master, archly.</p>
<pb n="66">
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied Rowland. &ldquo;Give
them what you please. I'll repay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's all right, pals,&rdquo; cried Baptist, in a
loud tone; &ldquo;the gentlemen and I have settled
matters. No more scuffling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the meaning of all this?&rdquo; demanded
Sir Cecil. &ldquo;How have you contrived
to still these troubled waters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've chanced upon an old ally in the Master
of the Mint,&rdquo; answered Rowland. &ldquo;We
may trust him,&rdquo; he added in a whisper; &ldquo;he is
a staunch friend of the good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blueskin, clear the room,&rdquo; cried the Master; 
&ldquo;these gentlemen would be private.
They've <it>paid</it> for their lodging. Where's
Jonathan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inquiries were instantly made after that individual,
but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; observed the Master; &ldquo;I thought
he'd been at my elbow all this time. But it
don't much matter&mdash;though he's a devilish
shrewd fellow, and might have helped me out
of a difficulty, had any occurred. Hark ye,
Blueskin,&rdquo; continued he, addressing that personage,</pp>
<pb n="67">
<pp>who, in obedience to his commands,
had, with great promptitude, driven out the
rabble, and again secured the door, &ldquo;a word
in your ear. What female entered the house
with us?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood and thunder!&rdquo; exclaimed Blueskin,
afraid, if he admitted having seen the lady, of
being compelled to divide the plunder he had
obtained from her among his companions,
&ldquo;how should I know? D'ye suppose I'm
always thinking of the petticoats? I observed
no female; but if any one <it>did</it> join the assault,
it must have been either Amazonian Kate, or
Fighting Moll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman I mean did not join the assault,&rdquo; 
rejoined the Master, &ldquo;but rather
seemed to shun observation; and, from the
hasty glimpse I caught of her, she appeared to
have a child in her arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, most probably, it was the widow
Sheppard,&rdquo; answered Blueskin, sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said the Master, &ldquo;I didn't
think of her. And now I've another job for
vou.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="68">
<p>&ldquo;Propose it,&rdquo; returned Blueskin, inclining
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Square accounts with the rascal who got
up the sham arrest; and, if he don't tip the
cole without more ado, give him a taste of the
pump, that's all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall go through the whole course,&rdquo; 
replied Blueskin, with a ferocious grin, &ldquo;unless
he comes down to the last grig. We'll
lather him with mud, shave him with a rusty
razor, and drench him with <it>aqua pompaginis</it>.
Master, your humble servant.&mdash;Gentlemen,
your most obsequious trout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having effected his object, which was to get
rid of Blueskin, Baptist turned to Rowland
and Sir Cecil, who had watched his proceedings
with much impatience, and remarked, &ldquo;Now,
gentlemen, the coast's clear; we've nothing to

<p><pp><smallcap>Leaving</smallcap> them to pursue their conference, we
shall follow the footsteps of Jonathan, who, as
the Master surmised, and, as we have intimated,
had unquestionably entered the house.
But at the beginning of the affray, when he
thought every one was too much occupied with
his own concerns to remark his absence, he
slipped out of the room, not for the purpose of
avoiding the engagement (for cowardice was
not one of his failings), but because he had
another object in view. Creeping stealthily up
stairs, unmasking a dark lantern, and glancing
into each room as he passed, he was startled
in one of them by the appearance of Mrs.
Sheppard, who seemed to be crouching upon
the floor. Satisfied, however, that she did not
notice him, Jonathan glided away as noiselessly</pp>
<pb n="70">
<pp>as he came, and ascended another short flight
of stairs leading to the garret. As he crossed
this chamber, his foot struck against something
on the floor, which nearly threw him down,
and stooping to examine the object, he found
it was a key. &ldquo;Never throw away a chance,&rdquo; 
thought Jonathan. &ldquo;Who knows but this
key may open a golden lock one of these
days?&rdquo; And, picking it up, he thrust it into
his pocket.</pp></p>
<p>Arrived beneath an aperture in the broken
roof, he was preparing to pass through it,
when he observed a little heap of tiles upon
the floor, which appeared to have been recently
dislodged. &ldquo;He <it>has</it> passed this way,&rdquo; cried
Jonathan, exultingly; &ldquo;I have him safe
enough.&rdquo; He then closed the lantern, mounted
without much difficulty upon the roof, and
proceeded cautiously along the tiles.</p>
<p><pp>The night was now profoundly dark. Jonathan
had to feel his way. A single false step
might have precipitated him into the street; or,
if he had trodden upon an unsound part of the
roof, he must have fallen through it. He had</pp>
<pb n="71">
<pp>nothing to guide him; for though the torches
were blazing ruddily below, their gleam fell
only on the side of the building. The venturous
climber gazed for a moment at the
assemblage beneath, to ascertain that he was
not discovered; and, having satisfied himself in
this particular, he stepped out more boldly.
On gaining a stack of chimneys at the back
of the house, he came to a pause, and again
unmasked his lantern. Nothing, however,
could be discerned, except the crumbling brickwork.
&ldquo;Confusion!&rdquo; ejaculated Jonathan; 
&ldquo;can he have escaped? No. The walls are
too high, and the windows too stoutly barricaded
in this quarter, to admit such a supposition.
He can't be far off. I shall find him
yet. Ah! I have it,&rdquo; he added, after a moment's
deliberation; &ldquo;he's there, I'll be
sworn.&rdquo; And, once more enveloping himself
in darkness, he pursued his course.</pp></p>
<p><pp>He had now reached the adjoining house,
and, scaling the roof, approached another building,
which seemed to be, at least, one story
loftier than its neighbours. Apparently, Jonathan</pp>
<pb n="72">
<pp>was well acquainted with the premises; 
for, feeling about in the dark, he speedily discovered
a ladder, up the steps of which he
hurried. Drawing a pistol, and unclosing his
lantern with the quickness of thought, he then
burst through an open trap&hyphen;door into a small
loft.</pp></p>
<p>The light fell upon the fugitive, who stood
before him in an attitude of defence, with the
child in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan, acting upon
the information he had obtained from Wood; 
&ldquo;I have found you at last. Your servant,
Mr. Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the fugitive,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, uncocking the
pistol, and placing it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know you are a friend?&rdquo; asked
Darrell.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;What should I do here alone if I were an
enemy? But, come, don't let us waste time in
bandying words, when we might employ it so
much more profitably. Your life, and that of</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>280Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010103">
<pb n="73">
<pp>your child, are in my power. What will you
give me to save you from your pursuers?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>Can</it> you do so?&rdquo; asked the other, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, and will. Now, the reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have but an ill&hyphen;furnished purse. But if
I escape, my gratitude&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; interrupted Jonathan, scornfully.
&ldquo;Your gratitude will vanish with your danger.
Pay fools with promises. I must have something
in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have all I have about me,&rdquo; replied
Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well,&rdquo; grumbled Jonathan, &ldquo;I suppose
I must be content. An ill&hyphen;lined purse is a
poor recompense for the risk I have run.
However, come along. I needn't tell you to
tread carefully. You know the danger of this
breakneck road as well as I do. The light
would betray us.&rdquo; So saying, he closed the
lantern.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Harkye, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Darrell; &ldquo;one word
before I move. I know not who you are; and,
as I cannot discern your face, I may be doing</pp>
<pb n="74">
<pp>you an injustice. But there is something in
your voice that makes me distrust you. If you
attempt to play the traitor, you will do so at
the hazard of your life.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already hazarded my life in this attempt
to save you,&rdquo; returned Jonathan boldly,
and with apparent frankness; &ldquo;this ought to
be sufficient answer to your doubts. Your
pursuers are below. What was to hinder me,
if I had been so inclined, from directing them
to your retreat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; replied Darrell. &ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Followed by Darrell, Jonathan retraced his
dangerous path. As he approached the gable
of Mrs. Sheppard's house, loud yells and vociferations
reached his ears; and, looking downwards,
he perceived a great stir amid the mob.
The cause of this uproar was soon manifest.
Blueskin and the Minters were dragging Wood
to the pump. The unfortunate carpenter struggled
violently, but ineffectually. His hat was
placed upon one pole, his wig on another. His
shouts for help were answered by roars of
mockery and laughter. He continued alternately</pp>
<pb n="75">
<pp>to be tossed in the air, or rolled in the
kennel until he was borne out of sight. The
spectacle seemed to afford as much amusement
to Jonathan as to the actors engaged in it. He
could not contain his satisfaction, but chuckled,
and rubbed his hands with delight.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; cried Darrell, &ldquo;it is the poor
fellow whom I placed in such jeopardy a short
time ago. I am the cause of his ill&hyphen;usage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure you are,&rdquo; replied Jonathan,
laughing. &ldquo;But, what of that? It'll be a
lesson to him in future, and will show him the
folly of doing a good&hyphen;natured action!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>But perceiving that his companion did not
relish his pleasantry, and fearing that his sympathy
for the carpenter's situation might betray
him into some act of imprudence, Jonathan,
without further remark, and by way of putting
an end to the discussion, let himself drop
through the roof. His example was followed
by Darrell. But, though the latter was somewhat
embarrassed by his burthen, he peremptorily
declined Jonathan's offer of assistance.
Both, however, having safely landed, they</pp>
<pb n="76">
<pp>cautiously crossed the room, and passed down
the first flight of steps in silence. At this moment,
a door was opened below; lights gleamed
on the walls; and the figures of Rowland and
Sir Cecil were distinguished at the foot of the
stairs.</pp></p>
<p>Darrell stopped, and drew his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have betrayed me,&rdquo; said he, in a deep
whisper, to his companion; &ldquo;but you shall reap
the reward of your treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; returned Jonathan, in the same
under tone, and with great self&hyphen;possession: &ldquo;I
can yet save you. And see!&rdquo; he added, as the
figures drew back, and the lights disappeared; 
&ldquo;it's a false alarm. They have retired. However,
not a moment is to be lost. Give me your
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>He then hurried Darrell down another short
flight of steps, and entered a small chamber at
the back of the house. Closing the door, Jonathan
next produced his lantern, and, hastening
towards the window, undrew a bolt by which it
was fastened. A stout wooden shutter, opening
inwardly, being removed, disclosed a grating of</pp>
<pb n="77">
<pp>iron bars. This obstacle, which appeared to
preclude the possibility of egress in that quarter,
was speedily got rid of. Withdrawing
another bolt, and unhooking a chain suspended
from the top of the casement, Jonathan pushed
the iron framework outwards. The bars dropped
noiselessly and slowly down, till the chain
tightened at the staple.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are free,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that grating
forms a ladder, by which you may descend in
safety. I learnt the trick of the place from one
Paul Groves, who used to live here, and who
contrived the machine. He used to call it his
fire&hyphen;escape&mdash;ha! ha! I've often used the ladder
for my own convenience, but I never expected
to turn it to such good account. And
now, sir, have I kept faith with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; replied Darrell. &ldquo;Here is my
purse; and I trust you will let me know to
whom I am indebted for this important service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters not who I am,&rdquo; replied Jonathan,
taking the money. &ldquo;As I said before, I
have little reliance upon <it>professions</it> of
gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I know not how it is,&rdquo; sighed Darrell, &ldquo;but</pp>
<pb n="78">
<pp>I feel an unaccountable misgiving at quitting
this place. Something tells me I am rushing
on greater danger.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You know best,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, sneeringly; 
&ldquo;but if I were in your place I would
take the chance of a future and uncertain risk
to avoid a present and certain peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; replied Darrell; &ldquo;the
weakness is past. Which is the nearest way to
the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it's an awkward road to direct you,&rdquo; 
returned Jonathan. &ldquo;But if you turn to the
right when you reach the ground, and keep
close to the Mint wall, you'll speedily arrive
at White Cross Street; White Cross Street, if
you turn again to the right, will bring you into
Queen Street; Queen Street, bearing to the
left, will conduct you to Deadman's Place; 
and Deadman's Place to the water&hyphen;side, not
fifty yards from Saint Saviour's stairs, where
you're sure to get a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very point I aim at,&rdquo; said Darrell as
he passed through the outlet.</p>
<pb n="79">
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said Jonathan, aiding his descent; 
&ldquo;you had better take my lantern. It may be
useful to you. Perhaps you'll give me in return
some token, by which I may remind you
of this occurrence, in case we meet again. Your
glove will suffice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; replied the other, tossing him
the glove. &ldquo;Are you sure these bars touch
the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come within a yard of it,&rdquo; answered
Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; shouted Darrell, as he effected a
secure landing. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; muttered Jonathan, &ldquo;having started
the hare, I'll now unleash the hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this praiseworthy determination, he
was hastening down stairs, with the utmost rapidity,
when he encountered a female, whom he
took, in the darkness, to be Mrs. Sheppard.
The person caught hold of his arm, and, in
spite of his efforts to disengage himself, detained
him.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked she, in an agitated</pp>
<pb n="80">
<pp>whisper. &ldquo;I heard his voice; but I saw them
on the stairs, and durst not approach him, for
fear of giving the alarm.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean the fugitive, Darrell, he has
escaped through the back window,&rdquo; replied
Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you women are forgiving creatures,
I must say,&rdquo; observed Jonathan, sarcastically.
&ldquo;You thank Heaven for the escape of the
man who did his best to get your child's neck
twisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the female, in
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say,&rdquo; replied Jonathan.
&ldquo;Perhaps you don't know that this Darrell so
contrived matters, that your child should be
mistaken for his own; by which means it had
a narrow escape from a tight cravat, I can assure
you. However, the scheme answered well
enough, for Darrell has got off with his own
brat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this is not my child?&rdquo; exclaimed
she, with increased astonishment.</p>
<pb n="81">
<p>&ldquo;If you have a child there, it certainly is
not,&rdquo; answered Jonathan, a little surprised; 
&ldquo;for I left your brat in the charge of Blueskin,
who is still among the crowd in the street,
unless, as is not unlikely, he's gone to see your
other friend disciplined at the pump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Providence!&rdquo; exclaimed the female.
&ldquo;Whose child can this be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the devil should I know?&rdquo; replied
Jonathan gruffly. &ldquo;I suppose it didn't drop
through the ceiling, did it? Are you quite
sure it's flesh and blood?&rdquo; asked he, playfully
pinching its arm till it cried out with
pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child! my child!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Sheppard, rushing from the adjoining room.
&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the mother of this child?&rdquo; inquired
the person who had first spoken, addressing
Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;I am!&rdquo; cried the widow, snatching
the babe, and pressing it to her breast with
rapturous delight. &ldquo;God be thanked, I have
found it!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="82">
<p>&ldquo;We have both good reason to be grateful,&rdquo; 
added the lady, with great emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Sblood!&rdquo; cried Jonathan, who had listened
to the foregoing conversation with angry wonder,
&ldquo;I've been nicely done here. Fool that
I was to part with my lantern! But I'll soon
set myself straight. What ho! lights! lights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, shouting as he went, he flung himself
down stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I fly?&rdquo; exclaimed the lady,
bewildered with terror. &ldquo;They will kill me, if
they find me, as they would have killed my
husband and child. Oh God! my limbs fail
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make an effort, madam,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard,
as a storm of furious voices resounded
from below, and torches were seen mounting
the stairs; &ldquo;they are coming!&mdash;they are coming!
&mdash;fly!&mdash;to the roof! to the roof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried the lady, &ldquo;this room&mdash;I recollect
&mdash;it has a back window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is shut,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is open,&rdquo; replied the lady, rushing towards
it, and springing through the outlet.</p>
<pb n="83">
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; thundered Jonathan, who
at this moment reached Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has flown up stairs,&rdquo; replied the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie, hussy!&rdquo; replied Jonathan, rudely
pushing her aside, as she vainly endeavoured to
oppose his entrance into the room; &ldquo;she is
here. Hist!&rdquo; cried he, as a scream was heard
from without. &ldquo;By G&wblank;! she has missed her
footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a momentary and terrible silence,
broken only by a few feeble groans.</p>
<p>Sir Cecil, who with Rowland and some
others had entered the room rushed to the
window with a torch.</p>
<p>He held down the light, and a moment afterwards
beckoned, with a blanched cheek, to
Rowland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister is dead,&rdquo; said he, in a deep
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her blood be upon her own head, then,&rdquo; 
replied Rowland, sternly. &ldquo;Why came she
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;She could not resist the hand of fate</pp>
<pb n="84">
<pp>which drew her hither,&rdquo; replied Sir Cecil,
mournfully.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Descend and take charge of the body,&rdquo; said
Rowland, conquering his emotion by a great
effort. &ldquo;I will join you in a moment. This accident
rather confirms than checks my purpose.
The stain upon our family is only half effaced:
I have sworn the death of the villain and his
bastard, and I will keep my oath. Now,
sir,&rdquo; he added, turning to Jonathan, as Sir
Cecil and his followers obeyed his injunctions,
&ldquo;you say you know the road which
the person whom we seek has taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Jonathan. &ldquo;But I give
no information gratis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, then,&rdquo; said Rowland, placing money
in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll find him at St. Saviour's stairs,&rdquo; 
answered Jonathan. &ldquo;He's about to cross
the river. You'd better lose no time. He
has got five minutes' start of you. But I
sent him the longest way about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely pronounced, when
Rowland disappeared.</p>
<pb n="85">
<p>&ldquo;And now to see the end of it,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
shortly afterwards passing through the
window. &ldquo;Good night, Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three persons only were left in the room.
These were the Master of the Mint, Van Galgebrok,
and Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad business this, Van,&rdquo; observed Baptist,
with a prolonged shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja, ja, Muntmeester,&rdquo; said the Hollander,
shaking his head in reply;&mdash;&ldquo;very bad&mdash; 
very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then they're staunch supporters of
our friend over the water,&rdquo; continued Baptist,
winking significantly; &ldquo;so we must e'en hush
it up in the best way we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja,&rdquo; answered Van Galgebrok. &ldquo;But&mdash; 
sapperment!&mdash;I wish they hadn't broken my
pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<smallcap>Jonathan Wild</smallcap> promises well,&rdquo; observed
the Master, after a pause: &ldquo;he'll become a
great man. Mind, I, Baptist Kettleby, say
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;He'll be haanged nevertheless,&rdquo; replied the
Hollander, giving his collar an ugly jerk.</pp>
<pb n="86">
<pp>Mind, I, Rykhart Van Galgebrok predict it.
And now let's go back to the Shovels, and
finish our brandewyn and bier, Muntmeester.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard, relieved by
their departure, and giving way to a passionate
flood of tears; &ldquo;were it not for my child,
I should wish to be in the place of that unfortunate
lady.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>For</smallcap> a short space, Mrs. Sheppard remained
dissolved in tears. She then dried her eyes, and
laying her child gently upon the floor, knelt
down beside him. &ldquo;Open my heart, Father
of Mercy!&rdquo; she murmured, in a humble tone,
and with downcast looks, &ldquo;and make me sensible
of the error of my ways. I have sinned
deeply; but I have been sorely tried. Spare
me yet a little while, Father! not for my own
sake, but for the sake of this poor babe.&rdquo; Her
utterance was here choked by sobs. &ldquo;But if
it is thy will to take me from him,&rdquo; she continued,
as soon as her emotion permitted her,
&mdash;&ldquo;if he must be left an orphan amid strangers,
implant, I beseech thee, a mother's feelings
in some other bosom, and raise up a</pp>
<pb n="88">
<pp>friend, who shall be to him what I would
have been. Let him not bear the weight of
my punishment. Spare him!&mdash;pity me!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>With this she arose, and, taking up the
infant, was about to proceed down stairs,
when she was alarmed by hearing the street&hyphen;door
opened, and the sound of heavy foot&hyphen;steps
entering the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa, widow!&rdquo; shouted a rough voice
from below, &ldquo;where the devil are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard returned no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've got something to say to you,&rdquo; continued
the speaker, rather less harshly; &ldquo;something
to your advantage; so come out o' your
hiding&hyphen;place, and let's have some supper, for
I'm infernally hungry.&mdash;D'ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the widow remained silent.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, if you won't come, I shall help myself,
and that's unsociable,&rdquo; pursued the
speaker, evidently, from the noise he made,
suiting the action to the word. &ldquo;Devilish
nice ham you've got here!&mdash;capital pie!&mdash; 
and, as I live, a flask of excellent canary.
You're in luck to&hyphen;night, widow. Here's your</pp>
<pb n="89">
<pp>health in a bumper, and wishing you a better
husband than your first. It'll be your own
fault if you don't soon get another and a
proper young man into the bargain. Here's
his health likewise. What! mum still. You're
the first widow I ever heard of who could withstand
that lure. I'll try the effect of a jolly
stave.&rdquo; And he struck up the following ballad:&mdash;</pp></p>

singer, as he brought his ditty to a close; 
&ldquo;will nothing tempt her out? Widow Sheppard,
I say,&rdquo; he added, rising, &ldquo;don't be</pp>
<pb n="93">
<pp>afraid. It's only a gentleman come to offer
you his hand. &lsquo;He that woos a maid,&rsquo;&mdash;folde&hyphen;rol
&mdash;(hiccupping.)&mdash;I'll soon find you
out.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard, whose distress at the consumption
of the provisions had been somewhat
allayed by the anticipation of the intruder's
departure after he had satisfied his
appetite, was now terrified in the extreme by
seeing a light approach, and hearing footsteps
on the stairs. Her first impulse was
to fly to the window; and she was about
to pass through it, at the risk of sharing
the fate of the unfortunate lady, when her
arm was grasped by some one in the act of
ascending the ladder from without. Uttering
a faint scream, she sank backwards, and would
have fallen, if it had not been for the interposition
of Blueskin, who, at that moment,
staggered into the room with a candle in one
hand, and the bottle in the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you're here, are you?&rdquo; said the
ruffian, with an exulting laugh: &ldquo;I've been
looking for you everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="94">
<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; implored Mrs. Sheppard,&mdash; 
&ldquo;pray let me go. You hurt the child. Don't
you hear how you've made it cry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throttle the kid!&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin,
fiercely. &ldquo;If you don't stop its squalling,
I will. I hate children. And, if I'd my
own way, I'd drown 'em all like a litter o'
puppies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well knowing the savage temper of the
person she had to deal with, and how likely
he was to put his threat into execution, Mrs.
Sheppard did not dare to return any answer; 
but, disengaging herself from his embrace,
endeavoured meekly to comply with his request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, widow,&rdquo; continued the ruffian,
setting down the candle, and applying his
lips to the bottle neck as he flung his heavy
frame upon a bench, &ldquo;I've a piece o' good
news for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news will be news to me. What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin, attempting to</pp>
<pb n="95">
<pp>throw a gallant expression into his forbidding
countenance.</pp></p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard trembled violently; and
though she understood his meaning too well,
she answered,&mdash;&ldquo;I can't guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; returned the ruffian, &ldquo;to
put you out o' suspense, as the topsman remarked
to poor Tom Sheppard, afore he
turned him off, I'm come to make you an
honourable proposal o' marriage. You won't
refuse me, I'm sure; so no more need be
said about the matter. To&hyphen;morrow, we'll go
to the Fleet and get spliced. Don't shake
so. What I said about your brat was all
stuff. I didn't mean it. It's my way when
I'm ruffled. I shall take to him as nat'ral
as if he were my own flesh and blood afore
long.&mdash;I'll give him the edication of a prig,&mdash; 
teach him the use of his forks betimes,&mdash;and
make him, in the end, as clever a cracksman
as his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Sheppard; &ldquo;never!
never!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="96">
<p>&ldquo;Halloa! what's this?&rdquo; demanded Blueskin,
springing to his feet. &ldquo;Do you mean
to say that if I support your kid, I shan't
bring him up how I please&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't question me, but leave me,&rdquo; replied
the widow wildly; &ldquo;you had better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave you!&rdquo; echoed the ruffian, with a
contemptuous laugh; &ldquo;&mdash;not just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not unprotected,&rdquo; rejoined the poor
woman; &ldquo;there's some one at the window.
Help! help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her cries were unheeded. And Blueskin,
who, for a moment, had looked round
distrustfully, concluding it was a feint, now
laughed louder than ever.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It won't do, widow,&rdquo; said he, drawing
near her, while she shrank from his approach,
&ldquo;so you may spare your breath. Come, come,
be reasonable, and listen to me. Your kid
has already brought me good luck, and may
bring me still more if his edication's attended
to. This purse,&rdquo; he added, chinking it in
the air, &ldquo;and this ring, were given me for
him just now by the lady, who made a false</pp>
<pb n="97">
<pp>step on leaving your house. If I'd been in
the way, instead of Jonathan Wild, that accident
wouldn't have happened.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>As he said this, a slight noise was heard
without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; ejaculated the ruffian,
glancing uneasily towards the window. &ldquo;Who's
there?&mdash;Pshaw! it's only the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's Jonathan Wild,&rdquo; returned the widow,
endeavouring to alarm him. &ldquo;I told you I
was not unprotected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>He</it> protect <it>you</it>,&rdquo; retorted Blueskin,
maliciously; 
<lb>&ldquo;you haven't a worse enemy on
the face of the earth than Jonathan Wild.
If you'd read your husband's dying speech,
you'd know that he laid his death at Jonathan's
door,&mdash;and with reason too, as I can
testify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Sheppard, with a
vehemence that shook even the hardened wretch
beside her, &ldquo;begone, and tempt me not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;What should I tempt you to?&rdquo; asked
Blueskin, in surprise.</pp>
<pb n="98">
<pp>&ldquo;To&mdash;to&mdash;no matter what,&rdquo; returned the
widow distractedly. &ldquo;Go&mdash;go!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin,
tossing a large case&hyphen;knife, which he took from
his pocket, in the air, and catching it dexterously
by the haft as it fell; &ldquo;you owe Jonathan
a grudge;&mdash;so do I. He hanged your
first husband. Just speak the word,&rdquo; he
added, drawing the knife significantly across
his throat, &ldquo;and I'll put it out of his power
to do the same by your second. But d&mdash;n
him! let's talk o' something more agreeable.
Look at this ring;&mdash;it's a diamond, and worth
a mint o' money. It shall be your wedding
ring. Look at it, I say. The lady's name's
engraved inside, but so small I can scarcely
read it. <smallcap>A&hyphen;l&hyphen;i&hyphen;v&hyphen;a</smallcap>&mdash;Aliva&mdash;<smallcap>T&hyphen;r&hyphen;e&hyphen;n</smallcap>&mdash;Trencher
&mdash;that's it. Aliva Trencher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aliva Trenchard!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sheppard,
hastily; &ldquo;is that the name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, now I look again it <it>is</it> Trenchard.
How came you to know it? Have you heard
the name before?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I think I have&mdash;long, long ago, when I</pp>
<pb n="99">
<pp>was a child,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard, passing
her hand across her brow; &ldquo;but my memory is
gone&mdash;quite gone. Where <it>can</it> I have heard
it!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil knows,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin. &ldquo;Let
it pass. The ring's yours, and you're mine.
Here, put it on your finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard snatched back her hand from
his grasp, and exerted all her force to repel his
advances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set down the kid,&rdquo; roared Blueskin, savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Sheppard, struggling
to escape, and holding the infant at arm's
length; &ldquo;have mercy on this helpless innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the child, alarmed by the strife, added
its feeble cries to its mother's shrieks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set it down, I tell you,&rdquo; thundered Blueskin,
&ldquo;or I shall do it a mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>Uttering a terrible imprecation, Blueskin
placed the knife between his teeth, and endeavoured
to seize the poor woman by the throat.</p>
<pb n="100">
<p>In the struggle her cap fell off. The ruffian
caught hold of her hair, and held her fast.
The chamber rang with her shrieks. But her
cries, instead of moving her assailant's compassion,
only added to his fury. Planting his
knee against her side, he pulled her towards
him with one hand, while with the other he
sought his knife. The child was now within
reach; and, in another moment, he would have
executed his deadly purpose, if an arm from
behind had not felled him to the ground.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Sheppard, who had been stricken
down by the blow that prostrated her assailant,
looked up, she perceived Jonathan
Wild kneeling beside the body of Blueskin.
He was holding the ring to the light, and
narrowly examining the inscription.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trenchard,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;Aliva Trenchard
&mdash;they were right, then, as to the name.
Well, if she survives the accident&mdash;as the
blood, who styles himself Sir Cecil, fancies she
may do&mdash;this ring will make my fortune by
leading to the discovery of the chief parties
concerned in this strange affair.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="101">
<p>&ldquo;Is the poor lady alive?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Sheppard,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Sblood!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan, hastily
thrusting the ring into his vest, and taking
up a heavy horseman's pistol with which he
had felled Blueskin,&mdash;&ldquo;I thought you'd been
senseless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she alive?&rdquo; repeated the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that to you?&rdquo; demanded Jonathan,
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Sheppard. &ldquo;But pray tell me if her husband
has escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her husband!&rdquo; echoed Jonathan scornfully.
&ldquo;A <it>husband</it> has little to fear from his
wife's kinsfolk. Her <it>lover</it>, Darrell, has embarked
upon the Thames, where, if he's not
capsized by the squall, (for it's blowing like
the devil,) he stands a good chance of getting
his throat cut by his pursuers&mdash;ha! ha! I
tracked 'em to the banks of the river, and
should have followed to see it out, if the watermen
hadn't refused to take me. However, as
things have turned up, it's fortunate that I
came back.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="102">
<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard; 
&ldquo;most fortunate for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For <it>you</it>!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan &ldquo;don't
flatter yourself that I'm thinking of you.
Blueskin might have butchered you and your
brat before I'd have lifted a finger to prevent
him, if it hadn't suited my purposes to do so,
and <it>he</it> hadn't incurred my displeasure. I
never forgive an injury. Your husband could
have told you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How had he offended you?&rdquo; inquired the
widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; answered Jonathan, sternly.
&ldquo;He thwarted my schemes twice. The first
time, I overlooked the offence; but the second
time, when I had planned to break open the
house of his master, the fellow who visited
you to&hyphen;night,&mdash;Wood, the carpenter of Wych
Street,&mdash;he betrayed me. I told him I would
bring him to the gallows, and I was as good
as my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were so,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard; 
&ldquo;and for that wicked deed you will one day
be brought to the gallows yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="103">
<p>&ldquo;Not before I have conducted your child
thither,&rdquo; retorted Jonathan, with a withering
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Sheppard, paralysed
by the threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that sickly brat lives to be a man,&rdquo; 
continued Jonathan, rising, &ldquo;I'll hang him
upon the same tree as his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity!&rdquo; shrieked the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll be his evil genius!&rdquo; vociferated Jonathan,
who seemed to enjoy her torture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone, wretch!&rdquo; cried the mother, stung
beyond endurance by his taunts; &ldquo;or I will
drive you hence with my curses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse on, and welcome,&rdquo; jeered Wild.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard raised her hand, and the malediction
trembled upon her tongue. But ere
the words could find utterance, her maternal
tenderness overcame her indignation; and,
sinking upon her knees, she extended her
arms over her child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mother's prayers&mdash;a mother's blessings,&rdquo; 
she cried, with the fervour almost of inspiration,
&ldquo;will avail against a fiend's malice.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="104">
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan, turning
carelessly upon his heel.</p>
<p>And, as he quitted the room, the poor widow
fell with her face upon the floor.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>As</smallcap> soon as he was liberated by his persecutors,
Mr. Wood set off at full speed from the
Mint, and, hurrying he scarce knew whither,
(for there was such a continual buzzing in his
ears and dancing in his eyes, as almost to take
away the power of reflection,) he held on at a
brisk pace till his strength completely failed
him.</p>
<p><pp>On regaining his breath, he began to consider
whither chance had led him; and, rubbing his
eyes to clear his sight, he perceived a sombre
pile, with a lofty tower and broad roof, immediately
in front of him. This structure at once
satisfied him as to where he stood. He knew
it to be St. Saviour's Church. As he looked
up at the massive tower, the clock tolled forth</pp>
<pb n="106">
<pp>the hour of midnight. The solemn strokes
were immediately answered by a multitude of
chimes, sounding across the Thames, amongst
which the deep note of Saint Paul's was plainly
distinguishable. A feeling of inexplicable awe
crept over the carpenter as the sounds died
away. He trembled, not from any superstitious
dread, but from an undefined sense of
approaching danger. The peculiar appearance
of the sky was not without some influence in
awakening these terrors. Over one of the pinnacles
of the tower a speck of pallid light marked
the position of the moon, then newly born
and newly risen. It was still profoundly dark; 
but the wind, which had begun to blow with
some violence, chased the clouds rapidly across
the heavens, and dispersed the vapours hanging
nearer the earth. Sometimes the moon was totally
eclipsed; at others, it shed a wan and
ghastly glimmer over the masses rolling in the
firmament. Not a star could be discerned,
but, in their stead, streaks of lurid radiance,
whence proceeding it was impossible to determine,
shot ever and anon athwart the dusky</pp>
<pb n="107">
<pp>vault, and added to the ominous and threatening
appearance of the night.</pp></p>
<p>Alarmed by these prognostications of a
storm, and feeling too much exhausted from
his late severe treatment to proceed further on
foot, Wood endeavoured to find a tavern where
he might warm and otherwise refresh himself.
With this view he struck off into a narrow
street on the left, and soon entered a small alehouse,
over the door of which hung the sign of
the &ldquo;Welsh Trumpeter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a glass of brandy,&rdquo; said he,
addressing the host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late, master,&rdquo; replied the landlord of
the Trumpeter, in a surly tone, for he did not
much like the appearance of his customer;</p>
<p>&ldquo;just shut up shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds! David Pugh, don't you know
your old friend and countryman?&rdquo; exclaimed
the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Owen Wood, is it you?&rdquo; cried David
in astonishment. &ldquo;What the devil makes you
out so late? And what has happened to you,
man, eh?&mdash;you seem in a queer plight.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="108">
<p>&ldquo;Give me the brandy, and I'll tell you,&rdquo; replied
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, wife&mdash;hostess&mdash;fetch me that bottle
from the second shelf in the corner cupboard.
&mdash;There, Mr. Wood,&rdquo; cried David, pouring
out a glass of the spirit, and offering it to the
carpenter, &ldquo;that'll warm the cockles of your
heart. Don't be afraid, man,&mdash;off with it. It's
right Nantz. I keep it for my own drinking,&rdquo; 
he added in a lower tone.</p>
<p><pp>Mr. Wood having disposed of the brandy,
and pronounced himself much better, hurried
close to the fire&hyphen;side, and informed his friend
in a few words of the inhospitable treatment he
had experienced from the gentlemen of the
Mint; whereupon Mr. Pugh, who, as well as
the carpenter, was a descendant of Cadwallader,
waxed extremely wrath; gave utterance
to a number of fierce&mdash;sounding imprecations in
the Welsh tongue; and was just beginning to
express the greatest anxiety to catch some of
the rascals at the Trumpeter, when Mr. Wood
cut him short by stating his intention of crossing</pp>
<pb n="109">
<pp>the river as soon as possible in order to
avoid the storm.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;A storm!&rdquo; exclaimed the landlord. &ldquo;Gadzooks!
I thought something was coming on; 
for when I looked at the weather&hyphen;glass an
hour ago, it had sunk lower than I ever remember
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have a durty night on it, to a
sartinty, landlord,&rdquo; observed an old one&mdash;eyed
sailor, who sat smoking his pipe by the fireside.
&ldquo;The glass never sinks in that way,
d'ye see, without a hurricane follerin'. I've
knowed it often do so in the West Injees.
Moreover, a couple o' porpusses came up with
the tide this mornin', and ha' bin flounderin'
about i' the Thames abuv Lunnun Bridge all
day long; and them say&mdash;monsters, you know,
always proves sure fore&mdash;runners of a gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the sooner I'm off the better,&rdquo; cried
Wood; &ldquo;what's to pay, David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't affront me, Owen, by asking such a
question,&rdquo; returned the landlord; &ldquo;hadn't you
better stop and finish the bottle?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="110">
<p>&ldquo;Not a drop more,&rdquo; replied Wood.
&ldquo;Enough's as good as a feast. Good
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won't be persuaded, and must
have a boat, Owen,&rdquo; observed the landlord,
&ldquo;there's a waterman asleep on that bench will
help you to as tidy a craft as any on the
Thames. Halloa, Ben!&rdquo; cried he, shaking a
broad&mdash;backed fellow, equipped in a short&mdash;skirted
doublet, and having a badge upon his arm,&mdash; 
&ldquo;scullers wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa! my hearty!&rdquo; cried Ben, starting
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman wants a pair of oars,&rdquo; said
the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, master?&rdquo; asked Ben, touching
his woollen cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arundel Stairs,&rdquo; replied Wood, &ldquo;the
nearest point to Wych Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, master,&rdquo; said the waterman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark'ee, Ben,&rdquo; said the old sailor, knocking
the ashes from his pipe upon the hob; 
&ldquo;you may try, but dash my timbers if you'll
ever cross the Thames to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="111">
<p>&ldquo;And why not, old saltwater?&rdquo; inquired
Ben, turning a quid in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Cos there's a gale a&mdash;getting up as'll perwent
you, young freshwater,&rdquo; replied the tar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must look sharp then, or I shall give it
the slip,&rdquo; laughed Ben: &ldquo;the gale never yet
blowed as could perwent my crossing the
Thames. The weather's been foul enough for
the last fortnight, but I've never turned my
back upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be not,&rdquo; replied the old sailor, drily; 
&ldquo;but you'll find it too stiff for you to&hyphen;night,
anyhow. Howsomdever, if you <it>should</it> reach
t'other side, take an old feller's advice, and
don't be foolhardy enough to venter back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell 'ee what, saltwater,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;I'll
lay you my fare&mdash;and that'll be two shillin'&mdash; 
I'm back in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried the old sailor. &ldquo;But vere'll
be the use o' vinnin'? you von't live to pay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; replied Ben, gravely; &ldquo;dead
or alive I'll pay you, if I lose. There's my
thumb upon it. Come along, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I tell'ee what, landlord,&rdquo; observed the old</pp>
<pb n="112">
<pp>sailor, quietly replenishing his pipe from a huge
pewter tobacco&hyphen;box, as the waterman and Wood
quitted the house, &ldquo;you've said good&hyphen;b'ye to
your friend.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd's me! do you think so?&rdquo; cried the
host of the Trumpeter. &ldquo;I'll run and bring
him back. He's a Welshman, and I wouldn't
for a trifle that any accident befel him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the old sailor, taking up
a piece of blazing coal with the tongs, and applying
it to his pipe; &ldquo;let 'em try. They'll
be back soon enough&mdash;or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Mr. Wood and the waterman, meanwhile,
proceeded in the direction of St. Saviour's
Stairs. Casting a hasty glance at the old and
ruinous prison belonging to the liberty of the
Bishop of Winchester, (whose palace formerly
adjoined the river,) called the Clink, which
gave its name to the street, along which he
walked; and noticing, with some uneasiness,
the melancholy manner in which the wind whistled
through its barred casements, the carpenter
followed his companion down an opening to the
right, and presently arrived at the water&hyphen;side.</pp>
<pb n="113">
<pp>Moored to the steps, several wherries were
dancing in the rushing current, as if impatient
of restraint. Into one of these the waterman
jumped, and, having assisted Mr. Wood to a
seat within it, immediately pushed from land.
Ben had scarcely adjusted his oars, when the
gleam of a lantern was seen moving towards
the bank. A shout was heard at a little distance,
and, the next moment, a person rushed
with breathless haste to the stair&hyphen;head.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat there!&rdquo; cried a voice, which Mr.
Wood fancied he recognised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll find a waterman asleep under his
tilt in one of them ere craft, if you look about,
sir,&rdquo; replied Ben, backing water as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't you take me with you?&rdquo; urged the
voice; &ldquo;I'll make it well worth your while.
I've a child here whom I wish to convey across
the water without loss of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child!&rdquo; thought Wood; &ldquo;it must be
the fugitive Darrell. &ldquo;Hold hard,&rdquo; cried he,
addressing the waterman; &ldquo;I'll give the gentleman
a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Unpossible, master,&rdquo; rejoined Ben; &ldquo;the</pp>
<pb n="114">
<pp>tide's running down like a mill&mdash;sluice, and the
wind's right in our teeth. Old saltwater was
right. We shall have a reg'lar squall afore we
gets across. D'ye hear how the wanes creaks on
old Winchester House? We shall have a touch
on it ourselves presently. But I shall lose my
wager if I stay a moment longer&mdash;so here
goes.&rdquo; Upon which, he plunged his oars deeply
into the stream, and the bark shot from the
strand.</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood's anxiety respecting the fugitive
was speedily relieved by hearing another waterman
busy himself in preparation for starting; 
and, shortly after, the dip of a second pair of
oars sounded upon the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse me, if I don't think all the world
means to cross the Thames this fine night,&rdquo; observed
Ben. &ldquo;One'd think it rained fares, as
well as blowed great guns. Why, there's another
party on the stair&hyphen;head inquiring arter
scullers; and, by the mass! they appear in a
greater hurry than any on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>His attention being thus drawn to the bank,
the carpenter beheld three figures, one of whom</pp>
<pb n="115">
<pp>bore a torch, leap into a wherry of a larger size
than the others, which immediately put off from
shore. Manned by a couple of watermen, who
rowed with great swiftness, this wherry dashed
through the current in the track of the fugitive,
of whom it was evidently in pursuit, and upon
whom it perceptibly gained. Mr. Wood strained
his eyes to catch a glimpse of the flying skiff.
But he could only discern a black and shapeless
mass, floating upon the water at a little distance,
which, to his bewildered fancy, appeared
absolutely standing still. To the practised eye
of the waterman matters wore a very different
air. He perceived clearly enough, that the
chase was moving quickly; and he was also
aware, from the increased rapidity with which
the oars were urged, that every exertion was
made on board to get out of the reach of her
pursuers. At one moment, it seemed as if the
flying bark was about to put to shore. But
this plan (probably from its danger) was instantly
abandoned; not, however, before her
momentary hesitation had been taken advantage
of by her pursuers, who, redoubling their</pp>
<pb n="116">
<pp>efforts at this juncture, materially lessened the
distance between them.</pp></p>
<p>Ben watched these man&oelig;uvres with great
interest, and strained every sinew in his frame
to keep ahead of the other boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them's catchpoles, I s'pose, sir, arter the
gemman with a writ?&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something worse, I fear,&rdquo; Wood replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you don't think as how they're
crimps, do you?&rdquo; Ben inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know what I think,&rdquo; Wood answered
sulkily; and he bent his eyes upon
the water, as if he wished to avert his attention
forcibly from the scene.</p>
<p><pp>There is something that inspires a feeling
of inexpressible melancholy in sailing on a
dark night upon the Thames. The sounds
that reach the ear, and the objects that meet
the eye, are all calculated to awaken a train
of sad and serious contemplation. The ripple
of the water against the boat, as its keel
cleaves through the stream&mdash;the darkling current
hurrying by&mdash;the indistinctly&mdash;seen craft,
of all forms and all sizes, hovering around,</pp>
<pb n="117">
<pp>and making their way in ghost&hyphen;like silence,
or warning each other of their approach by
cries, that, heard from afar, have something
doleful in their note&mdash;the solemn shadows
cast by the bridges&mdash;the deeper gloom of
the echoing arches&mdash;the lights glimmering
from the banks&mdash;the red reflection thrown
upon the waves by a fire kindled on some
stationary barge&mdash;the tall and fantastic shapes
of the houses, as discerned through the obscurity; 
&mdash;these, and other sights and sounds
of the same character, give a sombre colour
to the thoughts of one who may choose to
indulge in meditation at such a time and in
such a place.</pp></p>
<p><pp>But it was otherwise with the carpenter.
This was no night for the indulgence of dreamy
musing. It was a night of storm and terror,
which promised each moment to become more
stormy and more terrible. Not a bark could
be discerned on the river, except those already
mentioned. The darkness was almost
palpable; and the wind which, hitherto, had
been blowing in gusts, was suddenly lulled.</pp>
<pb n="118">
<pp>It was a dead calm. But this calm was more
awful than the previous roaring of the blast.</pp></p>
<p>Amid this portentous hush, the report of
a pistol reached the carpenter's ears; and,
raising his head at the sound, he beheld a
sight which filled him with fresh apprehensions.</p>
<p>By the light of a torch borne at the stern
of the hostile wherry, he saw that the pursuers
had approached within a short distance
of the object of their quest. The shot had
taken effect upon the waterman who rowed
the chase. He had abandoned his oars, and
the boat was drifting with the stream towards
the enemy. Escape was now impossible. Darrell
stood erect in the bark, with his drawn
sword in hand, prepared to repel the attack
of his assailants, who, in their turn, seemed
to await with impatience the moment which
should deliver him into their power.</p>
<p><pp>They had not to tarry long. In another
instant, the collision took place. The watermen,
who manned the larger wherry, immediately
shipped their oars, grappled with the</pp>
<pb n="119">
<pp>drifting skiff, and held it fast. Wood, then,
beheld two persons, one of whom he recognised
as Rowland, spring on board the chase. A
fierce struggle ensued. There was a shrill
cry, instantly succeeded by a deep splash.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Put about, waterman, for God's sake!&rdquo; 
cried Wood, whose humanity got the better
of every personal consideration; &ldquo;some one
is overboard. Give way, and let us render
what assistance we can to the poor wretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's all over with him by this time, master,&rdquo; 
replied Ben, turning the head of his
boat, and rowing swiftly towards the scene
of strife; &ldquo;but d&mdash;n him, he was the chap
as hit poor Bill Thomson just now, and I
don't much care if he should be food for
fishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>As Ben spoke, they drew near the opposing
parties. The contest was now carried on between
Rowland and Darrell. The latter had
delivered himself from one of his assailants,
the attendant, Davies. Hurled over the sides
of the skiff, the ruffian speedily found a watery
grave. It was a spring&hyphen;tide at half ebb; and</pp>
<pb n="120">
<pp>the current, which was running fast and furiously,
bore him instantly away. While the
strife raged between the principals, the watermen
in the larger wherry were occupied in
stemming the force of the torrent, and endeavouring
to keep the boats, they had lashed
together, stationary. Owing to this circumstance,
Mr. Wood's boat, impelled alike by
oar and tide, shot past the mark at which it
aimed; and before it could be again brought
about, the struggle had terminated. For a
few minutes, Darrell seemed to have the advantage
in the conflict. Neither combatant
could use his sword; and in strength the
fugitive was evidently superior to his antagonist.
The boat rocked violently with the
struggle. Had it not been lashed to the adjoining
wherry, it must have been upset, and
have precipitated the opponents into the water.
Rowland felt himself sinking beneath the powerful
grasp of his enemy. He called to the
other attendant, who held the torch. Understanding
the appeal, the man snatched his master's
sword from his grasp, and passed it</pp>
<pb n="121">
<pp>through Darrell's body. The next moment,
a heavy plunge told that the fugitive had been
consigned to the waves.</pp></p>
<p>Darrell, however, rose again instantly; and
though mortally wounded, made a desperate
effort to regain the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; he groaned faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well reminded,&rdquo; answered Rowland, who
had witnessed his struggles with a smile of
gratified vengeance; &ldquo;I had forgotten the accursed
imp in this confusion. Take it,&rdquo; he
cried, lifting the babe from the bottom of
the boat, and flinging it towards its unfortunate
father.</p>
<p>The child fell within a short distance of
Darrell, who, hearing the splash, struck out
in that direction, and caught it before it sank.
At this juncture, the sound of oars reached
his ears, and he perceived Mr. Wood's boat
bearing up towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is, waterman,&rdquo; exclaimed the benevolent
carpenter. &ldquo;I see him!&mdash;row for your
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That's the way to miss him, master,&rdquo; replied</pp>
<pb n="122">
<pp>Ben coolly. &ldquo;We must keep still. The
tide'll bring him to us fast enough.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Ben judged correctly. Borne along by the
current, Darrell was instantly at the boat's
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seize this oar,&rdquo; vociferated the waterman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First take the child,&rdquo; cried Darrell, holding
up the infant, and clinging to the oar with
a dying effort.</p>
<p>Give it me,&rdquo; returned the carpenter; &ldquo;all's
safe. Now lend me your own hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My strength fails me,&rdquo; gasped the fugitive.
&ldquo;I cannot climb the boat. Take my
child to&mdash;it is&mdash;oh God!&mdash;I am sinking&mdash;take
it&mdash;take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; shouted Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell attempted to reply. But he could
only utter an inarticulate exclamation. The
next moment his grasp relaxed, and he sank
to rise no more.</p>
<p>Rowland, meantime, alarmed by the voices,
snatched a torch from his attendant, and holding
it over the side of the wherry, witnessed
the incident just described.</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>292Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010105">
<pb n="123">
<p>&ldquo;Confusion!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;there is another
boat in our wake. They have rescued the
child. Loose the wherry, and stand to your
oars&mdash;quick&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These commands were promptly obeyed.
The boat was set free, and the men resumed
their seats. Rowland's purposes were, however,
defeated in a manner as unexpected as
appalling.</p>
<p><pp>During the foregoing occurrences a dead
calm prevailed. But as Rowland sprang to
the helm, and gave the signal for pursuit, a
roar like a volley of ordnance was heard aloft,
and the wind again burst its bondage. A moment
before, the surface of the stream was
black as ink. It was now whitening, hissing,
and seething like an enormous cauldron. The
blast once more swept over the agitated river:
whirled off the sheets of foam, scattered them
far and wide in rain&hyphen;drops, and left the raging
torrent blacker than before. The gale had
become a hurricane: that hurricane was the
most terrible that ever laid waste our city.
Destruction everywhere marked its course.</pp>
<pb n="124">
<pp>Steeples toppled, and towers reeled beneath
its fury. Trees were torn up by the roots; 
many houses were levelled to the ground; 
others were unroofed; the leads on the
churches were ripped off, and &ldquo;shrivelled up
like scrolls of parchment.&rdquo; Nothing on land
or water was spared by the remorseless gale.
Most of the vessels lying in the river were
driven from their moorings, dashed tumultuously
against each other, or blown ashore.
All was darkness, horror, confusion, ruin.
Men fled from their tottering habitations,
and returned to them scared by greater dangers.
The end of the world seemed at hand.</pp></p>
<p><pp>At this time of universal havoc and despair,
&mdash;when all London quaked at the voice of
the storm,&mdash;the carpenter, who was exposed
to its utmost fury, fared better than might
have been anticipated. The boat in which
he rode was not overset. Fortunately, her
course had been shifted immediately after the
rescue of the child; and, in consequence of
this movement, she received the first shock
of the hurricane, which blew from the southwest,</pp>
<pb n="125">
<pp>upon her stern. Her head dipped deeply
into the current, and she narrowly escaped
being swamped. Righting, however, instantly
afterwards, she scudded with the greatest rapidity
over the boiling waves, to whose mercy
she was now entirely abandoned. On this fresh
outburst of the storm, Wood threw himself
instinctively into the bottom of the boat, and
clasping the little orphan to his breast, endeavoured
to prepare himself to meet his fate.</pp></p>
<p>While he was thus occupied, he felt a rough
grasp upon his arm, and presently afterwards
Ben's lips approached close to his ear. The
waterman sheltered his mouth with his hand
while he spoke, or his voice would have been
carried away by the violence of the blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's all up, master,&rdquo; groaned Ben, &ldquo;nothin'
short of a merracle can save us. The
boat's sure to run foul o' the bridge; and if
she'scapes stavin' above, she'll be swamped
to a sartainty below. There'll be a fall of
above twelve foot o' water, and think o' that
on a night as 'ud blow a whole fleet to the
devil.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="126">
<p>Mr. Wood <it>did</it> think of it, and groaned
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help us!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;we
were mad to neglect the old sailor's advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's what troubles me,&rdquo; rejoined Ben.
&ldquo;I tell'ee what, master, if you're more fortinate
nor I am, and get ashore, give old saltwater
your fare. I pledged my thumb that, dead
or alive, I'd pay the wager if I lost; and I
should like to be as good as my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;I will,&rdquo; replied Wood hastily.
&ldquo;Was that thunder?&rdquo; he faltered, as a terrible
clap was heard overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it's only a fresh gale,&rdquo; Ben returned:
&ldquo;hark! now it comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us, miserable sinners!&rdquo; 
ejaculated Wood, as a fearful gust
dashed the water over the side of the boat,
deluging him with spray.</p>
<p><pp>The hurricane had now reached its climax.
The blast shrieked, as if exulting in its wrathful
mission. Stunning and continuous, the din
seemed almost to take away the power of hearing.
He, who had faced the gale, would have</pp>
<pb n="127">
<pp>been instantly stifled. Piercing through every
crevice in the clothes, it, in some cases, tore
them from the wearer's limbs, or from his
grasp. It penetrated the skin; benumbed the
flesh; paralysed the faculties. The intense
darkness added to the terror of the storm. The
destroying angel hurried by, shrouded in his
gloomiest apparel. None saw, though all felt,
his presence, and heard the thunder of his
voice. Imagination, coloured by the obscurity,
peopled the air with phantoms. Ten
thousand steeds appeared to be trampling
aloft, charged with the work of devastation.
Awful shapes seemed to flit by, borne on the
wings of the tempest, animating and directing
its fury. The actual danger was lost sight of
in these wild apprehensions; and many timorous
beings were scared beyond reason's verge
by the excess of their fears.</pp></p>
<p>This had well nigh been the case with the
carpenter. He was roused from the stupor of
despair into which he had sunk by the voice of
Ben, who roared in his ear, &ldquo;The bridge!&mdash; 
the bridge!&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>London</smallcap>, at the period of this history, boasted
only a single bridge. But that bridge was more
remarkable than any the metropolis now possesses.
Covered with houses, from one end to the
other, this reverend and picturesque structure
presented the appearance of a street across the
Thames. It was as if Gracechurch Street,
with all its shops, its magazines, and ceaseless
throng of passengers, were stretched from the
Middlesex to the Surrey shore. The houses
were older, the shops gloomier, and the thoroughfare
narrower, it is true; but the bustle,
the crowd, the street&hyphen;like air was the same.
Then the bridge had arched gateways, bristling
with spikes, and garnished (as all ancient
gateways ought to be) with the heads of traitors.</pp>
<pb n="129">
<pp>In olden days it boasted a chapel, dedicated
to Saint Thomas; beneath which there
was a crypt curiously constructed amid the
arches, where &ldquo;was sepultured Peter the
Chaplain of Colechurch, who began the Stone
Bridge at London:&rdquo; and it still boasted an edifice
(though now in rather a tumbledown condition)
which had once vied with a palace,&mdash;we
mean Nonesuch House. The other buildings
stood close together in rows; and so valuable
was every inch of room accounted, that, in
many cases, cellars, and even habitable apartments,
were constructed in the solid masonry
of the piers.</pp></p>
<p>Old London Bridge (the grandsire of the
present erection) was supported on nineteen
arches, each of which
<lb><lg><l>Would a Rialto make for depth and height!</l></lg>
<lb>The arches stood upon enormous piers; the
piers on starlings, or jetties, built far out into
the river to break the force of the tide.</p>
<p><pp>Roused by Ben's warning, the carpenter looked
up, and could just perceive the dusky outline</pp>
<pb n="130">
<pp>of the bridge, looming through the darkness,
and rendered indistinctly visible by the
many lights that twinkled from the windows
of the lofty houses. As he gazed at these
lights, they suddenly seemed to disappear, and
a tremendous shock was felt throughout the
frame of the boat. Wood started to his feet.
He found that the skiff had been dashed
against one of the buttresses of the bridge.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; cried Ben, in a voice of thunder.</p>
<p><pp>Wood obeyed. His fears supplied him with
unwonted vigour. Though the starling was
more than two feet above the level of the water,
he alighted with his little charge&mdash;which he had
never for an instant quitted&mdash;in safety upon it.
Poor Ben was not so fortunate. Just as he
was preparing to follow, the wherry containing
Rowland and his men, which had drifted in
their wake, was dashed against his boat. The
violence of the collision nearly threw him backwards,
and caused him to swerve as he sprang.
His foot touched the rounded edge of the starling,
and glanced off, precipitating him into
the water. As he fell, he caught at the projecting</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>247Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010106">
<pb n="131">
<pp>masonry. But the stone was slippery; 
and the tide, which here began to feel the influence
of the fall, was running with frightful
velocity. He could not make good his hold.
But, uttering a loud cry, he was swept away
by the headlong torrent.</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood heard the cry. But his own situation
was too perilous to admit of his rendering
any assistance to the ill&hyphen;fated waterman.
He fancied, indeed, that he beheld a figure
spring upon the starling at the moment when
the boats came in contact; but, as he could
perceive no one near him, he concluded he
must have been mistaken.</p>
<p><pp>In order to make Mr. Wood's present position,
and subsequent proceedings fully intelligible,
it may be necessary to give some notion
of the shape and structure of the platform on
which he had taken refuge. It has been said,
that the pier of each arch, or lock of Old
London Bridge, was defended from the force
of the tide by a huge projecting spur called a
starling. These starlings varied in width, according
to the bulk of the pier they surrounded.</pp>
<pb n="132">
<pp>But they were all pretty nearly of
the same length, and built somewhat after the
model of a boat, having extremities as sharp
and pointed as the keel of a canoe. Cased
and ribbed with stone, and braced with horizontal
beams of timber, the piles, which formed
the foundation of these jetties, had resisted
the strong encroachments of the current for
centuries. Some of them are now buried at
the bottom of the Thames. The starling, on
which the carpenter stood, was the fourth
from the Surrey shore. It might be three
yards in width, and a few more in length; but
it was covered with ooze and slime, and the
waves continually broke over it. The transverse
spars before mentioned were as slippery
as ice; and the hollows between them were
filled ankle&hyphen;deep with water.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The carpenter threw himself flat upon the
starling to avoid the fury of the wind. But
in this posture he fared worse than ever. If
he ran less risk of being blown over, he stood
a much greater chance of being washed off, or
stifled. As he lay on his back, he fancied</pp>
<pb n="133">
<pp>himself gradually slipping off the platform.
Springing to his feet in an ecstacy of terror, he
stumbled, and had well nigh realized his worst
apprehensions. He, next, tried to clamber up
the flying buttresses and soffits of the pier,
in the hope of reaching some of the windows
and other apertures with which, as a man&hyphen;of&hyphen;war
is studded with port&hyphen;holes, the sides of the
bridge were pierced. But this wild scheme
was speedily abandoned; and, nerved by despair,
the carpenter resolved to hazard an attempt,
from the execution, almost from the
contemplation, of which he had hitherto shrunk.
This was to pass under the arch, along the
narrow ledge of the starling, and, if possible,
attain the eastern platform, where, protected
by the bridge, he would suffer less from the
excessive violence of the gale.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Assured, if he remained much longer where
he was, he would inevitably perish, Wood
recommended himself to the protection of
Heaven, and began his perilous course. Carefully
sustaining the child which, even in that
terrible extremity, he had not the heart to</pp>
<pb n="134">
<pp>abandon, he fell upon his knees, and, guiding
himself with his right hand, crept slowly on.
He had scarcely entered the arch, when the
indraught was so violent, and the noise of the
wind so dreadful and astounding, that he
almost determined to relinquish the undertaking.
But the love of life prevailed over his
fears. He went on.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The ledge, along which he crawled, was
about a foot wide. In length the arch exceeded
seventy feet. To the poor carpenter it
seemed an endless distance. When, by slow
and toilsome efforts, he had arrived midway,
something obstructed his further progress. It
was a huge stone placed there by some workmen
occupied in repairing the structure. Cold
drops stood upon Wood's brow, as he encountered
this obstacle. To return was impossible,
&mdash;to raise himself certain destruction. He
glanced downwards at the impetuous torrent,
which he could perceive shooting past him
with lightning swiftness in the gloom. He
listened to the thunder of the fall now mingling
with the roar of the blast; and, driven</pp>
<pb n="135">
<pp>almost frantic by what he heard and saw, he
pushed with all his force against the stone.
To his astonishment and delight it yielded to
the pressure, toppled over the ledge, and sank.
Such was the hubbub and tumult around him,
that the carpenter could not hear its plunge
into the flood. His course, however, was no
longer interrupted, and he crept on.</pp></p>
<p>After encountering other dangers, and being
twice compelled to fling himself flat upon his
face to avoid slipping from the wet and slimy
pathway, he was at length about to emerge
from the lock, when, to his inexpressible horror,
he found he had lost the child!</p>
<p><pp>All the blood in his veins rushed to his
heart, and he shook in every limb as he made
this discovery. A species of vertigo seized
him. His brain reeled. He fancied that the
whole fabric of the bridge was cracking overhead,
&mdash;that the arch was tumbling upon him,
&mdash;that the torrent was swelling around him,
whirling him off, and about to bury him in
the deafening abyss. He shrieked with agony,
and clung with desperate tenacity to the roughened</pp>
<pb n="136">
<pp>stones. But calmer thoughts quickly succeeded.
On taxing his recollection, the whole
circumstance rushed to mind with painful distinctness.
He remembered that, before he
attempted to dislodge the stone, he had placed
the child in a cavity of the pier, which the
granite mass had been intended to fill. This
obstacle being removed, in his eagerness to
proceed, he had forgotten to take his little
charge with him. It was still possible the
child might be in safety. And so bitterly did
the carpenter reproach himself with his neglect,
that he resolved, at all risks, to go back in
search of it. Acting upon this humane determination,
he impelled himself slowly backwards,
&mdash;for he did not dare to face the blast,&mdash; 
and with incredible labour and fatigue reached
the crevice. His perseverance was amply rewarded.
The child was still safe. It lay undisturbed
in the remotest corner of the recess.</pp></p>
<p><pp>So overjoyed was the carpenter with the
successful issue of his undertaking, that he
scarcely paused a moment to recruit himself; 
but, securing the child, set out upon his return.</pp>
<pb n="137">
<pp>Retracing his steps, he arrived, without
further accident, at the eastern platform of the
starling. As he anticipated, he was here comparatively
screened from the fury of the wind; 
and when he gazed upon the roaring fall beneath
him, visible through the darkness in a
glistening sheet of foam, his heart overflowed
with gratitude for his providential deliverance.</pp></p>
<p><pp>As he moved about upon the starling, Mr.
Wood became sensible that he was not alone.
Some one was standing beside him. This,
then, must be the person whom he had seen
spring upon the western platform at the time
of the collision between the boats. The carpenter
well knew from the obstacle which had
interfered with his own progress, that the unknown
could not have passed through the same
lock as himself. But he might have crept
along the left side of the pier, and beneath
the further arch; whereas, Wood, as we have
seen, took his course upon the right. The
darkness prevented the carpenter from discerning
the features or figure of the stranger; and
the ceaseless din precluded the possibility of</pp>
<pb n="138">
<pp>holding any communication by words with him.
Wood, however, made known his presence to
the individual by laying his hand upon his
shoulder. The stranger started at the touch,
and spoke. But his words were borne away
by the driving wind.</pp></p>
<p>Finding all attempts at conversation with his
companion in misfortune in vain, Wood, in
order to distract his thoughts, looked up at
the gigantic structure standing, like a wall of
solid darkness, before him. What was his
transport on perceiving that a few yards above
him a light was burning. The carpenter did
not hesitate a moment. He took a handful
of the gravelly mud, with which the platform
was covered, and threw the small pebbles, one
by one, towards the gleam. A pane of glass
was shivered by each stone. The signal of
distress was evidently understood. The light
disappeared. The window was shortly after
opened, and a rope ladder, with a lighted horn
lantern attached to it, let down.</p>
<p><pp>Wood grasped his companion's arm to attract
his attention to this unexpected means</pp>
<pb n="139">
<pp>of escape. The ladder was now within reach.
Both advanced towards it, when, by the light
of the lantern, Wood beheld, in the countenance
of the stranger, the well&hyphen;remembered and
stern features of Rowland.</pp></p>
<p>The carpenter trembled; for he perceived
Rowland's gaze fixed first upon the infant,
and then on himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <it>is</it> her child!&rdquo; shrieked Rowland, in
a voice heard above the howling of the tempest,
&ldquo;risen from this roaring abyss to torment me.
Its parents have perished. And shall their
wretched offspring live to blight my hopes,
and blast my fame? Never!&rdquo; And, with
these words, he grasped Wood by the throat,
and, despite his resistance dragged him to the
very verge of the platform.</p>
<p>At this juncture, a thundering crash was
heard against the side of the bridge. A stack
of chimneys, on the house above them, had
yielded to the storm, and descended in a
shower of bricks and stones.</p>
<p><pp>When the carpenter a moment afterwards
stretched out his hand, scarcely knowing whether</pp>
<pb n="140">
<pp>he was alive or dead, he found himself
alone. The fatal shower, from which he and
his little charge escaped uninjured, had stricken
his assailant and precipitated him into the
boiling gulf.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It's an ill wind that blows nobody good,&rdquo; 
thought the carpenter, turning his attention
to the child, whose feeble struggles and cries
proclaimed that, as yet, life had not been extinguished
by the hardships it had undergone.
&ldquo;Poor little creature!&rdquo; he muttered, pressing
it tenderly to his breast, as he grasped the rope
and clambered up to the window: &ldquo;if thou
hast, indeed, lost both thy parents, as that
terrible man said just now, thou art not wholly
friendless and deserted; for I myself will be
a father to thee! And in memory of this
dreadful night, and the death from which I
have been the means of preserving thee, thou
shalt bear the name of THAMES <smallcap>Darrell.</smallcap>&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>No sooner had Wood crept through the
window, than nature gave way, and he fainted.
On coming to himself, he found he had been
wrapped in a blanket and put to bed with a</pp>
<pb n="141">
<pp>couple of hot bricks to his feet. His first inquiries
were concerning the child, and he was
delighted to find that it still lived and was
doing well. Every care had been taken of
it, as well as of himself, by the humane inmates
of the house in which he had sought
shelter.</pp></p>
<p>About noon, next day, he was able to move; 
and the gale having abated, he set out homewards
with his little charge.</p>
<p><pp>The city presented a terrible picture of devastation.
London Bridge had suffered a degree
less than most places. But it was almost
choked up with fallen stacks of chimneys, broken
beams of timber, and shattered tiles. The
houses overhung in a frightful manner, and
looked as if the next gust would precipitate
them into the river. With great difficulty,
Wood forced a path through the ruins. It
was a work of no slight danger, for every
instant a wall, or fragment of a building,
came crashing to the ground. Thames Street
was wholly impassable. Men were going hither
and thither with barrows, and ladders and</pp>
<pb n="142">
<pp>ropes, removing the rubbish, and trying to
support the tottering habitations. Gracechurch
Street was entirely deserted, except by a few
stragglers, whose curiosity got the better of
their fears; or who, like the carpenter, were
compelled to proceed along it. The tiles
lay a foot thick in the road. In some cases
they were ground almost to powder; in others,
driven deeply into the earth, as if discharged
from a piece of ordnance. The roofs and
gables of many of the houses had been torn off.
The signs of the shops were carried to incredible
distances. Here and there, a building
might be seen with the doors and windows
driven in, and all access to it prevented by the
heaps of bricks and tilesherds.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Through this confusion the carpenter struggled
on;&mdash;now ascending, now descending the
different mountains of rubbish that beset his
path, at the imminent peril of his life and
limbs, until he arrived in Fleet Street. The
hurricane appeared to have raged in this
quarter with tenfold fury. Mr. Wood scarcely
knew where he was. The old aspect of the</pp>
<pb n="143">
<pp>place was gone. In lieu of the substantial
habitations which he had gazed on overnight,
he beheld a row of falling scaffoldings, for such
they seemed.</pp></p>
<p><pp>It was a dismal and depressing sight to see
a great city thus suddenly overthrown; and
the carpenter was deeply moved by the spectacle.
As usual, however, on the occasion of
any great calamity, a crowd was scouring the
streets, whose sole object was plunder. While
involved in this crowd, near Temple Bar,&mdash; 
where the thoroughfare was most dangerous
from the masses of ruin that impeded it,&mdash; 
an individual, whose swarthy features recalled
to the carpenter one of his tormentors of the
previous night, collared him, and, with bitter
imprecations, accused him of stealing his child.
In vain Wood protested his innocence. The
ruffian's companions took his part. And the
infant, in all probability, would have been
snatched from its preserver, if a posse of the
watch (sent out to maintain order and protect
property) had not opportunely arrived,
and by a vigorous application of their halberts</pp>
<pb n="144">
<pp>dispersed his persecutors, and set him at liberty.</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood then took to his heels, and never
once looked behind him till he reached his own
dwelling in Wych Street. His wife met him
at the door, and into her hands he delivered
his little charge.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Twelve years</smallcap>! How many events have
occurred during that long interval! how many
changes have taken place! The whole aspect
of things is altered. The child has sprung
into a youth; the youth has become a man; 
the man has already begun to feel the advances
of age. Beauty has bloomed and
faded. Fresh flowers of loveliness have budded,
expanded, died. The fashions of the
day have become antiquated. New customs
have prevailed over the old. Parties, politics,
and popular opinions have changed. The
crown has passed from the brow of one monarch
to that of another. Habits and tastes
are no longer the same. We, ourselves, are
scarcely the same we were twelve years ago.</p>
<pb n="148">
<p>Twelve years ago! It is an awful retrospect.
Dare we look back upon the darkened
vista, and, in imagination, retrace the path
we have trod? With how many vain hopes
is it shaded! with how many good resolutions,
never fulfilled, is it paved! Where are the
dreams of ambition in which, twelve years
ago, we indulged? Where are the aspirations
that fired us&mdash;the passions that consumed
us then? Has our success in life been
commensurate with our own desires&mdash;with the
anticipations formed of us by others? Or,
are we not blighted in heart, as in ambition?
Has not the loved one been estranged by
doubt, or snatched from us by the cold hand
of death? Is not the goal, towards which
we pressed, further off than ever&mdash;the prospect
before us cheerless as the blank behind?
&mdash;Enough of this. Let us proceed with our
tale.</p>
<p><pp>Twelve years, then, have elapsed since the
date of occurrences detailed in the preceding
division of this history. At that time,
we were beneath the sway of Anne: we are</pp>
<pb n="149">
<pp>now at the commencement of the reign of
George the First. Passing at a glance over
the whole of the intervening period; leaving,
in the words of the poet,
<lb><lg><l align="r">&mdash;The growth untried</l>
<l>Of that wide gap&mdash;</l></lg>
<lb>we shall resume our narrative at the beginning
of June, 1715.</pp></p>
<p>One Friday afternoon, in this pleasant month,
it chanced that Mr. Wood, who had been absent
on business during the greater part of the
day, returned (perhaps not altogether undesignedly)
at an earlier hour than was expected.
to his dwelling in Wych Street, Drury Lane; 
and was about to enter his workshop, when, not
hearing any sound of labour issue from within,
he began to suspect that an apprentice, of whose
habits of industry he entertained some doubt,
was neglecting his employment. Impressed
with this idea, he paused for a moment to
listen. But finding all continue silent, he
cautiously lifted the latch, and crept into the
room, resolved to punish the offender in case
his suspicions should prove correct.</p>
<pb n="150">
<p><pp>The chamber, into which he stole, like all
carpenters' workshops, was crowded with the
implements and materials of that ancient and
honourable art. Saws, hammers, planes, axes,
augers, adzes, chisels, gimblets, and an endless
variety of tools were ranged, like a stand of
martial weapons at an armoury, in racks against
the walls. Over these hung levels, bevels,
squares, and other instruments of measurement.
Amid a litter of nails without heads,
screws without worms, and locks without wards,
lay a glue&hyphen;pot and an oilstone, two articles
which their owner was wont to term &ldquo;his
right hand and his left.&rdquo; On a shelf was
placed a row of paint&hyphen;jars; the contents of
which had been daubed in rainbow streaks
upon the adjacent closet and window sill.
Divers plans and figures were chalked upon
the walls; and the spaces between them were
filled up with an almanack for the year; a
godly ballad, adorned with a rude wood&hyphen;cut,
purporting to be &ldquo;<it>The History of Chaste
Susannah</it>;&rdquo; an old print of the Seven Golden
Candlesticks; an abstract of the various Acts</pp>
<pb n="151">
<pp>of Parliament against drinking, swearing, and
all manner of profaneness; and a view of the
interior of Doctor Daniel Burgess's Presbyterian
meeting&hyphen;house in Russell Court, with
portraits of the reverend gentleman and the
principal members of his flock. The floor
was thickly strewn with sawdust and shavings; 
and across the room ran a long and wide bench,
furnished at one end with a powerful vice; 
next to which three nails driven into the
boards served, it would appear from the lump
of unconsumed tallow left in their custody,
as a substitute for a candlestick. On the
bench was set a quartern measure of gin, a
crust of bread, and a slice of cheese. Attracted
by the odour of the latter dainty, a
hungry cat had contrived to scratch open the
paper in which it was wrapped, displaying
the following words in large characters:&mdash; 
&ldquo;<smallcap>The History of the Four Kings, or Child's
best Guide to the Gallows.</smallcap>&rdquo; And, as if to
make the moral more obvious, a dirty pack
of cards was scattered, underneath, upon the
sawdust. Near the door stood a pile of deal</pp>
<pb n="152">
<pp>planks, behind which the carpenter ensconced
himself, in order to reconnoitre, unobserved,
the proceedings of his idle apprentice.</pp></p>
<p>Standing on tiptoe, on a joint&hyphen;stool, placed
upon the bench, with his back to the door,
and a clasp&hyphen;knife in his hand, this youngster,
instead of executing his appointed task, was
occupied in carving his name upon a beam,
overhead. Boys, at the time of which we write,
were attired like men of their own day, or certain
charity&hyphen;children of ours; and the stripling
in question was dressed in black plush breeches,
and a grey drugget waistcoat, with immoderately
long pockets, both of which were evidently
the cast&hyphen;off clothes of some one considerably
his senior. Coat, on the present occasion,
he had none, it being more convenient, as well
as agreeable to him, to pursue his avocations in
his shirt&hyphen;sleeves; but, when fully equipped, he
wore a large cuffed, long&hyphen;skirted garment, which
had once been the property of his master.</p>
<p><pp>In concealing himself behind the timber, Mr.
Wood could not avoid making a slight shuffling
sound. The noise startled the apprentice, who</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>345Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010107">
<pb n="153">
<pp>instantly suspended his labour, and gazed
anxiously in the direction whence he supposed
it proceeded. His face was that of a quick, intelligent&hyphen; 
looking boy, with fine hazel eyes, and
a clear olive complexion. His figure was uncommonly
slim even for his age, which could
not be more than thirteen; and the looseness of
his garb made him appear thinner than he was
in reality. But if his frame was immature, his
looks were not so. He seemed to possess a
penetration and cunning beyond his years&mdash;to
hide a man's judgment under a boy's mask.
The glance, which he threw at the door, was
singularly expressive of his character: it was
a mixture of alarm, effrontery, and resolution.
In the end, resolution triumphed, as it was sure
to do, over the weaker emotions, and he laughed
at his fears. The only part of his otherwise&hyphen;interesting
countenance, to which one could decidedly
object, was the mouth; a feature that,
more than any other, is conceived to betray the
animal propensities of the possessor. If this is
true, it must be owned that the boy's mouth
showed a strong tendency on his part to coarse</pp>
<pb n="154">
<pp>indulgence. The eyes, too, though large and
bright, and shaded by long lashes, seemed to
betoken, as hazel eyes generally do in men, a
faithless and uncertain disposition. The cheekbone
were prominent: the nose slightly depressed,
with rather wide nostrils; the chin
narrow, but well&hyphen;formed; the forehead broad
and lofty; and he possessed such an extraordinary
flexibility of muscle in this region, that he
could elevate his eye&hyphen;brows at pleasure up to
the very verge of his sleek and shining black
hair, which, being closely cropped, to admit of
his occasionally wearing a wig, gave a singular
bullet&hyphen;shape to his head. Taken altogether, his
physiognomy resembled one of those vagabond
heads which Murillo delighted to paint, and for
which Guzman d'Alfarache, Lazarillo de Tormes,
or Estevanillo Gonzalez might have sat:&mdash; 
faces that almost make one in love with roguery,
they seem so full of vivacity and enjoyment.
There was all the knavery, and more than all
the drollery of a Spanish picaroon in the laughing
eyes of the English apprentice; and, with a
little more warmth and sunniness of skin on the</pp>
<pb n="155">
<pp>side of the latter, the resemblance between them
would have been complete.</pp></p>
<p>Satisfied, as he thought, that he had nothing
to apprehend, the boy resumed his task, chanting,
as he plied his knife with redoubled assiduity,
the following&mdash;not inappropriate
strains:&mdash; 
<lb><caption>THE NEWGATE STONE.</caption>
<lg><l><smallcap>When Claude du Val</smallcap> was in Newgate thrown,</l>
<l>He carved his name on the dungeon stone;</l>
<l>Quoth a dubsman, who gazed on the shattered wall,</l>
<l>&ldquo;You have carved your epitaph, <smallcap>Claude du Val</smallcap>,</l>
<l align="r"><it>With your chisel so fine, tra la</it>!&rdquo;</l></lg></p>
<lb><p>&ldquo;This S wants a little deepening,&rdquo; mused
the apprentice, retouching the letter in question; 
&ldquo;ay, that's better.&rdquo; 
<lb><lg><l><smallcap>Du Val</smallcap> was hang'd, and the next who came</l>
<l>On the selfsame stone inscribed his name:</l>
<l>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; quoth the dubsman, with devilish glee,</l>
<l>&ldquo;<smallcap>Tom Waters</smallcap>, <it>your</it> doom is the triple tree!</l>
<l align="r"><it>With your chisel so fine, tra la</it>!&rdquo;</l></lg></p>
<lb><p><pp>&ldquo;Tut, tut, tut,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what a fool I
am to be sure! I ought to have cut John, not
Jack. However, it don't signify. Nobody ever
called me John, that I recollect. So I dare say</pp>
<pb n="156">
<pp>I was christened Jack. Deuce take it! I was
very near spelling my name with one P.
<lb><lg><l>Within that dungeon lay <smallcap>Captain Bew</smallcap>,</l>
<l><smallcap>Rumbold</smallcap> and <smallcap>Whitney</smallcap>&mdash;a jolly crew!</l>
<l>All carved their names on the stone, and all</l>
<l>Share the fate of the brave <smallcap>Du Val</smallcap>!</l>
<l align="r"><it>With their chisels so fine, tra la</it>!</l></lg></pp></p>
<lb><p>&ldquo;Save us!&rdquo; continued the apprentice, &ldquo;I
hope this beam doesn't resemble the Newgate
stone; or I may chance, like the great men the
song speaks of, to swing on the Tyburn tree for
my pains. No fear o' that.&mdash;Though if my
name should become as famous as theirs, it
wouldn't much matter. The prospect of the
gallows would never deter me from taking to
the road, if I were so inclined.</p>
<lb><lg><l>Full twenty highwaymen blithe and bold,</l>
<l>Rattled their chains in that dungeon old;</l>
<l>Of all that number there 'scaped not one</l>
<l>Who carved his name on the Newgate Stone,</l>
<l align="r"><it>With his chisel so fine, tra la</it>!</l></lg>
<lb><p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried the boy, leaping from the
stool, and drawing back a few paces on the
bench to examine his performance,&mdash;&ldquo;that'll
do. Claude du Val, himself, couldn't have
carved it better&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="157">
<p>The name inscribed upon the beam (of
which, as it has been carefully preserved by
the subsequent owners of Mr. Wood's habitation
in Wych Street, we are luckily enabled
to furnish a fac&hyphen;simile) was</p>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>28Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010108">
<p>&ldquo;I've half a mind to give old Wood the
slip, and turn highwayman,&rdquo; cried Jack, as he
closed the knife, and put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil you have!&rdquo; thundered a voice
from behind, that filled the apprentice with
dismay. &ldquo;Come down, sirrah, and I'll teach
you how to deface my walls in future. Come
down, I say, instantly, or I'll make you.&rdquo; 
Upon which, Mr. Wood caught hold of Jack's
leg, and dragged him off the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you'll turn highwayman, will
you, you young dog?&rdquo; continued the carpenter,
cuffing him soundly,&mdash;&ldquo;rob the mails,
like Jack Hall, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="158">
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; replied Jack sullenly, &ldquo;if
you beat me in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazed at the boy's assurance, Wood left
off boxing his ears for a moment, and, looking
at him steadfastly, said in a grave tone, &ldquo;Jack,
Jack, you'll come to be hanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better be hanged than henpecked,&rdquo; retorted
the lad with a malicious grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, sirrah?&rdquo; 
cried Wood, reddening with anger. &ldquo;Do you
dare to insinuate that Mrs. Wood governs
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's plain you can't govern yourself, at
all events,&rdquo; replied Jack coolly; &ldquo;but, be that
as it may, I won't be struck for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; echoed Wood furiously. &ldquo;Do
you call neglecting your work, and singing
flash songs nothing? Is your recent idle discourse,
and your present unblushing insolence
nothing? Zounds! you incorrigible rascal,
many a master would have taken you before
a magistrate, and prayed for your solitary
confinement in Bridewell for the least of these
offences. But I'll be more lenient, and content</pp>
<pb n="159">
<pp>myself with merely chastising you, on
condition&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;You may do as you please, master,&rdquo; interrupted
Jack, thrusting his hand into his
pocket, as if in search of the knife; &ldquo;but I
wouldn't advise you to lay hands on me again.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood glanced at the hardy offender,
and not liking the expression of his countenance,
thought it advisable to post one the
execution of his threats to a more favourable
opportunity. So, by way of gaining time, he
resolved to question him further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn the song I heard just
now?&rdquo; he demanded, in an authoritative tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Black Lion in our street,&rdquo; replied
Jack, without hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst house in the neighbourhood&mdash; 
the constant haunt of reprobates and thieves,&rdquo; 
groaned Wood. &ldquo;And who taught it you&mdash; 
the landlord, Joe Hind?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No; one Blueskin, a fellow who frequents
the Lion,&rdquo; answered Jack, with a degree of
candour that astonished his master nearly as
much as his confidence. &ldquo;It was that song</pp>
<pb n="160">
<pp>that put it into my head to cut my name on
the beam.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;A white wall is a fool's paper, Jack,&mdash; 
remember that,&rdquo; rejoined Wood. &ldquo;Pretty
company for an apprentice to keep!&mdash;pretty
houses for an apprentice to frequent! Why,
the rascal you mention is a notorious housebreaker.
He was tried at the last Old Bailey
sessions; and only escaped the gallows by impeaching
his accomplices. Jonathan Wild
brought him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know Jonathan Wild,
master?&rdquo; inquired Jack, altering his tone, and
assuming a more respectful demeanour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've seen him some years ago, I believe,&rdquo; 
answered Wood; &ldquo;and, though he must be
much changed by this time, I dare say I
should know him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short man, isn't he, about your height,
sir,&mdash;with a yellow beard, and a face as sly as
a fox's?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; replied Wood, coughing slightly
to conceal a smile; &ldquo;the description's not
amiss. But why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="161">
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; stammered the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak out&mdash;don't be alarmed,&rdquo; said Wood,
in a kind and encouraging tone. &ldquo;If you've
done wrong, confess it, and I'll forgive you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't deserve to be forgiven!&rdquo; returned
Jack, bursting into tears; &ldquo;for I'm afraid
I've done very wrong. Do you know this,
sir?&rdquo; he added, taking a key from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it!&rdquo; asked Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was given me by a man who was drinking
t'other night with Blueskin at the Lion!
and who, though he slouched his hat over his
eyes, and muffled his chin in a handkerchief,
must have been Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did <it>he</it> get it?&rdquo; inquired Wood, in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can't say. But he promised to
give me a couple of guineas if I'd ascertain
whether it fitted your locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Wood; &ldquo;it's my
old master&hyphen;key. This key,&rdquo; he added, taking
it from the boy, &ldquo;was purloined from me
by your father, Jack. What he intended to
do with it is of little consequence now. But</pp>
<pb n="162">
<pp>before he suffered at Tyburn, he charged your
mother to restore it. She lost it in the Mint.
Jonathan Wild must have stolen it from her.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;He must,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, hastily; &ldquo;but
only let me have it till to&hyphen;morrow, and if I
don't entrap him in a snare from which, with
all his cunning, he shall find it difficult to
escape, my name's not Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I see through your design, Jack,&rdquo; returned
the carpenter, gravely; &ldquo;But I don't like under&hyphen;hand
work. Even when you've a knave
to deal with, let your actions be plain, and
above&hyphen;board. That's my maxim; and it's the
maxim of every honest man. It would be a
great matter, I must own, to bring Jonathan
Wild to justice. But I can't consent to the
course you would pursue&mdash;at least, not till
I've given it due consideration. In regard to
yourself, you've had a very narrow escape.
Wild's intention, doubtless, was to use you
as far as he found necessary, and then to sell
you. Let this be a caution to you in future&mdash; 
with whom, and about what you deal. We're
told, that &lsquo;Whoso is partner with a thief</pp>
<pb n="163">
<pp>hateth his own soul.&rsquo; Avoid taverns and bad
company, and you may yet do well. You
promise to become a first&hyphen;rate workman. But
you want one quality, without which all others
are valueless. You want industry&mdash;you want
steadiness. Idleness is the key of beggary,
Jack. If you don't conquer this disgraceful
propensity in time, you'll soon come to want; 
and then nothing can save you. Be warned by
your father's fate. As you brew so must you
drink. I've engaged to watch over you as
a son, and I <it>will</it> do so as far as I'm able; 
but if you neglect my advice, what chance
have I of benefitting you? On one point
I've made up my mind&mdash;you shall either obey
me, or leave me. Please yourself. Here are
your indentures, if you choose to seek another
master.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>will</it> obey you, master,&mdash;indeed I will!&rdquo; 
implored Jack, seriously alarmed at the carpenter's
calm displeasure.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;We shall see. Good words, without deeds,
are rushes and reeds. And now take away
those cards, and never let me see them again.</pp>
<pb n="164">
<pp>Drive away the cat; throw that measure of gin
through the window; and tell me why you've
not so much as touched the packing&hyphen;case for
Lady Trafford, which I particularly desired
you to complete against my return. It must
be sent home this evening. She leaves town
to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be ready in two hours,&rdquo; answered
Jack, seizing a piece of wood and a plane; &ldquo;it
isn't more than four o'clock. I'll engage to
get the job done by six. I didn't expect
you home before that hour, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jack,&rdquo; said Wood, shaking his head,
&ldquo;where there's a will there's a way. You
can do anything you please. I wish I could
get you to imitate Thames Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I understand the business of a
carpenter much better than he does,&rdquo; replied
Jack, adroitly adjusting the board, and using
the plane with the greatest rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Wood, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames was always your favourite,&rdquo; observed
Jack, as he fastened another piece of
wood on the teeth of the iron stopper.</p>
<pb n="165">
<p>&ldquo;I've made no distinction between you,
hitherto,&rdquo; answered Wood; &ldquo;nor shall I do
so, unless I'm compelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've had the hard work to do, at all
events,&rdquo; rejoined Jack. &ldquo;But I won't complain.
I'd do anything for Thames Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Thames Darrell would do anything
for you, Jack,&rdquo; replied a blithe voice. &ldquo;What's
the matter, father?&rdquo; continued the new&hyphen;comer,
addressing Wood. &ldquo;Has Jack displeased you?
If so, overlook his fault this once. I'm sure he'll
do his best to content you. Won't you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; answered Sheppard, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it thunders, the thief becomes
honest,&rdquo; muttered Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help you, Jack?&rdquo; asked Thames,
taking up a plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, let him alone,&rdquo; interposed Wood.
&ldquo;He has undertaken to finish this job by six
o'clock, and I wish to see whether he'll be
as good as his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He'll have hard work to do it by that
time, father,&rdquo; remonstrated Thames; &ldquo;you'd
better let me help him.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="166">
<p>&ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; rejoined Wood peremptorily.
&ldquo;A little extra exertion will teach him
the advantage of diligence at the proper season.
Lost ground must be regained. I need scarcely
ask whether you've executed your appointed
task, my dear? You're never behindhand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thames turned away at the question, which
he felt might be construed into a reproach.
But Sheppard answered for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell's job was done early this morning,&rdquo; 
he said; &ldquo;and if I'd attended to his advice,
the packing&hyphen;case would have been finished at
the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You trusted too much to your own skill,
Jack,&rdquo; rejoined Thames. &ldquo;If I could work
as fast as you, I might afford to be as idle.
See how he gets on, father,&rdquo; he added, appealing
to Wood: &ldquo;the box seems to grow under
his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're a noble&hyphen;hearted little fellow,
Thames,&rdquo; rejoined Wood, casting a look of
pride and affection at his adopted son, whose
head he gently patted; &ldquo;and give promise of
a glorious manhood.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="167">
<p><pp>Thames Darrell was, indeed, a youth of
whom a person of far greater wordly consequence
than the worthy carpenter might have
been justly proud. Though a few&hyphen;months
younger than his companion Jack Sheppard,
he was half a head taller, and much more
robustly formed. The two friends contrasted
strikingly with each other. In Darrell's open
features, frankness and honour were written
in legible characters; while, in Jack's physiognomy,
cunning and knavery were as
strongly imprinted. In all other respects
they differed as materially. Jack could hardly
be accounted good&hyphen;looking: Thames, on
the contrary, was one of the handsomest boys
possible. Jack's complexion was that of a
gipsy; Darrell's as fresh and bright as a rose.
Jack's mouth was coarse and large; Darrell's
small and exquisitely carved, with the short,
proud upper lip, which belongs to the highest
order of beauty. Jack's nose was broad and
flat; Darrell's straight and fine as that of
Antinous. The expression pervading the
countenance of the one was vulgarity; of the</pp>
<pb n="168">
<pp>other, that which is rarely found, except in
persons of high birth. Darrell's eyes were
of that clear grey which it is difficult to distinguish
from blue by day and black at night; 
and his rich brown hair, which he could not
consent to part with, even on the promise of
a new and modish peruke from his adoptive
father, fell in thick glossy ringlets upon his
shoulders; whereas Jack's close black crop
imparted the peculiar bullet&hyphen;shape we have
noticed, to his head.</pp></p>
<p>While Thames modestly expressed a hope
that he might not belie the carpenter's favourable
prediction, Jack Sheppard thought fit to
mount a small ladder placed against the wall,
and, springing with the agility of an ape upon
a sort of frame, contrived to sustain short spars
and blocks of timber, began to search about for
a piece of wood required in the work on which
he was engaged. Being in a great hurry, he
took little heed where he set his feet; and a
board giving way, he must have fallen, if he
had not grasped a large plank laid upon the
transverse beam immediately over his head.</p>
<pb n="169">
<p>&ldquo;Take care, Jack,&rdquo; shouted Thames, who
witnessed the occurrence; &ldquo;that plank isn't
properly balanced. You'll have it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the caution came too late. Sheppard's
weight had destroyed the equilibrium of the
plank: it swerved, and slowly descended.
Losing his presence of mind, Jack quitted
his hold, and dropped upon the frame. The
plank hung over his head. A moment more
and he would have been crushed beneath the
ponderous board, when a slight but strong arm
arrested its descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get from under it, Jack!&rdquo; vociferated
Thames. &ldquo;I can't hold it much longer&mdash;it'll
break my wrist. Down we come!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
letting go the plank, which fell with a
crash, and leaping after Sheppard, who had
rolled off the frame.</p>
<p>All this was the work of a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bones broken, I hope,&rdquo; said Thames,
laughing at Jack, who limped towards the
bench, rubbing his shins as he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Sheppard, with affected
indifference.</p>
<pb n="170">
<p>&ldquo;It's a mercy you both escaped!&rdquo; ejaculated
Wood, only just finding his tongue. &ldquo;I declare
I'm all in a cold sweat. How came you,
sir,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Sheppard, &ldquo;to
venture upon that frame. I always told you
some accident would happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't scold him, father,&rdquo; interposed
Thames; &ldquo;he's been frightened enough already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, since you desire it, I'll say no
more,&rdquo; returned Wood. &ldquo;You hav'n't hurt
your arm, I trust, my dear?&rdquo; he added, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sprained it a little, that's all,&rdquo; answered
Thames; &ldquo;the pain will go off presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you <it>are</it> hurt,&rdquo; cried the carpenter in
alarm. &ldquo;Come down stairs directly, and let
your mother look at your wrist. She has an
excellent remedy for a sprain. And do you,
Jack, attend to your work, and mind you don't
get into further mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn't Jack better go with us?&rdquo; said
Thames. &ldquo;His shin may need rubbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; rejoined Wood, hastily.</pp>
<pb n="171">
<pp>&ldquo;A little suffering will do him good. I meant
to give him a drubbing. That bruise will answer
the same purpose.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames,&rdquo; said Sheppard in a low voice, as
he threw a vindictive glance at the carpenter,
&ldquo;I shan't forget this. You've saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! you'd do as much for me any
day, and think no more about it. It'll be your
turn to save mine next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, and I shan't be easy till my turn arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, Jack,&rdquo; whispered Thames,
who had noticed Sheppard's menacing glance,
and dreaded some further indiscretion on his
part, &ldquo;if you really wish to oblige me, you'll
get that packing&hyphen;case finished by six o'clock.
You <it>can</it> do it, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I <it>will</it>, if I can, depend upon it,&rdquo; answered
Sheppard, with a laugh.</p>
<p>So saying, he manfully resumed his work; 
while Wood and Thames quitted the room, and
went down stairs.</p></div4>

CHAPTER II.

<p><smallcap>Thames Darrell's</smallcap> arm having been submitted
to the scrutiny of Mrs. Wood, was pronounced
by that lady to be very much sprained; 
and she, forthwith, proceeded to bathe it
with a reddish&hyphen;coloured lotion. During this
operation, the carpenter underwent a severe
catechism as to the cause of the accident; and,
on learning that the mischance originated with
Jack Sheppard, the indignation of his helpmate
knew no bounds; and she was with difficulty
prevented from flying to the workshop to inflict
summary punishment on the offender.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I knew how it would be,&rdquo; she cried, in the
shrill voice peculiar to a shrew, &ldquo;when you
brought that worthless hussy's worthless brat
into the house. I told you no good would</pp>
<pb n="173">
<pp>come of it. And every day's experience proves
that I was right. But, like all your overbearing
sex, you must have your own way.
You'll never be guided by me&mdash;never!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my love, you're entirely mistaken,&rdquo; 
returned the carpenter, endeavouring to deprecate
his wife's rising resentment by the softest
looks, and the meekest deportment.</p>
<p>So far, however, was this submission from
producing the desired effect, that it seemed
only to lend additional fuel to her displeasure.
Forgetting her occupation in her anger, she
left off bathing Darrell's wrist; and, squeezing
his arm so tightly that the boy winced with
pain, she clapped her right hand upon her hip,
and turned, with flashing eyes and an inflamed
countenance, towards her crest&hyphen;fallen spouse.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed, almost choked
with passion,&mdash;&ldquo;<it>I</it> advised you to burthen yourself
with that idle and good&hyphen;for&hyphen;nothing pauper,
whom you ought rather to send to the workhouse
than maintain at your own expense, did
I? <it>I</it> advised you to take him as an apprentice; 
and, so far from getting the regular fee</pp>
<pb n="174">
<pp>with him, to give him a salary? <it>I</it> advised
you to feed him, and clothe him, and treat him
like his betters; to put up with his insolence,
and wink at his faults? <it>I</it> counselled all this,
I suppose. You'll tell me next, I dare say,
that I recommended you to go and visit his
mother so frequently under the plea of charity; 
to give her wine, and provisions, and money; 
to remove her from the only fit quarters for
such people&mdash;the Mint; and to place her in a
cottage at Willesden, of which you must needs
pay the rent? Marry, come up! charity should
begin at home. A discreet husband would
leave the dispensation of his bounty, where
women are concerned, to his wife. And for my
part, if I were inclined to exercise my benevolence
at all, it should be in favour of some
more deserving object than that whining, hypocritical
Magdalene.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It was the knowledge of this feeling on
your part, my love, that made me act without
your express sanction. I did all for the best,
I'm sure. Mrs. Sheppard is&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;I know what Mrs. Sheppard is, without</pp>
<pb n="175">
<pp>your information, sir. I haven't forgotten her
previous history. You've your own reasons,
no doubt, for bringing up her son&mdash;perhaps, I
ought rather to say <it>your</it> son, Mr. Wood.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my love, these accusations are
most groundless&mdash;this violence is most unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't endure the odious baggage. I
hope I may never come near her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you never may, my love,&rdquo; humbly
acquiesced the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my house to be made a receptacle for all
your natural children, sir? Answer me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winny,&rdquo; said Thames, whose glowing
cheek attested the effect produced upon him by
the insinuation; &ldquo;Winny,&rdquo; said he, addressing
a pretty little damsel of some twelve years of
age, who stood by his side holding the bottle
of embrocation, &ldquo;help me on with my coat,
please. This is no place for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Sit down, my dear, sit down,&rdquo; interposed
Mrs. Wood, softening her asperity. &ldquo;What
I said about natural children doesn't apply to
<it>you</it>. Don't suppose,&rdquo; she added, with a scornful</pp>
<pb n="176">
<pp>glance at her helpmate, &ldquo;that I would pay
him the compliment of thinking he could possibly
be the father of such a boy as you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood lifted up his hands in mute despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owen, Owen,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Wood, sinking
into a chair, and fanning herself violently,
&mdash;&ldquo;what a fluster you have put me into with
your violence, to be sure! And at the very
time, too, when you know I'm expecting a
visit from Mr. Kneebone, on his return from
Manchester. I wouldn't have him see me in
this state for the world. He'd never forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poh, poh, my dear! Mr. Kneebone invariably
takes part with me, when any trifling
misunderstanding arises between us. I only
wish he was not a Papist and a Jacobite.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Jacobite!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Wood. &ldquo;Marry,
come up! Mightn't he just as reasonably
complain of your being a Hanoverian and a
Presbyterian? It's all matter of opinion. And
now, my love,&rdquo; she added, with a relenting
look, &ldquo;I'm content to make up our quarrel.</pp>
<pb n="177">
<pp>But you must promise me not to go near that
abandoned hussy at Willesden. One can't
help being jealous, you know, even of an unworthy
object.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Glad to make peace on any terms, Mr. Wood
gave the required promise, though he could
not help thinking that if either of them had
cause to be jealous he was the party.</p>
<p><pp>And here, we may be permitted to offer an
observation upon the peculiar and unaccountable
influence which ladies of a shrewish turn
so frequently exercise over&mdash;we can scarcely,
in this case, say&mdash;their lords and masters; an
influence which seems not merely to extend to
the will of the husband, but even to his inclinations.
We do not remember to have met
with a single individual, reported to be under
petticoat government, who was not content with
his lot,&mdash;nay, who so far from repining, did
not exult in his servitude; and we see no way
of accounting for this apparently inexplicable
conduct&mdash;for which, among other phenomena
of married life, various reasons have been
assigned, though none entirely satisfactory to</pp>
<pb n="178">
<pp>us&mdash;except upon the ground that these domineering
dames possess some charm sufficiently
strong to counteract the irritating effect of
their tempers; some secret and attractive quality
of which the world at large is in ignorance,
and with which their husbands alone can be
supposed to be acquainted. An influence of
this description appeared to be exerted on the
present occasion. The worthy carpenter was
restored to instant good humour by a glance
from his helpmate; and, notwithstanding the
infliction he had just endured, he would have
quarrelled with any one who had endeavoured
to persuade him that he was not the happiest
of men, and Mrs. Wood the best of wives.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Women must have their wills while they
live, since they can make none when they die,&rdquo; 
observed Wood, as he imprinted a kiss of
reconciliation on the plump hand of his consort; 
&mdash;a sentiment to the correctness of which
the party chiefly interested graciously vouchsafed
her assent.</p>
<p><pp>Lest the carpenter should be taxed with too
much uxoriousness, it behoves us to ascertain</pp>
<pb n="179">
<pp>whether the personal attractions of his helpmate
would, in any degree, justify the devotion
he displayed. In the first place, Mrs.
Wood had the advantage of her husband in
point of years, being on the sunny side of
forty,&mdash;a period pronounced by competent
judges to be the most fascinating, and, at the
same time, most critical epoch of woman's
existence,&mdash;whereas, he was on the shady side
of fifty,&mdash;a term of life not generally conceived
to have any special recommendation in
female eyes. In the next place, she really
had some pretensions to beauty. Accounted
extremely pretty in her youth, her features
and person expanded as she grew older, without
much detriment to their original comeliness.
Hers was beauty on a large scale no
doubt; but it was beauty, nevertheless: and
the carpenter thought her eyes as bright, her
complexion as blooming, and her figure (if a
little more buxom) quite as captivating as
when he led her to the altar some twenty
years ago.</pp></p>
<p><pp>On the present occasion, in anticipation of</pp>
<pb n="180">
<pp>Mr. Kneebone's visit, Mrs. Wood was dressed
with more than ordinary care, and in more
than ordinary finery. A dove&hyphen;coloured kincob
gown, embroidered with large trees, and made
very low in front, displayed to the greatest
possible advantage, the rounded proportions
of her figure; while a high&hyphen;heeled, red&hyphen;leather
shoe did not detract from the symmetry
of a very neat ankle, and a very small foot.
A stomacher, fastened by imitation&hyphen;diamond
buckles, girded that part of her person, which
should have been a waist; a coral necklace
encircled her throat, and a few black patches,
or mouches, as they were termed, served as
a foil to the bloom of her cheek and chin.
Upon a table, where they had been hastily
deposited, on the intelligence of Darrell's accident,
lay a pair of pink kid gloves, bordered
with lace, and an enormous fan; the latter,
when opened, represented the metamorphosis
and death of Act&aelig;on. From her stomacher,
to which it was attached by a multitude of
glittering steel chains, depended an immense
turnip&hyphen;shaped watch, in a pinchbeck case.</pp>
<pb n="181">
<pp>Her hair was gathered up behind, in a sort
of pad, according to the then&hyphen;prevailing mode; 
and she wore a muslin cap, and pinners, with
crow&hyphen;foot edging. A black silk furbelowed
scarf covered her shoulders; and over the
kincob gown hung a yellow satin apron, trimmed
with white Persian.</pp></p>
<p>But, in spite of her attractions, we shall
address ourselves to the younger, and more
interesting couple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could almost find in my heart to quarrel
with Jack Sheppard for occasioning you so
much pain,&rdquo; observed little Winifred Wood,
as, having completed her ministration to the
best of her ability, she helped Thames on
with his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think you could find in your heart
to quarrel with any one, Winny; much less
with a person whom I like so much as Jack
Sheppard. My arm's nearly well again. And
I've already told you the accident was not
Jack's fault. So, let's think no more about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It's strange you should like Jack so much</pp>
<pb n="182">
<pp>dear Thames. He doesn't resemble you at
all.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;The very reason why I like him, Winny.
If he <it>did</it> resemble me, I shouldn't care about
him. And, whatever you may think, I assure
you, Jack's a downright good&hyphen;natured
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goodnatured fellows are always especial favourites
with boys. And, in applying the
term to his friend, Thames meant to pay him
a high compliment. And so Winifred understood
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, in reply, &ldquo;I may have
done Jack an injustice. I'll try to think better
of him in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, if you want an additional inducement
to do so, I can tell you there's no one&mdash; 
not even his mother&mdash;whom he loves so well
as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loves!&rdquo; echoed Winifred, slightly colouring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, loves, Winny. Poor fellow! he sometimes
indulges the hope of marrying you, when
he grows old enough.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="183">
<p>&ldquo;Thames!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I said anything to offend you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no. But if you wouldn't have me
positively dislike Jack Sheppard, you'll never
mention such a subject again. Besides,&rdquo; she
added, blushing yet more deeply, &ldquo;it isn't a
proper one to talk upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, to change it,&rdquo; replied Thames,
gravely, &ldquo;suppose I should be obliged to leave
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winifred looked as if she could not indulge
such a supposition for a single moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she said, after a pause, &ldquo;you
don't attach any importance to what my mother
has just said. <it>She</it> has already forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <it>I</it> never can forget it, Winny. I will
no longer be a burthen to those upon whom I
have no claim, but compassion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, in a low and mournful, but
firm voice, the tears gathered thickly in Winifred's
dark eyelashes.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;If you are in earnest, Thames,&rdquo; she replied,
with a look of gentle reproach, &ldquo;you are very
foolish; and, if in jest, very cruel. My mother,</pp>
<pb n="184">
<pp>I'm sure, didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
She loves you too well for that. And I'll answer
for it, she'll never say a syllable to annoy
you again.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Thames tried to answer her, but his voice
failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! I see the storm has blown over,&rdquo; 
cried Winifred, brightening up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're mistaken, Winny. Nothing can
alter my determination. I shall quit this roof
to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl's countenance fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do nothing without consulting my father&mdash; 
<it>your</it> father, Thames,&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;Promise
me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly. And what's more, I promise
to abide by his decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I'm quite easy,&rdquo; cried Winifred,
joyfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure he won't attempt to prevent me,&rdquo; 
rejoined Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slight smile that played upon Winifred's
lips seemed to say that <it>she</it> was not quite
so sure. But she made no answer.</p>
<pb n="185">
<p>&ldquo;In case he should consent&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;He never will,&rdquo; interrupted Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case he <it>should</it>, I say,&rdquo; continued
Thames, &ldquo;will <it>you</it> promise to let Jack Sheppard
take my place in your affections, Winny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied the little damsel. &ldquo;I can
never love any one so much as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excepting your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winifred was going to say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but she
checked herself; and, with cheeks mantling
with blushes, murmured, &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't
teaze me about Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing conversation, having been conducted
throughout in a low tone, and apart,
had not reached the ears of Mr. and Mrs.
Wood, who were, furthermore, engaged in a
little conjugal <it>t&ecirc;te&hyphen;&agrave;&hyphen;t&ecirc;te</it> of their own. The last
observation, however, caught the attention of
the carpenter's wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that you're saying about Jack
Sheppard?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Thames was just observing&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Thames!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Wood, glancing
angrily at her husband. &ldquo;There's another instance</pp>
<pb n="186">
<pp>of your wilfulness and want of taste.
Who but <it>you</it> would have dreamed of giving
the boy such a name? Why, it's the name of
a river, not a Christian. No gentleman was
ever called Thames, and Darrell <it>is</it> a gentleman,
unless the whole story of his being found in the
river is a fabrication!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you forget&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;No, Mr. Wood, I forget nothing. I've an
excellent memory, thank God! And I perfectly
remember that everybody was drowned
upon that occasion&mdash;except yourself and the
child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love, you're beside yourself&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;I <it>was</it> beside myself to take charge of
your&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; interposed Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's of no use,&rdquo; observed Thames quietly,
but with a look that chilled the little damsel's
heart;&mdash;&ldquo;my resolution is taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You at least appear to forget that Mr.
Kneebone is coming, my dear,&rdquo; ventured Mr.
Wood.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Good gracious! so I do,&rdquo; exclaimed his</pp>
<pb n="187">
<pp>amiable consort. &ldquo;But you <it>do</it> agitate me so
much. Come into the parlour, Winifred, and
dry your eyes directly, or I'll send you to bed.
Mr. Wood, I desire you'll put on your best
things, and join us as soon as possible. Thames,
you needn't tidy yourself, as you've hurt your
arm. Mr. Kneebone will excuse you. Dear
me! if there isn't his knock. Oh! I'm in such
a fluster!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Upon which, she snatched up her fan, cast a
look into the glass, smoothed down her scarf,
threw a soft expression into her features, and
led the way into the next room, whither she
was followed by her daughter and Thames
Darrell.</p></div4>

<subhead>THE JACOBITE.</subhead> <attbytes>8Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030628</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard. A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><smallcap>Mr. William Kneebone</smallcap> was a woollen&hyphen;draper
of &ldquo;credit and renown,&rdquo; whose place of
business was held at the sign of the Angel (for,
in those days, every shop had its sign), opposite
Saint Clement's church in the Strand. A
native of Manchester, he was the son of Kenelm
Kneebone, a staunch catholic, and a sergeant
of dragoons, who lost his legs and his life while
fighting for James the Second at the battle of
the Boyne, and who had little to bequeath his
son except his laurels and his loyalty to the
house of Stuart.</p>
<p><pp>The gallant woolen&hyphen;draper was now in his
thirty&hyphen;sixth year. He had a handsome, jolly&hyphen;looking
face; stood six feet two in his stockings; 
and measured more than a cloth&hyphen;yard</pp>
<pb n="189">
<pp>shaft across the shoulders&mdash;athletic proportions
derived from his father the dragoon. And, if
it had not been for a taste for plotting, which
was continually getting him into scrapes, he
might have been accounted a respectable member
of society.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Of late, however, his plotting had assumed a
more dark and dangerous complexion. The
times were such that, with the opinions he entertained,
he could not remain idle. The spirit
of disaffection was busy throughout the kingdom.
It was on the eve of that memorable rebellion
which broke forth, two months later, in
Scotland. Since the accession of George the
First to the throne in the preceding year, every
effort had been made by the partisans of the
Stuarts to shake the credit of the existing government,
and to gain supporters to their cause.
Disappointed in their hopes of the restoration
of the fallen dynasty after the death of Anne,
the adherents of the Chevalier de Saint George
endeavoured, by sowing the seeds of dissension
far and wide, to produce a general insurrection
in his favour. No means were neglected to accomplish</pp>
<pb n="190">
<pp>this end. Agents were dispersed in all
directions&mdash;offers the most tempting held out
to induce the wavering to join the Chevalier's
standard. Plots were hatched in the provinces,
where many of the old and wealthy Catholic
families resided, whose zeal for the martyr of
their religion (as the Chevalier was esteemed),
sharpened by the persecutions they themselves
endured, rendered them hearty and efficient allies.
Arms, horses, and accoutrements were
secretly purchased and distributed; and it is
not improbable that, if the unfortunate prince,
in whose behalf these exertions were made, and
who was not deficient in courage, as he proved
at the battle of Malplaquet, had boldly placed
himself at the head of his party at an earlier
period, he might have regained the crown of his
ancestors. But the indecision, which had been
fatal to his race, was fatal to him. He delayed
the blow till the fortunate conjuncture was past.
And when, at length, it <it>was</it> struck, he wanted
energy to pursue his advantages.</pp></p>
<p><pp>But we must not anticipate the course of
events. At the precise period of this history,</pp>
<pb n="191">
<pp>the Jacobite party was full of hope and confidence.
Louis the Fourteenth yet lived, and
expectations were, therefore, indulged of assistance
from France. The disgrace of the
leaders of the late Tory administration had
strengthened, rather than injured, their cause.
Mobs were gathered together on the slightest
possible pretext; and these tumultuous assemblages,
while committing the most outrageous
excesses, loudly proclaimed their hatred to the
house of Hanover, and their determination to
cut off the Protestant succession. The proceedings
of this faction were narrowly watched
by a vigilant and sagacious administration.
The government was not deceived (indeed,
every opportunity was sought by the Jacobites
of parading their numbers,) as to the force of
its enemies; and precautionary measures were
taken to defeat their designs. On the very
day of which we write, namely, the 10th of
June 1715, Bolingbroke and Oxford were impeached
of high treason. The Committee of
Secrecy&mdash;that English Council of Ten&mdash;were
sitting, with Walpole at their head; and the</pp>
<pb n="192">
<pp>most extraordinary discoveries were reported
to be made. On the same day, moreover,
which, by a curious coincidence, was the birthday
of the Chevalier de Saint George, mobs
were collected together in the streets, and the
health of that prince was publicly drunk under
the title of James the Third; while, in many
country towns, the bells were rung, and rejoicings
held, as if for a reigning monarch:&mdash; 
the cry of the populace almost universally
being, &ldquo;No King George, but a Stuart!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>The adherents of the Chevalier de Saint
George, we have said, were lavish in promises
to their proselytes. Posts were offered to all
who chose to accept them. Blank commissions,
signed by the prince, to be filled up by
the name of the person, who could raise a
troop for his service, were liberally bestowed.
Amongst others, Mr. Kneebone, whose interest
was not inconsiderable with the leaders of his
faction, obtained an appointment as captain in
a regiment of infantry, on the conditions above
specified. With a view to raise recruits for
his corps, the warlike woollen&hyphen;draper started</pp>
<pb n="193">
<pp>for Lancashire, under the colour of a journey
on business. He was pretty successful in
Manchester,&mdash;a town which may be said to
have been the head&hyphen;quarters of the disaffected.
On his return to London, he found that applications
had been made from a somewhat doubtful
quarter by two individuals, for the posts of
subordinate officers in his troop. Mr. Kneebone,
or, as he would have preferred being
styled, Captain Kneebone, was not perfectly
satisfied with the recommendations forwarded
by the applicants. But this was not a season
in which to be needlessly scrupulous. He resolved
to judge for himself. Accordingly, he
was introduced to the two military aspirants at
the Cross Shovels in the Mint, by our old acquaintance,
Baptist Kettleby. The Master of
the Mint, with whom the Jacobite captain had
often had transactions before, vouched for their
being men of honour and loyalty; and Kneebone
was so well satisfied with his representations,
that he at once closed the matter by
administering to the applicants the oath of
allegiance and fidelity to King James the</pp>
<pb n="194">
<pp>Third, and several other oaths besides, all of
which those gentlemen took with as little hesitation
as the sum of money, afterwards tendered,
to make the compact binding. The
party, then, sat down to a bowl of punch; 
and, at its conclusion, Captain Kneebone regretted
that an engagement to spend the evening
with Mrs. Wood, would preclude the possibility
of his remaining with his new friends
as long as his inclinations prompted. At this
piece of information, the two subordinate officers
were observed to exchange glances; and,
after a little agreeable raillery on their captain's
gallantry, they begged permission to
accompany him in his visit. Kneebone, who
had drained his glass to the restoration of the
house of Stuart, and the downfall of the house
of Hanover, more frequently than was consistent
with prudence, consented; and the trio
set out for Wych Street, where they arrived in
the jolliest humour possible.</pp></p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Mrs. Wood</smallcap> was scarcely seated before Mr.
Kneebone made his appearance. To her great
surprise and mortification he was not alone; 
but brought with him a couple of friends,
whom he begged to introduce as Mr. Jeremiah
Jackson, and Mr. Solomon Smith, chapmen,
(or what in modern vulgar parlance would be
termed bagmen) travelling to procure orders
for the house of an eminent cloth manufacturer
in Manchester. Neither the manners,
the looks, nor the attire of these gentlemen
prepossessed Mrs. Wood in their favour.
Accordingly, on their presentation, Mr. Jeremiah
Jackson and Mr. Solomon Smith received
something very like a rebuff. Luckily, they</pp>
<pb n="196">
<pp>were not easily discomposed. Two persons
possessing a more comfortable stock of assurance
could not be readily found. Imitating
the example of Mr. Kneebone, who did not
appear in the slightest degree disconcerted by
his cool reception, each sank carelessly into
a chair, and made himself at home in a moment.
Both had very singular faces; very
odd wigs, very much pulled over their brows; 
and very large cravats, very much raised above
their chins. Besides this, each had a large
black patch over his right eye, and a very
queer twist at the left side of his mouth, so
that if their object had been disguise, they
could not have adopted better precautions.
Mrs. Wood thought them both remarkably
plain, but Mr. Smith decidedly the plainest of
the two. His complexion was as blue as a
sailor's jacket, and though Mr. Jackson had
one of the ugliest countenances imaginable, he
had a very fine set of teeth. That was something
in his favour. One peculiarity she did
not fail to notice. They were both dressed in
every respect alike. In fact, Mr. Solomon</pp>
<pb n="197">
<pp>Smith seemed to be Mr. Jeremiah Jackson's
double. He talked in the same style, and
pretty nearly in the same language; laughed
in the same manner, and coughed, or sneezed
at the same time. If Mr. Jackson took an
accurate survey of the room with his one eye,
Mr. Smith's solitary orb followed in the same
direction. When Jeremiah admired the Compasses
in the arms of the Carpenter's Company
over the chimney&hyphen;piece, or the portraits of the
two eminent masters of the rule and plane,
William Portington, and John Scott, Esquires,
on either side of it, Solomon was lost in wonder.
When Mr. Jackson noticed a fine service
of old blue china in an open japan closet, Mr.
Smith had never seen anything like it. And
finally, when Jeremiah, having bestowed upon
Mrs. Wood a very free&hyphen;and&hyphen;easy sort of stare,
winked at Mr. Kneebone, his impertinence was
copied to the letter by Solomon. All three,
then, burst into an immoderate fit of laughter.
Mrs. Wood's astonishment and displeasure
momentarily increased. Such freedoms from
such people were not to be endured. Her</pp>
<pb n="198">
<pp>patience was waning fast. Still, in spite of
her glances and gestures, Mr. Kneebone made
no effort to check the unreasonable merriment
of his companions, but rather seemed to encourage
it. So Mrs. Wood went on fuming,
and the trio went on laughing for some minutes,
nobody knew why or wherefore, until
the party was increased by Mr. Wood, in his
Sunday habiliments and Sunday buckle. Without
stopping to inquire into the cause of their
mirth, or even to ask the names of his guests,
the worthy carpenter shook hands with the
one&hyphen;eyed chapmen, slapped Mr. Kneebone
cordially on the shoulder, and began to laugh
as heartily as any of them.</pp></p>
<p>Mrs. Wood could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you're all bewitched,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are, ma'am, by your charms,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Jackson, gallantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite captivated, ma'am,&rdquo; added Mr.
Smith, placing his hand on his breast.</p>
<p>Mr. Kneebone and Mr. Wood laughed
louder than ever.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Mr. Wood,&rdquo; said the lady, bridling up,</pp>
<pb n="199">
<pp>&ldquo;my request may, perhaps, have some weight
with <it>you</it>. I desire, sir, you'll recollect yourself.
Mr. Kneebone,&rdquo; she added, with a glance
at that gentleman, which was meant to speak
daggers, &ldquo;will do as he pleases.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Here the chapmen set up another boisterous
peal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, I hope, my dear Mrs. W.&rdquo; 
said Mr. Kneebone in a conciliatory tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Smith,
may have rather odd ways with them; but&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;They <it>have</it> very odd ways,&rdquo; interrupted
Mrs. Wood, disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our worthy friend was going to observe,
ma'am, that we never fail in our devotion to
the fair sex,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, ma'am!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Smith, &ldquo;upon
my conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo;said the hospitable carpenter,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say Mr. Kneebone and his friends
would be glad of a little refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;They shall have it, then,&rdquo; replied his better
half, rising. &ldquo;You base ingrate,&rdquo; she
added, in a whisper, as she flounced past Mr.</pp>
<pb n="200">
<pp>Kneebone on her way to the door, &ldquo;how could
you bring such creatures with you, especially
on an occasion like this, when we haven't
met for a fortnight!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn't help it, my life,&rdquo; returned the
gentleman addressed, in the same tone; &ldquo;but
you little know who those individuals are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless us! you alarm me. Who are
they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kneebone assumed a mysterious air; 
and bringing his lips close to Mrs. Wood's ear,
whispered, &ldquo;Secret agents from France&mdash;you
understand&mdash;friends to the good cause&mdash; 
hem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&mdash;persons of rank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kneebone nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noblemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kneebone smiled assent.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Mercy on us! Well, I thought their
manners quite out o' the common. And so,
the invasion really is to take place after all; 
and the Chevalier de Saint George is to land at
the Tower with fifty thousand Frenchmen; 
and the Hanoverian usurper's to be beheaded;</pp>
<pb n="201">
<pp>and Doctor Sacheverel's to be made a bishop,
and we're all to be&wblank;eh?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; returned Kneebone,
putting his finger to his lips; &ldquo;don't let your
imagination run away with you, my charmer.
That boy,&rdquo; he added, looking at Thames,
&ldquo;has his eye upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wood, however, was too much excited
to attend to the caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, lud!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;French noblemen in
disguise! and so rude as I was! I shall never
recover it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good supper will set all to rights,&rdquo; insinuated
Kneebone. &ldquo;But be prudent, my
angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; replied the lady. &ldquo;I'm prudence
personified. You might trust me with
the Chevalier himself,&mdash;I'd never betray him.
But why didn't you let me know they were
coming. I'd have got something nice. As
it is, we've only a couple of ducks&mdash;and they
were intended for you. Winny, my love, come
with me. I shall want you.&mdash;Sorry to quit
your lord&mdash;worships, I mean,&mdash;I don't know</pp>
<pb n="202">
<pp>what I mean,&rdquo; she added, a little confused, and
dropping a profound curtsey to the disguised
noblemen, each of whom replied by a bow,
worthy, in her opinion, of a prince of the
blood at the least,&mdash;&ldquo;but I've a few necessary
orders to give below.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't mind us, ma'am,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson:
&ldquo;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, ma'am,&rdquo; echoed Mr.
Smith: &ldquo;ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How condescending!&rdquo; thought Mrs. Wood.
&ldquo;Not proud in the least, I declare. Well,
I'd no idea,&rdquo; she continued, pursuing her ruminations
as she left the room, &ldquo;that people
of quality laughed so. But it's French manners,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Mrs. Wood's</smallcap> anxiety to please her distinguished
guests speedily displayed itself in a
very plentiful, if not very dainty repast. To
the duckling, peas, and other delicacies, intended
for Mr. Kneebone's special consumption,
she added a few impromptu dishes,
tossed off in her best style; such as lamb
chops, broiled kidneys, fried ham and eggs,
and toasted cheese. Side by side with the
cheese, (its never&hyphen;failing accompaniment, in
all seasons, at the carpenter's board) came a
tankard of swig, and a toast. Besides these
there was a warm gooseberry&hyphen;tart, and a cold
pigeon pie&mdash;the latter capacious enough, even
allowing for its due complement of steak, to</pp>
<pb n="204">
<pp>contain the whole produce of a dovecot; a
couple of lobsters and the best part of a salmon
swimming in a sea of vinegar, and shaded by
a forest of fennel. While the cloth was laid,
the host and Thames descended to the cellar,
whence they returned, laden with a number
of flasks of the same form, and apparently destined
to the same use as those depicted in
Hogarth's delectable print&mdash;the Modern Midnight
Conversation.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Mrs. Wood now re&hyphen;appeared with a very red
face; and, followed by Winifred, took her seat
at the table. Operations then commenced.
Mr. Wood carved the ducks; Mr. Kneebone
helped to the pigeon&hyphen;pie; while Thames unwired
and uncorked a bottle of stout Carnarvonshire
ale. The woollen&hyphen;draper was no despicable
trencherman in a general way; but
his feats with the knife and fork were child's
sport compared with those of Mr. Smith.
The leg and wing of a duck were disposed
of by this gentleman in a twinkling; a brace
of pigeons and a pound of steak followed with
equal celerity; and he had just begun to make</pp>
<pb n="205">
<pp>a fierce assault upon the eggs and ham. His
appetite was perfectly Gargantuan. Nor, must
it be imagined, that while he thus exercised
his teeth, he neglected the flagon. On the
contrary, his glass was never idle, and finding
it not filled quite so frequently as he desired,
he applied himself, notwithstanding the expressive
looks and muttered remonstrances of
Mr. Jackson, to the swig. The latter gentleman
did full justice to the good things before
him; but he drank sparingly, and was visibly
annoyed by his companion's intemperance. As
to Mr. Kneebone, what with flirting with Mrs.
Wood, carving for his friends, and pledging
the carpenter, he had his hands full. At this
juncture, and just as a cuckoo&hyphen;clock in the
corner struck six, Jack Sheppard walked into
the room, with the packing&hyphen;case under his arm.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the right, you see, father,&rdquo; observed
Thames, smiling; &ldquo;Jack <it>has</it> done his
task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I perceive,&rdquo; replied Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I to take it to?&rdquo; asked Sheppard.</p>
<pb n="206">
<p>&ldquo;I told you that before,&rdquo; rejoined Wood,
testily. &ldquo;You must take it to Sir Rowland
Trenchard's in Southampton Fields. And,
mind, it's for his sister, Lady Trafford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wet your whistle before you start, Jack,&rdquo; 
said Kneebone, pouring out a glass of ale.
&ldquo;What's that you're taking to Sir Rowland
Trenchard's?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a box, sir,&rdquo; answered Sheppard,
emptying the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's an odd&hyphen;shaped one,&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone,
examining it attentively. &ldquo;But I can
guess what it's for. Sir Rowland is one of
<it>us</it>,&rdquo; he added, winking at his companions,
&ldquo;and so was his brother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law, Sir Cecil
Trafford. Old Lancashire families both. Strict
Catholics, and loyal to the backbone. Fine
woman, Lady Trafford&mdash;a little on the wane
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you're so very particular,&rdquo; sighed
Mrs. Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; returned Kneebone,
slily; &ldquo;not in the least. Another glass, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="207">
<p>&ldquo;Thank'ee, sir,&rdquo; grinned Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off with it to the health of King James
the Third, and confusion to his enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; interposed Wood; &ldquo;that is treason.
I'll have no such toast drunk at my
table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's the king's birthday,&rdquo; urged the woollen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <it>my</it> king's&rdquo; returned Wood. &ldquo;I
quarrel with no man's political opinions, but
I will have my own respected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh day!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Wood; &ldquo;here's
a pretty&hyphen;to&hyphen;do about nothing. Marry, come
up! I'll see who's to be obeyed. Drink the
toast, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your peril, sirrah!&rdquo; cried Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was hanged that left his drink behind,
you know, master,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard.
&ldquo;Here's King James the Third, and confusion
to his enemies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the carpenter, sitting
down amid the laughter of the company.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; cried Thames, in a loud voice,
&ldquo;you deserve to be hanged for a rebel as you</pp>
<pb n="208">
<pp>are to your lawful king and your lawful master.
But since we must have toasts,&rdquo; he
added, snatching up a glass, &ldquo;listen to mine:
Here's King George the First! a long reign
to him! and confusion to the Popish Pretender
and his adherents!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravely done!&rdquo; said Wood, with tears in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's the kinchin as was to try the dub
for us, ain't it?&rdquo; muttered Smith to his companion
as he stole a glance at Jack Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; returned Jackson, in a deep
whisper; &ldquo;and don't muddle your brains with
any more of that Pharaoh. You'll need all
your strength to grab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; remarked Kneebone,
addressing Sheppard, who, as he caught
the single but piercing eye of Jackson fixed
upon him, started and trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Wood,
in a sharp tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, what's the matter, boy?&rdquo; reiterated
Jackson sternly. &ldquo;Did you never see two
gentlemen with only a couple of peepers between
them before?&rdquo;</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>340Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010109">
<pb n="209">
<p>&ldquo;Never, I'll be sworn!&rdquo; said Smith, taking
the opportunity of filling his glass while
his comrade's back was turned; &ldquo;we're a
nat'ral cur'osity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have a word with you, master?&rdquo; 
said Sheppard, approaching Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a syllable!&rdquo; answered the carpenter,
angrily. &ldquo;Get about your business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames!&rdquo; cried Jack, beckoning to his
friend.</p>
<p>But Darrell averted his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress!&rdquo; said the apprentice, making a
final appeal to Mrs. Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the room instantly, sirrah!&rdquo; rejoined
the lady, bouncing up, and giving him a
slap on the cheek that made his eyes flash fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I be cursed,&rdquo; muttered Sheppard,
as he slunk away with (as the woollen&hyphen;draper
pleasantly observed) &lsquo;a couple of boxes in
charge,&rsquo; &ldquo;if ever I try to be honest again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a little toasted cheese with the swig,
Mr. Smith,&rdquo; observed Wood. &ldquo;That's an incorrigible
rascal,&rdquo; he added, as Sheppard closed
the door; &ldquo;it's only to&hyphen;day that I discovered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="210">
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Jackson, pricking up his
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't speak ill of him behind his back,
father,&rdquo; interposed Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <it>I</it> were your father, young gentleman,&rdquo; 
returned Jackson, enraged at the interruption,
&ldquo;I'd teach <it>you</it> not to speak till you were
spoken to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thames was about to reply, but a glance
from Wood checked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rebuke is just,&rdquo; said the carpenter; 
&ldquo;at the same time, I'm not sorry to find
you're a friend to fair play, which, as you
seem to know, is a jewel. Open that bottle
with a blue seal, my dear. Gentlemen! a glass
of brandy will be no bad finish to our meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposal giving general satisfaction,
the bottle circulated swiftly; and Smith found
the liquor so much to his taste, that he made it
pay double toll on its passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son is a lad of spirit, Mr. Wood,&rdquo; 
observed Jackson, in a slightly&hyphen;sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's not my son,&rdquo; rejoined the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="211">
<p>&ldquo;Except by adoption. Thames Darrell
is&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;My husband nicknames him Thames,&rdquo; interrupted
Mrs. Wood, &ldquo;because he found him
in the river!&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; echoed Smith, taking another
bumper of brandy; &ldquo;he'll set the Thames on
fire one of these days, I'll warrant him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's more than you'll ever do, you
drunken fool!&rdquo; growled Jackson, in an under
tone: &ldquo;be cautious, or you'll spoil all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we send for a bowl of punch,&rdquo; 
said Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo; replied Wood. And,
turning to his daughter, he gave the necessary
directions in a low tone.</p>
<p><pp>Winifred, accordingly, left the room, and a
servant being despatched to the nearest tavern,
soon afterwards returned with a crown bowl of
the ambrosian fluid. The tables were then
cleared. Bottles and glasses usurped the place
of dishes and plates. Pipes were lighted; and
Mr. Kneebone began to dispense the fragrant
fluid; begging Mrs. Wood, in a whisper, as</pp>
<pb n="212">
<pp>he filled a rummer to the brim, not to forget
the health of the Chevalier de Saint George&mdash; 
a proposition to which the lady immediately
responded by drinking the toast aloud.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chevalier shall hear of this,&rdquo; whispered
the woollen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't say so!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Wood,
delighted at the idea.</p>
<p>Mr. Kneebone assured her that he <it>did</it> say
so; and, as a further proof of his sincerity,
squeezed her hand very warmly under the table.</p>
<p><pp>Mr. Smith, now, being more than half&hyphen;seas
over, became very uproarious, and, claiming
the attention of the table, volunteered the following
<caption>DRINKING SONG.</caption>
<caption>I.</caption>
<lb><lg><l>Jolly nose! the bright rubies that garnish thy tip</l>
<l>Are dug from the mines of canary;</l>
<l>And to keep up their lustre I moisten my lip</l>
<l>With hogsheads of claret and sherry.</l></lg>
<lb><caption>II.</caption>
<lg><l>Jolly nose! he who sees thee across a broad glas</l>
<l>Beholds thee in all thy perfection;</l>
<l>And to the pale snout of a temperate ass</l>
<l>Entertains the profoundest objection.</l></lg></pp>
<pb n="213">
<pp><caption>III.</caption>
<lb><lg><l>For a big&hyphen;bellied glass is the palette I use,</l>
<l>And the choicest of wine is my colour;</l>
<l>And I find that my nose takes the mellowest hues</l>
<l>The fuller I fill it&mdash;the fuller!</l></lg>
<lb><caption>IV.</caption>
<lb><lg><l>Jolly nose! there are fools who say drink hurts the sight;</l>
<l>Such dullards know nothing about it.</l>
<l>'Tis better, with wine, to extinguish the light,</l>
<l>Than live always, in darkness, without it!</l></lg></pp></p>
<lb><p>&ldquo;How long may it be since that boy was
found in the way Mrs. Wood mentions?&rdquo; inquired
Jackson, as soon as the clatter that
succeeded Mr. Smith's melody had subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; replied Wood; &ldquo;exactly
twelve years ago last November.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that must be about the time of the
Great Storm,&rdquo; rejoined Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; exclaimed Wood, &ldquo;you've hit
the right nail on the head, anyhow. It <it>was</it>
on the night of the Great Storm that I found
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I should like to hear all particulars of the</pp>
<pb n="214">
<pp>affair,&rdquo; said Jackson, &ldquo;if it wouldn't be troubling
you too much.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood required little pressing. He took
a sip of punch and commenced his relation.
Though meant to produce a totally different
effect, the narrative seemed to excite the risible
propensities rather than the commiseration of
his auditor; and when Mr. Wood wound it up
by a description of the drenching he had undergone
at the Mint pump, the other could
hold out no longer, but, leaning back in his
chair, gave free scope to his merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;but
really&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;you must excuse me!&mdash;that
is so uncommonly diverting&mdash;ha! ha! Do let
me hear it again?&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; rejoined Wood, &ldquo;you
seem vastly entertained by my misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure! Nothing entertains me so
much. People always rejoice at the misfortunes
of others&mdash;never at their own! The
droll dogs! how <it>they</it> must have enjoyed it!&mdash; 
ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I dare say they did. But <it>I</it> found it no</pp>
<pb n="215">
<pp>laughing matter, I can assure you. And,
though it's a long time ago, I feel as sore on
the subject as ever.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite natural! Never forgive an injury!
&mdash;<it>I</it> never do!&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr. Jackson, I could almost fancy
we had met before. Your laugh reminds me
of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Whose, sir?&rdquo; demanded Jackson, becoming
suddenly grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll not be offended, I hope,&rdquo; returned
Wood, drily, &ldquo;if I say that your voice, your
manner, and, above all, your very extraordinary
way of laughing, put me strangely in
mind of one of the &lsquo;droll dogs,&rsquo; (as you term
them,) who helped to perpetrate the outrage
I've just described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I allude to an individual, who has since
acquired an infamous notoriety as a thieftaker; 
but who, in those days, was himself
the associate of thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="216">
<p>&ldquo;'Sblood!&rdquo; cried Jackson, rising, &ldquo;I can't
sit still and hear Mr. Wild, whom I believe to
be as honest a gentleman as any in the kingdom,
calumniated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire and fury!&rdquo; exclaimed Smith, getting
up with the brandy&hyphen;bottle in his grasp; &ldquo;no
man shall abuse Mr. Wild in my presence!
He's the right&hyphen;hand of the community! We
could do nothing without him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>We</it>!&rdquo; repeated Wood, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every honest man, sir! He helps us to
our own again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; observed Thames, laughing, &ldquo;to
one who entertains so high an opinion of
Jonathan Wild, as Mr. Jackson appears to do,
it can't be very offensive to be told, that he's
like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I don't object to the likeness, if any such
exists, young sir,&rdquo; returned Jackson, darting
an angry glance at Thames; &ldquo;indeed I'm
rather flattered by being thought to resemble
a gentleman of Mr. Wild's figure. But I
can't submit to hear the well&hyphen;earned reputation</pp>
<pb n="217">
<pp>of my friend termed an &lsquo;infamous notoriety.&rdquo;&rsquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can't stand that,&rdquo; hiccupped Smith,
scarcely able to keep his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; rejoined Wood, mildly; 
since Mr. Wild is a friend of yours, I'm sorry
for what I said. I've no doubt he's as honest
as either of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; returned Jackson, extending his
hand; &ldquo;and if I've expressed myself warmly,
I'm sorry for it likewise. But you must allow
me to observe, my good sir, that you're wholly
in the wrong respecting my friend. Mr. Wild
never was the associate of thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; echoed Smith, emphatically, &ldquo;upon
my honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm satisfied with your assurance,&rdquo; replied
the carpenter, drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's more than I am,&rdquo; muttered Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not aware that Jonathan Wild was
an acquaintance of yours, Mr. Jackson,&rdquo; said
Kneebone, whose assiduity to Mrs. Wood had
prevented him from paying much attention to
the previous scene.</p>
<pb n="218">
<p>&ldquo;I've known him all my life,&rdquo; replied the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil you have! Then, perhaps, you
can tell me when he intends to put his threat
into execution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What threat?&rdquo; asked Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of hanging the fellow who acts as
his jackal; one Blake, or Blueskin, I think
he's called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've been misinformed, sir,&rdquo; interposed
Smith. &ldquo;Mr. Wild is incapable of such baseness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; returned the woollen&hyphen;draper. &ldquo;I
see you don't know him as well as you pretend.
Jonathan is capable of anything. He has
hanged twelve of his associates already. The
moment they cease to be serviceable, or become
dangerous, he lodges an information,
and the matter's settled. He has always
plenty of evidence in reserve. Blueskin is
booked. As sure as you're sitting there,
Mr. Smith, he'll swing after next Old Bailey
sessions. I wouldn't be in his skin for a
trifle!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="219">
<p>&ldquo;But he may peach,&rdquo; said Smith, casting
an oblique glance at Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would avail him little if he did,&rdquo; replied
Kneebone. &ldquo;Jonathan does what he pleases
in the courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; chuckled Jackson; &ldquo;very
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blueskin's only chance would be to carry
<it>his</it> threat into effect,&rdquo; pursued the woolen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; exclaimed Jackson. &ldquo;<it>He</it> threatens,
does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; replied Kneebone; &ldquo;I
understand he drew a knife upon Jonathan, in
a quarrel between them lately. And, since
then, he has openly avowed his determination
of cutting his master's throat on the slightest
inkling of treachery. But, perhaps Mr. Smith
will tell you I'm misinformed, also, on that
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; rejoined Smith, looking
askance at his companion, &ldquo;I happen to <it>know</it>
you're in the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, sir, I'm obliged to you,&rdquo; said Jackson;</pp>
<pb n="220">
<pp>&ldquo;I shall take care to put Mr. Wild on
his guard against an assassin.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall put Blueskin on the alert
against the designs of a traitor,&rdquo; rejoined
Smith, in a tone that sounded like a menace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; remarked Kneebone, &ldquo;it
doesn't matter how soon society is rid of two
such scoundrels; and if Blueskin dies by the
rope, and Jonathan by the hand of violence,
they'll meet the fate they merit. Wild was
formerly an agent to the Jacobite party, but,
on the offer of a bribe from the opposite
faction, he unhesitatingly deserted and betrayed
his old employers. Of late, he has become the
instrument of Walpole, and does all the dirty
work for the Secret Committee. Several arrests
of importance have been intrusted to him; 
but, forewarned, forearmed, we have constantly
baffled his schemes;&mdash;ha! ha! Jonathan's a
devilish clever fellow. But he can't have his
eyes always about him, or he'd have been with
us this morning at the Mint, eh, Mr. Jackson!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="221">
<p>&ldquo;So he would,&rdquo; replied the latter; &ldquo;so he
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all his cunning, he may meet with
his match,&rdquo; continued Kneebone, laughing.
&ldquo;I've set a trap for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care you don't fall into it yourself,&rdquo; 
returned Jackson, with a slight sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were I in your place,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;I
should be apprehensive of Wild, because he's
a declared enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were I in <it>yours</it>,&rdquo; rejoined the woollen&hyphen; 
draper, &ldquo;I should be doubly apprehensive,
because he's a professed friend. But we're
neglecting the punch all this time. A bumper
round, gentlemen. Success to our enterprise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success to our enterprise!&rdquo; echoed the
others, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask whether you made any further
inquiries into the mysterious affair about which
we were speaking just now?&rdquo; observed Jackson,
turning to the carpenter.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I can't say I did,&rdquo; replied Wood, somewhat
reluctantly; &ldquo;what with the confusion
incident to the storm, and the subsequent press</pp>
<pb n="222">
<pp>of business, I put it off till it was too late.
I've often regretted that I didn't investigate
the matter. However, it doesn't much signify.
All concerned in the dark transaction must
have perished.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that,&rdquo; inquired Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As sure as one reasonably can be. I saw
their boat swept away, and heard the roar of
the fall beneath the bridge; and no one, who
was present, could doubt the result. If the
principal instigator of the crime, whom I afterwards
encountered on the platform, and who
was dashed into the raging flood by the shower
of bricks, escaped, his preservation must have
been indeed miraculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own was equally so,&rdquo; said Jackson
ironically. &ldquo;What if he <it>did</it> escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My utmost efforts should be used to bring
him to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any reason to suppose he survived
the accident?&rdquo; inquired Thames eagerly.</p>
<p>Jackson smiled and put on the air of a man
who knows more than he cares to tell.</p>
<pb n="223">
<p>&ldquo;I merely asked the question,&rdquo; he said,
after he had enjoyed the boy's suspense for a
moment.</p>
<p>The hope that had been suddenly kindled
in the youth's bosom was as suddenly extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought he lived&mdash;&rdquo; observed
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>If</it>,&rdquo; interrupted Jackson, changing his
tone: &ldquo;he <it>does</it> live. And it has been well
for you that he imagines the child was
drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Thames impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're inquisitive, young gentleman,&rdquo; 
replied Jackson, coldly. &ldquo;When you're
older, you'll know that secrets of importance
are not disclosed gratuitously. Your adoptive
father understands mankind better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd give half I'm worth to hang the villain,
and restore this boy to his rights,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wood.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;How do you know he <it>has</it> any rights to be
restored to?&rdquo; returned Jackson, with a grin.
&ldquo;Judging from what you tell me, I've no</pp>
<pb n="224">
<pp>doubt he's the illegitimate offspring of some
handsome, but lowborn profligate; in which
case, he'll neither have name, nor wealth for
his inheritance. The assassination, as you call
it, was, obviously, the vengeance of a kinsman
of the injured lady, who no doubt was of
good family, upon her seducer. The less said,
therefore, on this point the better; because, as
nothing is to be gained by it, it would only be
trouble thrown away. But, if you have any
particular fancy for hanging the gentleman,
who chose to take the law into his own hands
&mdash;and I think your motive extremely disinterested
and praiseworthy&mdash;why, it's just possible,
if you make it worth my while, that your
desires may be gratified.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't see how this is to be effected, unless
you yourself were present at the time,&rdquo; 
said Wood, glancing suspiciously at the
speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no hand in the affair,&rdquo; replied Jackson,
bluntly; &ldquo;but I know those who had; 
and could bring forward evidence, if you require
it.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="225">
<p>&ldquo;The best evidence would be afforded by
an accomplice of the assassin,&rdquo; rejoined Thames,
who was greatly offended by the insinuation as
to his parentage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you could point out such a party,
Mr. Jackson?&rdquo; said Wood, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>I</it> could,&rdquo; replied Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you need no further information from
me,&rdquo; rejoined Jackson, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; cried Wood, &ldquo;this is a most perplexing
business&mdash;if you really are privy to
the affair&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;We'll talk of it to&hyphen;morrow, sir,&rdquo; returned
Jackson, cutting him short. &ldquo;In the mean
time, with your permission, I'll just make a
few minutes of our conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you please,&rdquo; replied Wood,
walking towards the chimney&hyphen;piece, and taking
down a constable's staff, which hung upon a nail.</p>
<p><pp>Jackson, mean time, produced a pocket book; 
and, after deliberately sharpening the
point of a pencil, began to write on a blank
leaf. While he was thus occupied, Thames,
prompted by an unaccountable feeling of</pp>
<pb n="226">
<pp>curiosity, took up the penknife which the
other had just used, and examined the haft.
What he there noticed occasioned a marked
change in his demeanour. He laid down the
knife, and fixed a searching and distrustful
gaze upon the writer, who continued his task,
unconscious of anything having happened.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Jackson, closing the book
and rising, &ldquo;that'll do. To&hyphen;morrow at twelve
I'll be with you, Mr. Wood. Make up your
mind as to the terms, and I'll engage to find
the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; exclaimed the carpenter, in an
authoritative voice: &ldquo;we can't part thus.
Thames, lock the door.&rdquo; (An order which was
promptly obeyed.) &ldquo;Now, sir, I must insist
upon a full explanation of your mysterious
hints, or, as I am headborough of the district,
I shall at once take you into custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson treated this menace with a loud
laugh of derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; he cried, slapping Smith, who
had fallen asleep with the brandy&hyphen;bottle in his
grasp, upon the shoulder. &ldquo;It is time!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="227">
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; grumbled the latter, rubbing
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the caption!&rdquo; replied Jackson, coolly
drawing a brace of pistols from his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; answered Smith, shaking himself,
and producing a similar pair of weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Heaven's name! what's all this?&rdquo; cried
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still, and you'll receive no injury,&rdquo; 
returned Jackson. &ldquo;We're merely about to
discharge our duty by apprehending a rebel.
Captain Kneebone! we must trouble you to
accompany us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've no intention of stirring,&rdquo; replied the
woollen&hyphen;draper, who was thus unceremoniously
disturbed: &ldquo;and I beg you'll sit down, Mr.
Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sir!&rdquo; thundered the latter, &ldquo;no
trifling! Perhaps,&rdquo; he added, opening a warrant,
&ldquo;you'll obey this mandate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warrant!&rdquo; ejaculated Kneebone, starting
to his feet.</p>
<p><pp>&lsquo;Ay, sir, from the Secretary of State, for</pp>
<pb n="228">
<pp><it>your</it> arrest! You're charged with high&hyphen;treason.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;By those who've conspired with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! by those who've entrapped you!
You've long eluded our vigilance; but we've
caught you at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; exclaimed the woollen&hyphen;draper; 
&ldquo;that I should be the dupe of such a
miserable artifice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's no use lamenting now, Captain! You
ought rather to be obliged to us for allowing
you to pay this visit. We could have secured
you when you left the Mint. But we wished
to ascertain whether Mrs. Wood's charms
equalled your description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretches!&rdquo; screamed the lady; &ldquo;don't
dare to breathe your vile insinuations against
me! Oh! Mr. Kneebone, are these your
French noblemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't upbraid me!&rdquo; rejoined the woollen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him along, Joe!&rdquo; said Jackson, in
a whisper to his comrade.</p>
<p><pp>Smith obeyed. But he had scarcely advanced</pp>
<pb n="229">
<pp>a step, when he was felled to the
ground by a blow from the powerful arm of
Kneebone, who, instantly possessing himself
of a pistol, levelled it at Jackson's head.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone! or I fire!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wood,&rdquo; returned Jackson, with the
utmost composure; &ldquo;you're a headborough,
and a loyal subject of King George. I call
upon you to assist me in the apprehension of
this person. You'll be answerable for his
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wood, I command you not to stir,&rdquo; 
vociferated the carpenter's better&hyphen;half; &ldquo;recollect
you'll be answerable to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare I don't know what to do,&rdquo; said
Wood, torn by conflicting emotions. &ldquo;Mr.
Kneebone! you would greatly oblige me by
surrendering yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied the woolen&hyphen;draper; &ldquo;and
if that treacherous rascal, by your side, doesn't
make himself scarce quickly, I'll send a bullet
through his brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My death will lie at your door,&rdquo; remarked
Jackson to the carpenter.</p>
<pb n="230">
<p>&ldquo;Show me your warrant!&rdquo; said Wood, almost
driven to his wit's&hyphen;end; &ldquo;perhaps it isn't
regular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him who he is?&rdquo; suggested Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea!&rdquo; exclaimed the carpenter.
&ldquo;May I beg to know whom I've the pleasure
of addressing? Jackson, I conclude, is merely
an assumed name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it signify?&rdquo; returned the latter,
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal!&rdquo; replied Thames. &ldquo;If you
won't disclose your name, I will for you!
You are Jonathan Wild!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further concealment is needless,&rdquo; answered
the other, pulling off his wig and black
patch, and resuming his natural tone of voice; 
&ldquo;I <it>am</it> Jonathan Wild!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say you so!&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone; &ldquo;then
be this your passport to eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which he drew the trigger of the
pistol, which, luckily for the individual against
whom it was aimed, flashed in the pan.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I might now send you on a similar journey!&rdquo; 
replied Jonathan, with a bitter smile,</pp>
<pb n="231">
<pp>and preserving the unmoved demeanour he
had maintained throughout; &ldquo;but I prefer
conveying you, in the first instance, to Newgate.
The Jacobite daws want a scarecrow.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>So saying, he sprang, with a bound like that
of a tiger&hyphen;cat, against the throat of the woollen&hyphen;draper.
And so sudden and well&hyphen;directed
was the assault, that he completely overthrew
his gigantic antagonist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend a hand with the ruffles, Blueskin!&rdquo; 
he shouted, as that personage, who had just
recovered from the stunning effects of the
blow, contrived to pick himself up. &ldquo;Look
quick, d&wblank;&hyphen;n you, or we shall never master
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Wood, at the top
of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's a pistol!&rdquo; cried Thames, darting
towards the undischarged weapon dropped by
Blueskin in the scuffle, and pointing it at Jonathan.
&ldquo;Shall I shoot him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! put it to his ear!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Wood; &ldquo;that's the surest way!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No! no! give it me!&rdquo; vociferated Wood,</pp>
<pb n="232">
<pp>snatching the pistol, and rushing to the door,
against which he placed his back.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll soon settle this business. Jonathan
Wild!&rdquo; he added, in a loud voice, &ldquo;I command
you to release your prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, who, with
Blueskin's aid, had succeeded in slipping a
pair of handcuffs over the woolen&hyphen;draper's
wrists, &ldquo;when I've Mr. Walpole's order to
that effect&mdash;but not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll take the consequences, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I arrest you, and your confederate,
Joseph Blake, alias Blueskin, on a
charge of felony,&rdquo; returned Wood, brandishing
his staff; &ldquo;resist my authority, if you dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clever device,&rdquo; replied Jonathan; &ldquo;but
it won't serve your turn. Let us pass, sir.
Strike the gag, Blueskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not stir a footstep. Open the
window, Thames, and call for assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Jonathan, who did not care to
push matters too far, &ldquo;let me have a word
with you, Mr. Wood.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="233">
<p>&ldquo;I'll have no explanations whatever,&rdquo; replied
the carpenter, disdainfully, &ldquo;except before
a magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least state your charge. It is a serious
accusation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <it>is</it>,&rdquo; answered Wood. &ldquo;Do you recollect
this key? Do you recollect to whom you
gave it, and for what purpose? or shall I refresh
your memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild appeared confounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release your prisoner,&rdquo; continued Wood,
&ldquo;or the window is opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wood,&rdquo; said Jonathan, advancing towards
him, and speaking in a low tone, &ldquo;the
secret of your adopted son's birth is known to
me. The name of his father's murderer is also
known to me. I can help you to both,&mdash;nay,
I <it>will</it> help you to both, if you do not interfere
with my plans. The arrest of this person is of
consequence to me. Do not oppose it, and I
will serve you. Thwart me, and I become
your mortal enemy. I have but to give a hint
of that boy's existence in the proper quarter,
and his life will not be worth a day's purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="234">
<p>&ldquo;Don't listen to him, father,&rdquo; cried Thames,
unconscious of what was passing; &ldquo;there are
plenty of people outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your choice,&rdquo; said Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don't decide quickly, I'll scream,&rdquo; 
cried Mrs. Wood, popping her head through
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set your prisoner free!&rdquo; returned Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off the ruffles, Blueskin,&rdquo; rejoined
Wild. &ldquo;You know my fixed determination,&rdquo; 
he added in a low tone, as he passed the carpenter.
&ldquo;Before to&hyphen;morrow night that boy
shall join his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he unlocked the door, and strode
out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are some letters, which will let you
see what a snake you've cherished in your
bosom, you uxorious old dotard,&rdquo; said Blueskin,
tossing a packet of papers to Wood, as he
followed his leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Odd's&hyphen;my&hyphen;life! what's this?&rdquo; exclaimed
the carpenter, looking at the superscription of
one of them. &ldquo;Why, this is your writing,
Dolly, and addressed to Mr. Kneebone.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="235">
<p>&ldquo;My writing! no such thing!&rdquo; ejaculated
the lady, casting a look of alarm at the woollen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confusion! the rascal must have picked
my pocket of your letters,&rdquo; whispered Kneebone.
&ldquo;What's to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's to be done! Why, I'm undone!
How imprudent in you not to burn them. But
men <it>are</it> so careless, there's no trusting anything
to them! However, I must try to brazen
it out.&mdash;Give me the letters, my love,&rdquo; she
added aloud, and in her most winning accents; 
&ldquo;they're some wicked forgeries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, madam,&rdquo; replied the carpenter,
turning his back upon her, and sinking
into a chair: &ldquo;Thames, my love, bring me my
spectacles. My heart misgives me. Fool that
I was to marry for beauty! I ought to have
remembered that a fair woman and a slashed
gown always find some nail in the way.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>If</smallcap> there is one thing on earth, more lovely
than another, it is a fair girl of the tender age
of Winifred Wood! Her beauty awakens no
feeling beyond that of admiration. The charm
of innocence breathes around her, as fragrance
is diffused by the flower, sanctifying her lightest
thought and action, and shielding her, like
a spell, from the approach of evil. Beautiful
is the girl of twelve,&mdash;who is neither child nor
woman, but something between both, something
more exquisite than either!</p>
<p>Such was the fairy creature presented to
Thames Darrell, under the following circumstances.</p>
<p><pp>Glad to escape from the scene of recrimination
that ensued between his adopted parents,</pp>
<pb n="237">
<pp>Thames seized the earliest opportunity of retiring,
and took his way to a small chamber in
the upper part of the house, where he and Jack
were accustomed to spend most of their leisure
in the amusements, or pursuits, proper to their
years. He found the door ajar, and, to his
surprise, perceived little Winifred seated at a
table, busily engaged in tracing some design
upon a sheet of paper. She did not hear his
approach, but continued her occupation without
raising her head.</pp></p>
<p><pp>It was a charming sight to watch the motions
of her tiny fingers as she pursued her task; 
and though the posture she adopted was not
the most favourable that might have been chosen
for the display of her sylphlike figure, there
was something in her attitude, and the glow of
her countenance, lighted up by the mellow radiance
of the setting sun falling upon her
through the panes of the little dormar window,
that seemed to the youth inexpressibly
beautiful. Winifred's features would have been
pretty, for they were regular and delicately
formed, if they had not been slightly marked.</pp>
<pb n="238">
<pp>by the small&hyphen;pox;&mdash;a disorder, that sometimes
spares more than it destroys, and imparts an
expression to be sought for in vain in the
smoothest complexion. We have seen pitted
cheeks, which we would not exchange for dimples
and a satin skin. Winifred's face had a
thoroughly amiable look. Her mouth was worthy
of her face; with small, pearly&hyphen;white teeth; 
lips glossy, rosy, and pouting; and the sweetest
smile imaginable, playing constantly about
them. Her eyes were soft and blue, arched
over by dark brows, and fringed by long silken
lashes. Her hair was of the darkest brown,
and finest texture; and, when unloosed, hung
down to her heels. She was dressed in a little
white frock, with a very long body, and very
short sleeves, which looked (from a certain fullness
about the hips,) as if it was intended to be
worn with a hoop. Her slender throat was encircled
by a black riband, with a small locket
attached to it; and upon the top of her head
rested a diminutive lace cap.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The room in which she sat was a portion of
the garret, assigned, as we have just stated, by</pp>
<pb n="239">
<pp>Mr. Wood as a playroom to the two boys; 
and, like most boy's playrooms, it exhibited a
total absence of order, or neatness. Things
were thrown here and there, to be taken up, or
again cast aside, as the whim arose; while the
broken&hyphen;backed chairs and crazy table bore the
marks of many a conflict. The characters of
the youthful occupants of the room might be
detected in every article it contained. Darrell's
peculiar bent of mind was exemplified in a
rusty broadsword, a tall grenadier's cap, a
musket without lock or ramrod, a belt and
cartouch&hyphen;box, with other matters, evincing a
decided military taste. Among his books, Plutarch's
Lives, and the Histories of Great Commanders,
appeared to have been frequently consulted; 
but the dust had gathered thickly upon
the Carpenter's Manual, and a Treatise on Trigonometry
and Geometry. Beneath the shelf,
containing these books, hung the fine old ballad
of &lsquo;<it>St. George for England</it>,&rsquo;and a loyal
ditty, then much in vogue, called &lsquo;<it>True Protestant
Gratitude, or Britain's Thanksgiving
for the First of August, Being the Day of His</it></pp>
<pb n="240">
<pp><it>Majesty's Happy Accession to the Throne.</it>&rsquo; 
Jack Sheppard's library consisted of a few ragged
and well&hyphen;thumbed volumes abstracted from
the tremendous chronicles bequeathed to the
world by those Froissarts and Holinsheds of
crime&mdash;the Ordinaries of Newgate. His vocal
collection comprised a couple of flash songs
pasted against the wall, entitled &lsquo;<it>The Thief&hyphen;Catcher's
Prophecy</it>,&rsquo;and the &lsquo;<it>Life and Death
of the Darkman's Budge</it>;&rsquo;while his extraordinary
mechanical skill was displayed in what he
termed (Jack had a supreme contempt for orthography,)
a &lsquo;<it>Moddle of his Ma<sup>s</sup>. Jale off
Newgate</it>;&rsquo;another model of the pillory at
Fleet Bridge; and a third of the permanent
gibbet at Tyburn. The latter specimen of his
workmanship was adorned with a little scarecrow
figure, intended to represent a housebreaking
chimney&hyphen;sweeper of the time, described
in Sheppard's own hand&hyphen;writing, as
&lsquo;<it>Jack Hall a&hyphen;hanging.</it>&rsquo; We must not omit
to mention that a family group from the
pencil of little Winifred, representing Mr.
and Mrs. Wood in very characteristic attitudes,</pp>
<pb n="241">
<pp>occupied a prominent place on the
walls.</pp></p>
<p>For a few moments, Thames regarded the
little girl through the half&hyphen;opened door in silence.
On a sudden, a change came over her
countenance, which, up to this moment, had
worn a smiling and satisfied expression. Throwing
down the pencil, she snatched up a piece of
Indian&hyphen;rubber, and exclaiming,&mdash;&ldquo;It isn't at
all like him! it isn't half handsome enough!&rdquo; 
was about to efface the sketch, when Thames
darted into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who isn't it like?&rdquo; he asked, endeavouring
to gain possession of the drawing, which, at
the sound of his footstep, she crushed between
her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't tell you!&rdquo; she replied, blushing
deeply, and clinching her little hand as tightly
as possible; &ldquo;it's a secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll soon find it out, then,&rdquo; he returned,
playfully forcing the paper from her
grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't look at it, I entreat,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p><pp>But her request was unheeded. Thames unfolded</pp>
<pb n="242">
<pp>the drawing, smoothed out its creases,
and beheld a portrait of himself.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I've a good mind not to speak to you
again, sir!&rdquo; cried Winifred, with difficulty
repressing a tear of vexation; &ldquo;you've acted
unfairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel I have, dear Winny!&rdquo; replied
Thames, abashed at his own rudeness; &ldquo;my
conduct is inexcusable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll excuse it, nevertheless,&rdquo; returned the
little damsel, affectionately extending her hand
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you afraid to show me this
picture, Winny?&rdquo; asked the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it's not like you,&rdquo; was her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, like or not, I'm greatly pleased
with it, and must beg it from you as a memorial&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; she interrupted, startled by his
change of manner.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Of yourself,&rdquo; he replied, in a mournful
tone. &ldquo;I shall value it highly, and will promise
never to part with it. Winny, this is the</pp>
<pb n="243">
<pp>last night I shall pass beneath your father's
roof.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you told him so?&rdquo; she inquired,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I shall, before he retires to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you <it>will</it> stay!&rdquo; she cried, clapping
her hands joyfully; &ldquo;for I'm sure he won't
part with you. Oh! thank you&mdash;thank you!
I'm so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Winny!&rdquo; he answered, gravely; &ldquo;I
haven't promised yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will,&mdash;won't you?&rdquo; she rejoined,
looking him coaxingly in the face.</p>
<p>Unable to withstand this appeal, Thames
gave the required promise, adding,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!
Winny, I wish Mr. Wood had been my father,
as well as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;for then you would
have been <it>really</it> my brother. No, I don't,
either; because&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Winny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know what I was going to say,&rdquo; 
she added, in some confusion; &ldquo;only I'm
sorry you were born a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="244">
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, I wasn't,&rdquo; returned Thames,
gloomily, as the remembrance of Jonathan
Wild's foul insinuation crossed him. &ldquo;But
never mind who, or what I am. Give me this
picture. I'll keep it for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll give you something better worth keeping,&rdquo; 
she answered, detaching the ornament
from her neck, and presenting it to him; &ldquo;this
contains a lock of my hair, and may remind
you sometimes of your little sister. As to the
picture, I'll keep it myself; though, if you
<it>do</it> go I shall need no memorial of <it>you</it>.
I'd a good many things to say to you, besides
&mdash;but you've put them all out of my
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>With this, she burst into tears, and sank
with her face upon his shoulder. Thames did
not try to cheer her. His own heart was too
full of melancholy foreboding. He felt that
he might soon be separated&mdash;perhaps, for ever
&mdash;from the fond little creature he held in his
arms, whom he had always regarded with the
warmest fraternal affection, and the thought of
how much she would suffer from the separation</pp>
<pb n="245">
<pp>so sensibly affected him, that he could not
help joining in her grief.</pp></p>
<p>From this sorrowful state he was aroused by
a loud derisive whistle, followed by a still
louder laugh; and, looking up, he beheld the
impudent countenance of Jack Sheppard immediately
before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, with a roguish
wink, &ldquo;I've caught you,&mdash;have I?
<lb><lg><l>The carpenter's daughter was fair and free&mdash;</l>
<l>Fair, and fickle, and false, was she!</l>
<l>She slighted the journeyman, (meaning <it>me</it>!)</l>
<l>And smiled on a gallant of high degree.</l>
<l align="r">Degree! degree!</l>
<l>She smiled on a gallant of high degree.</l></lg>
<lb>Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Thames, angrily.</p>
<p>But Sheppard was not to be silenced. He
went on with his song, accompanying it with
the most ridiculous grimaces:
<lb><lg><l>&ldquo;When years were gone by, she began to rue</l>
<l>Her love for the gentleman, (meaning<it>you</it>!)</l>
<l>&lsquo;I slighted the journeyman fond,&rsquo;quoth she,</l>
<l>&lsquo;But where is my gallant of high degree?</l>
<l align="r">&lsquo;Where! where!</l>
<l>&lsquo;Oh! where is my gallant of high degree?&rsquo;</l></lg>
<lb>Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="246">
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; demanded
Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! nothing at all,&rdquo; answered Jack, sneeringly,
&ldquo;though this room's as much mine as
yours, for that matter. But I don't desire to
spoil sport,&mdash;not I. And, if you'll give me
such a smack of your sweet lips, Miss, as
you've just given Thames, I'll take myself
off in less than no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to this request was a &ldquo;smack&rdquo; 
of a very different description, bestowed upon
Sheppard's outstretched face by the little damsel,
as she ran out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Odd's! bodikins!&rdquo; cried Jack, rubbing his
cheek, &ldquo;I'm in luck to&hyphen;day. However, I'd
rather have a blow from the daughter than the
mother. I know who hits hardest. I tell you
what, Thames,&rdquo; he added, flinging himself carelessly
into a chair, &ldquo;I'd give my right hand,
&mdash;and that's no light offer for a carpenter's
&rsquo;prentice,&mdash;if that little minx were half as fond
of me as she is of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's not likely to be the case, if you go
on in this way,&rdquo; replied Thames, sharply.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Why, what the devil would you have had</pp>
<pb n="247">
<pp>me do!&mdash;make myself scarce, eh? You should
have tipped me the wink.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;No more of this,&rdquo; rejoined Thames, &ldquo;or
we shall quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares if we do?&rdquo; retorted Sheppard,
with a look of defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said the other, sternly; &ldquo;don't
provoke me further, or I'll give you a thrashing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two can play at that game, my blood,&rdquo; 
replied Sheppard, rising, and putting himself
into a posture of defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself, then,&rdquo; rejoined
Thames, doubling his fists, and advancing towards
him; &ldquo;though my right arm's stiff, I
can use it, as you'll find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheppard was no match for his opponent, for,
though he possessed more science, he was deficient
in weight and strength; and, after a short
round, in which he had decidedly the worst of
it, a well&hyphen;directed hit on the <it>nob</it> stretched him
at full length on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That'll teach you to keep a civil tongue in
your head for the future,&rdquo; observed Thames, as
he helped Jack to his feet.</p>
<pb n="248">
<p>&ldquo;I didn't mean to give offence,&rdquo; replied
Sheppard, sulkily. &ldquo;But, let me tell you, it's
not a pleasant sight to see the girl one likes in
the arms of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want another drubbing, I perceive,&rdquo; 
said Thames, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don't. Enough's as good as a feast
of the dainties you provide. I'll think no more
about her. Save us!&rdquo; he cried, as his glance
accidentally alighted on the drawing, which
Winifred had dropped in her agitation. &ldquo;Is
this <it>her</it> work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; answered Thames. &ldquo;Do you see
any likeness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't I,&rdquo; returned Jack, bitterly.
&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; he continued, as if talking to himself.
&ldquo;How very like it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so strange, surely,&rdquo; laughed Thames,
&ldquo;that a picture should resemble the person for
whom it's intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but it <it>is</it> strange how much it resembles
somebody for whom it's <it>not</it> intended. It's exactly
like a miniature I have in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miniature! Of whom?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="249">
<p>&ldquo;That I can't say,&rdquo; replied Jack, mysteriously.
&ldquo;But, I half suspect, of your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; exclaimed Thames, in the utmost
astonishment; &ldquo;let me see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; returned Jack, producing a
small picture in a case set with brilliants.</p>
<p>Thames took it, and beheld the portrait of
a young man, apparently&mdash;judging from his attire
&mdash;of high rank, whose proud and patrician
features certainly presented a very striking resemblance
to his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're right Jack,&rdquo; he said, after a pause,
during which he contemplated the picture with
the most fixed attention: &ldquo;this must have been
my father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; answered Sheppard; 
&ldquo;only compare it with Winny's drawing, and
you'll find they're as like as two peas in a pod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; inquired Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Lady Trafford's, where I took the
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, you haven't stolen it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen's an awkward word. But, as you
perceive, I brought it away with me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="250">
<p>&ldquo;It must be restored instantly,&mdash;be the consequences
what they may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're not going to betray me!&rdquo; cried
Jack, in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; replied Thames; &ldquo;but I insist
upon your taking it back at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it back yourself,&rdquo; retorted Jack, sullenly.
&ldquo;I shall do no such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Thames, about to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, planting himself
before the door; &ldquo;do you want to get me sent
across the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to save you from disgrace and ruin,&rdquo; 
returned Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Jack, contemptuously; &ldquo;nobody's
disgraced and ruined unless he's found
out. I'm safe enough if you hold your tongue.
Give me that picture, or I'll make you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me,&rdquo; said Thames, calmly; &ldquo;you
well know you're no match for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at fisticuffs, perhaps,&rdquo; interrupted Jack,
fiercely; &ldquo;but I've my knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You daren't use it.&rdquo;</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>358Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010110">
<pb n="251">
<p>&ldquo;Try to leave the room, and see whether I
daren't,&rdquo; returned Jack, opening the blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't expect this from you,&rdquo; rejoined
Thames, resolutely. &ldquo;But your threats won't
prevent my leaving the room when I please,
and as I please. Now, will you stand aside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't,&rdquo; answered Jack, obstinately.</p>
<p>Thames said not another word, but marched
boldly towards him, and seized him by the
collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave go!&rdquo; cried Jack, struggling violently,
and raising his hand, &ldquo;or I'll maul you for
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Thames was not to be deterred from his
purpose; and the strife might have terminated
seriously, if a peace&hyphen;maker had not appeared
in the shape of little Winifred, who,
alarmed by the noise, rushed suddenly into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she screamed, seeing the uplifted
weapon in Sheppard's hand, &ldquo;don't hurt
Thames&mdash;don't, dear Jack! If you want to
kill somebody, kill me, not him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she flung herself between them.</p>
<pb n="252">
<p>Jack dropped the knife, and walked sullenly
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has caused this quarrel, Thames?&rdquo; 
asked the little girl, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; answered Jack, abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; rejoined Thames. &ldquo;I'll
tell you all about it presently. But you must
leave us now, dear Winny, Jack and I have
something to settle between ourselves. Don't
be afraid. Our quarrel's quite over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; returned Winifred,
looking uneasily at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard; &ldquo;he may do
what he pleases,&mdash;hang me, if he thinks proper,
&mdash;if <it>you</it> wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this assurance, and at the reiterated
request of Thames, the little girl reluctantly
withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Jack,&rdquo; said Thames, walking
up to Sheppard, and taking his hand, &ldquo;have
done with this. I tell you once more, I'll
say and do nothing to get you into trouble.
Rest assured of that. But I'm resolved to
see Lady Trafford. Perhaps, she may tell me
whose picture this is.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="253">
<p>&ldquo;So she may,&rdquo; returned Jack, brightening
up; &ldquo;it's a good idea. I'll go with you.
But you must see her alone; and that'll be
no easy matter to manage, for she's a great
invalid, and has generally somebody with her.
Above all, beware of Sir Rowland Trenchard.
He's as savage and suspicious as the devil
himself. I should never have noticed the miniature
at all, if it hadn't been for him. He
was standing by, rating her ladyship,&mdash;who
can scarcely stir from the sofa,&mdash;while I was
packing up her jewels in the case, and I observed
that she tried to hide a small casket
from him. His back was no sooner turned,
than she slipped this casket into the box.
The next minute, I contrived, without either
of 'em perceiving me, to convey it into my
own pocket. I was sorry for what I did afterwards; 
for, I don't know why, but, poor
lady! with her pale face, and black eyes, she
reminded me of my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, alone, ought to have prevented you
from acting as you did, Jack,&rdquo; returned
Thames, gravely.</p>
<pb n="254">
<p>&ldquo;I should never have acted as I did,&rdquo; rejoined
Sheppard, bitterly; &ldquo;if Mrs. Wood
hadn't struck me. That blow made me a
thief. And, if ever I'm brought to the gallows,
I shall lay my death at her door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, think no more about it,&rdquo; returned
Thames. &ldquo;Do better in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, when I've had my revenge,&rdquo; muttered
Jack. &ldquo;But, take my advice, and keep
out of Sir Rowland's way, or you'll get the
poor lady into trouble as well as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; replied Thames, taking up
his hat. &ldquo;Come, let's be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys, then, emerged upon the landing,
and were about to descend the stairs, when
the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Wood resounded
from below. The storm appeared to have
blown over, for they were conversing in a very
amicable manner with Mr. Kneebone, who was
on the point of departing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sorry, my good friend, there should
have been any misunderstanding between us,&rdquo; 
observed the woollen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Don't mention it,&rdquo; returned Wood, in the</pp>
<pb n="255">
<pp>conciliatory tone of one who admits he has
been in the wrong; &ldquo;your explanation is perfectly
satisfactory.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall expect you to&hyphen;morrow,&rdquo; insinuated
Mrs. Wood; &ldquo;and pray, don't bring
anybody with you,&mdash;especially Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that,&rdquo; laughed Kneebone.&mdash; 
&ldquo;Oh! about that boy, Thames Darrell. His
safety must be looked to. Jonathan's threats
are not to be sneezed at. The rascal will be at
work before the morning. Keep your eye upon
the lad. And mind he doesn't stir out of your
sight, on any pretence whatever, till I call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that,&rdquo; whispered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Thames, in the same tone; 
&ldquo;we haven't a moment to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Wood,
&ldquo;and I'll take care of Thames. It's never a
bad day that has a good ending. Good night!
God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this, there was a great shaking of
hands, with renewed apologies and protestations
of friendship on both sides; after which
Mr. Kneebone took his leave.</p>
<pb n="256">
<p>&ldquo;And so, you really suspected me?&rdquo; murmured
Mrs. Wood, reproachfully, as they returned
to the parlour. &ldquo;Oh! you men!
you men! Once get a thing into your head,
and nothing will beat it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my love,&rdquo; rejoined her husband,
&ldquo;appearances, you must allow, were a little
against you. But, since you assure me <it>you</it>
didn't write the letters, and Mr. Kneebone assures
me <it>he</it> didn't receive them, I can't do
otherwise than believe you. And I've made
up my mind that a husband ought to believe
only half that he hears, and nothing that
he sees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent maxim!&rdquo; replied his wife,
approvingly; &ldquo;the best I ever heard you
utter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must now go and look after Thames,&rdquo; 
observed the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! never mind him: he'll take no harm!
Come with me into the parlour. I can't spare
you at present. Heigho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; cried Jack, as the couple
entered the room: &ldquo;the coast's clear.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="257">
<p>Thames was about to follow, when he felt a
gentle grasp upon his arm. He turned, and
beheld Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be back presently,&rdquo; replied Thames,
evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't go, I beg of you!&rdquo; she implored.
&ldquo;You're in danger. I overheard what Mr.
Kneebone said, just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death and the devil! what a cursed interruption!&rdquo; 
cried Jack, impatiently. &ldquo;If you
loiter in this way, old Wood will catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you stir, I'll call him!&rdquo; rejoined Winifred.
&ldquo;It's you, Jack, who are persuading
my brother to do wrong. Thames,&rdquo; she urged,
&ldquo;the errand, on which you're going, can't be
for any good, or you wouldn't be afraid of
mentioning it to my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's coming!&rdquo; cried Jack, stamping his
foot, with vexation. &ldquo;Another moment, and
it'll be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winny, I <it>must</it> go!&rdquo; said Thames, breaking
from her.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Stay, dear Thames!&mdash;stay!&rdquo; cried the</pp>
<pb n="258">
<pp>little girl. &ldquo;He hears me not! he's gone!&rdquo; 
she added, as the door was opened and shut
with violence; &ldquo;something tells me I shall
never see him again!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>When her father, a moment afterwards,
issued from the parlour to ascertain the cause
of the noise, he found her seated on the stairs,
in an agony of grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where's Thames?&rdquo; he hastily inquired.</p>
<p>Winifred pointed to the door. She could
not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone too,&rdquo; sobbed his daughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Wood uttered something like an imprecation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive me for using such a word!&rdquo; 
he cried, in a troubled tone; &ldquo;if I hadn't
yielded to my wife's silly request, this wouldn't
have happened!&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>On</smallcap> the same evening, in a stately chamber of
a noble old mansion of Elizabeth's time, situated
in Southampton Fields, two persons were
seated. One of these, a lady, evidently a confirmed
invalid, and attired in deep mourning,
reclined upon a sort of couch, or easy chair,
set on wheels, with her head supported by
cushions, and her feet resting upon a velvet
footstool. A crutch, with a silver handle,
stood by her side, proving the state of extreme
debility to which she was reduced. It was no
easy matter to determine her age, for, though
she still retained a certain youthfulness of appearance,
she had many marks in her countenance,
usually indicating the decline of life,
but which in her case were, no doubt, the result</pp>
<pb n="260">
<pp>of constant and severe indisposition. Her
complexion was wan and faded, except where
it was tinged by a slight hectic flush, that made
the want of colour more palpable; her eyes
were large and black, but heavy and lustreless; 
her cheeks sunken; her frame emaciated; 
her dark hair thickly scattered with grey.
When younger, and in better health, she must
have been eminently lovely; and there were
still the remains of great beauty about her.
The expression, however, which would chiefly
have interested a beholder, was that of settled
and profound melancholy.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Her companion was a person of no inferior
condition. Indeed it was apparent, from the
likeness between them, that they were nearly
related. He had the same dark eyes, though
lighted by a fierce flame; the same sallow complexion; 
the same tall, thin figure, and majestic
demeanour; the same proud cast of features.
But here the resemblance stopped. The
expression was wholly different. He looked
melancholy enough, it is true. But his gloom
appeared to be occasioned by remorse, rather</pp>
<pb n="261">
<pp>than sorrow. No sterner head was ever beheld
beneath the cowl of a monk, or the bonnet
of an inquisitor. He seemed inexorable, and
inscrutable as fate itself.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lady Trafford,&rdquo; he said, fixing a
severe look upon her. &ldquo;You depart for Lancashire
to&hyphen;morrow. Have I your final answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; she answered,
in a feeble tone, but firmly. &ldquo;You shall have
the sum you require, but&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not misunderstand me,&rdquo; she proceeded.
&ldquo;I give it to King James&mdash;not to you: for
the furtherance of a great and holy cause,
not for the prosecution of wild and unprofitable
schemes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Rowland bit his lips to repress the
answer that rose to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the will?&rdquo; he said, with forced calmness.
&ldquo;Do you still refuse to make one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>have</it> made one,&rdquo; replied Lady Trafford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried her brother, starting.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Rowland,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;you strive in
vain to terrify me into compliance with your</pp>
<pb n="262">
<pp>wishes. Nothing shall induce me to act contrary
to the dictates of my conscience. My
will is executed, and placed in safe custody.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;In whose favour is it made?&rdquo; he inquired,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In favour of my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no son,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Rowland,
moodily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>had</it> one,&rdquo; answered his sister, in a mournful
voice; &ldquo;and, perhaps, I have one still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought so&wblank;&rdquo; cried the knight,
fiercely; &ldquo;but this is idle,&rdquo; he added, suddenly
checking himself. &ldquo;Aliva, your child
perished with its father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by whom were they both destroyed?&rdquo; 
demanded his sister, raising herself by a painful
effort, and regarding him with a searching
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the avenger of his family's dishonour&mdash; 
by your brother,&rdquo; he replied, coolly.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; cried Lady Trenchard, her eye
blazing with unnatural light, and her cheek
suffused with a crimson stain: &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; she
cried, lifting her thin fingers towards heaven,</pp>
<pb n="263">
<pp>&ldquo;as God shall judge me, I was wedded to that
murdered man!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; ejaculated Sir Rowland, furiously; 
&ldquo;a black, and damning lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the truth,&rdquo; replied his sister, falling
backwards upon the couch. &ldquo;I will swear it
upon the cross!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name, then?&rdquo; demanded the knight.
&ldquo;Tell me that, and I will believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now&mdash;not now!&rdquo; she returned, with a
shudder. &ldquo;When I am dead you will learn it.
Do not disquiet yourself. You will not have
to wait long for the information. Rowland,&rdquo; 
she added, in an altered tone, &ldquo;I am certain
I shall not live many days. And, if you
treat me in this way, you will have my
death to answer for, as well as the deaths of
my husband and child. Let us part in peace.
We shall take an eternal farewell of each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so!&rdquo; rejoined Sir Rowland, with concentrated
fury; &ldquo;but before we <it>do</it> part, I am
resolved to know the name of your pretended
husband!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="264">
<p>&ldquo;Torture shall not wrest it from me,&rdquo; answered
his sister, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What motive have you for concealment?&rdquo; 
he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vow,&rdquo; she answered,&mdash;&ldquo;a vow to my
dead husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Rowland looked at her for a moment, as
if he meditated some terrible reply. He then
arose, and, taking a few turns in the chamber,
stopped suddenly before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has put it into your head that your
son yet lives?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have dreamed that I shall see him before
I die,&rdquo; she rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreamed!&rdquo; echoed the knight, with a
ghastly smile. &ldquo;Is that all? Then learn from
me that your hopes are visionary as their foundation.
Unless he can arise from the bottom
of the Thames, where he and his abhorred father
lie buried, you will never behold him
again in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven have compassion on you, Rowland!&rdquo; 
murmured his sister, crossing her
hands, and looking upwards; &ldquo;you have none
on me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="265">
<p>&ldquo;I <it>will</it> have none till I have forced the
villain's name from you!&rdquo; he cried, stamping
the floor with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rowland, your violence is killing me,&rdquo; she
returned, in a plaintive tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name, I say!&mdash;his name!&rdquo; thundered
the knight.</p>
<p>And he unsheathed his sword.</p>
<p>Lady Trafford uttered a prolonged scream,
and fainted. When she came to herself,
she found that her brother had quitted
the room, leaving her to the care of a female
attendant. Her first orders were to summon
the rest of her servants to make immediate
preparations for her departure for Lancashire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To&hyphen;night, your ladyship?&rdquo; ventured an
elderly domestic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instantly, Hobson,&rdquo; returned Lady Trafford; 
&ldquo;as soon as the carriage can be brought
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be at the door in ten minutes.
Has your ladyship any further commands?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;None whatever. Yet, stay! There is</pp>
<pb n="266">
<pp>one thing I wish you to do. Take that box,
and put it into the carriage yourself. Where
is Sir Rowland?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the library, your ladyship. He has
given orders that no one is to disturb him.
But there's a person in the hall&mdash;a very odd
sort of man&mdash;waiting to see him, who won't
be sent away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Lose not a moment, Hobson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elderly domestic bowed, took up the
case, and retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship is far too unwell to travel,&rdquo; 
remarked the female attendant, assisting her to
rise; &ldquo;you'll never be able to reach Manchester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters not, Norris,&rdquo; replied Lady
Trafford: &ldquo;I would rather die on the road,
than be exposed to another such scene as I
have just encountered.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; sympathised Mrs. Norris. &ldquo;I
was afraid from the scream I heard, that
something dreadful had happened, Sir Rowland
has a terrible temper indeed&mdash;a shocking</pp>
<pb n="267">
<pp>temper! I declare he frightens me out
of my senses.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Rowland is my brother,&rdquo; resumed Lady
Trafford coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that's no reason why he should treat
your ladyship so shamefully, I'm sure. Ah!
how I wish poor dear Sir Cecil were alive!
he'd keep him in order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Trafford sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship has never been well since
you married Sir Cecil,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Norris.
&ldquo;For my part, I don't think you ever quite
got over the accident you met with on the
night of the Great Storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norris!&rdquo; gasped Lady Trafford, trembling
violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! what have I said?&rdquo; cried the
attendant, greatly alarmed by the agitation of
her mistress; &ldquo;do sit down, your ladyship,
while I run for the ratifia and rosa solis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is past,&rdquo; rejoined Lady Trafford, recovering
herself by a powerful effort; &ldquo;but never
allude to the circumstance again. Go and prepare
for our departure.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="268">
<p>In less time than Hobson had mentioned, the
carriage was announced. And Lady Trafford
having been carried down stairs, and placed
within it, the postboys drove off, at a rapid
pace for Barnet.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Sir rowland</smallcap>, meantime, paced his chamber
with a quick and agitated step. He was ill at
ease, though he would not have confessed his
disquietude even to himself. Not conceiving
that his sister&mdash;feeble as she was, and yielding
as she had ever shown herself to his wishes,
whether expressed or implied&mdash;would depart
without consulting him, he was equally surprised
and enraged to hear the servants busied
in transporting her to the carriage. His pride,
however, would not suffer him to interfere with
their proceedings; much less could he bring
himself to acknowledge that he had been in the
wrong, and entreat Lady Trafford to remain,
though he was well aware that her life might
be endangered if she travelled by night. But,</pp>
<pb n="270">
<pp>when the sound of the carriage&hyphen;wheels died
away, and he felt that she was actually gone,
his resolution failed him, and he rang the bell
violently.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;My horses, Charcam,&rdquo; he said, as a servant
appeared.</p>
<p>The man lingered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Sdeath! why am I not obeyed?&rdquo; exclaimed
the knight, angrily. &ldquo;I wish to overtake
Lady Trafford. Use despatch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship will not travel beyond Saint
Alban's to&hyphen;night, Sir Rowland, so Mrs. Norris
informed me,&rdquo; returned Charcam, respectfully; 
&ldquo;and there's a person without, anxious for an
audience, whom, with submission, I think your
honour would desire to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Rowland, glancing
significantly at Charcam, who was a confidant
in his Jacobite schemes; &ldquo;is it the messenger
from Orchard&hyphen;Windham, from Sir William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr. Corbet Kynaston, then? Sir
John Packington's courier was here yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="271">
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is from Lord Derwentwater, or
Mr. Forster? News <it>is</it> expected from
Northumberland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't exactly say, Sir Rowland. The
gentleman didn't communicate his business to
me. But I'm sure it's important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charcam said this, not because he knew anything
about the matter; but, having received a
couple of guineas to deliver the message, he,
naturally enough, estimated its importance by
the amount of the gratuity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will see him,&rdquo; replied the knight,
after a moment's pause; &ldquo;he may be from the
Earl of Mar. But let the horses be in readiness.
I shall ride to St. Alban's to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he threw himself into a chair.
And Charcam, fearful of another change in
his master's present uncertain mood, disappeared.</p>
<p><pp>The person, shortly afterwards ushered into
the room, seemed by the imperfect light,&mdash;for
the evening was advancing, and the chamber
darkened by heavy drapery,&mdash;to be a middle&hyphen;sized,
middle&hyphen;aged man, of rather vulgar appearance,</pp>
<pb n="272">
<pp>but with a very shrewd aspect. He
was plainly attired in a riding&hyphen;dress and boots
of the period, and wore a hanger by his side.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; said the
stranger, ducking his head, as he advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your business, sir?&rdquo; returned the other,
stiffly.</p>
<p>The new&hyphen;comer looked at Charcam. Sir
Rowland waved his hand, and the attendant
withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't recollect me, I presume?&rdquo; premised
the stranger, taking a seat.</p>
<p>The knight, who could ill brook this familiarity,
instantly arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't disturb yourself,&rdquo; continued the
other, nowise disconcerted by the rebuke. &ldquo;I
never stand upon ceremony where I know
I shall be welcome. We <it>have</it> met before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; rejoined Sir Rowland, haughtily; 
&ldquo;perhaps, you will refresh my memory as to
the time, and place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Let me see. The time was the 26th of
November, 1703: the place, the Mint in Southwark.</pp>
<pb n="273">
<pp>I have a good memory, you perceive,
Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>The knight staggered as if struck by a mortal
wound. Speedily recovering himself, however,
he rejoined, with forced calmness, &ldquo;You
are mistaken, sir. I was in Lancashire, at our
family seat, at the time you mention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger smiled incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; he said, after a brief
pause, during which the knight regarded him
with a searching glance, as if endeavouring to recal
his features; &ldquo;I will not gainsay your words.
You are in the right to be cautious, till you
know with whom you have to deal; and, even
then, you can't be too wary. &lsquo;Avow nothing,
believe nothing, give nothing for nothing,&rsquo; is
my own motto. And it's a maxim of universal
application; or, at least, of universal practice.
I am not come here to play the part of your
father&hyphen;confessor. I am come to serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way, sir?&rdquo; demanded Trenchard,
in astonishment.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You will learn anon. You refuse me your
confidence. I applaud your prudence: it is,</pp>
<pb n="274">
<pp>however, needless. Your history, your actions,
nay, your very thoughts are better known to
me than to your spiritual adviser.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Make good your assertions,&rdquo; cried Trenchard,
furiously, &ldquo;or&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the proof,&rdquo; interrupted the stranger,
calmly. &ldquo;You are the son of Sir Montacute
Trenchard, of Ashton&hyphen;Hall, near Manchester.
Sir Montacute had three children&mdash;two daughters
and yourself. The eldest, Constance, was
lost, by the carelessness of a servant, during her
infancy, and has never since been heard of: the
youngest, Aliva, is the present Lady Trafford.
I merely mention these circumstances to show
the accuracy of my information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is the extent of it, sir,&rdquo; returned
the knight, ironically, &ldquo;you may spare yourself
further trouble. These particulars are
familiar to all, who have any title to the knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; rejoined the stranger; &ldquo;but
I have others in reserve, not so generally
known. With your permission, I will go on
in my own way. Where I am in error, you</pp>
<pb n="275">
<pp>can set me right.&mdash;Your father, Sir Montacute
Trenchard, who had been a loyal subject of
King James the Second, and borne arms in his
service, on the abdication of that monarch,
turned his back upon the Stuarts, and would
never afterwards recognise their claims to the
crown. It was said, that he received an affront
from James, in the shape of a public reprimand,
which his pride could not forgive. Be
this as it may, though a Catholic, he died a
friend to the Protestant succession.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;So far you are correct,&rdquo; observed Trenchard; 
&ldquo;still, this is no secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suffer me to proceed,&rdquo; replied the stranger.
&ldquo;The opinions, entertained by the old knight,
naturally induced him to view with displeasure
the conduct of his son, who warmly espoused
the cause he had deserted. Finding remonstrances
of no avail, he had recourse to threats; 
and when threats failed, he adopted more decided
measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; ejaculated Trenchard.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;As yet,&rdquo; pursued the stranger, &ldquo;Sir Montacute
had placed no limit to his son's expenditure.</pp>
<pb n="276">
<pp>He did not quarrel with Rowland's
profusion, for his own revenues were ample; 
but he <it>did</it> object to the large sums lavished by
him in the service of a faction he was resolved
not to support. Accordingly, the old knight
reduced his son's allowance to a third of its
previous amount; and, upon further provocation,
he even went so far as to alter his will in
favour of his daughter, Aliva, who was then
betrothed to her cousin, Sir Cecil Trafford.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed, sir,&rdquo; said Trenchard, breathing
hard.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Under these circumstances, Rowland did
what any other sensible person would do.
Aware of his father's inflexibility of purpose,
he set his wits to work to defeat the design.
He contrived to break off his sister's match; 
and this he accomplished so cleverly, that he
maintained the strictest friendship with Sir
Cecil. For two years he thought himself secure; 
and, secretly engaged in the Jacobite
schemes of the time, in which, also, Sir Cecil
was deeply involved, he began to relax in his
watchfulness over Aliva. About this time,</pp>
<pb n="277">
<pp>&mdash;namely, in November, 1703&mdash;while young
Trenchard was in Lancashire, and his sister in
London, on a visit, he received a certain communication
from his confidential servant, Davies,
which, at once, destroyed his hopes. He learnt
that his sister was privately married&mdash;the name
or rank of her husband could not be ascertained
&mdash;and living in retirement in an obscure dwelling
in the Borough, where she had given birth
to a son. Rowland's plans were quickly formed,
and as quickly executed. Accompanied by
Sir Cecil, who still continued passionately enamoured
of his sister, and to whom he represented
that she had fallen a victim to the arts
of a seducer, he set off, at fiery speed, for the
metropolis. Arrived there, their first object
was to seek out Davies, by whom they were
conducted to the lady's retreat,&mdash;a lone habitation,
situated on the outskirts of Saint George's
Fields in Southwark. Refused admittance,
they broke open the door. Aliva's husband,
who passed by the name of Darrell, confronted
them sword in hand. For a few minutes he
kept them at bay. But, urged by his wife's</pp>
<pb n="278">
<pp>cries, who was more anxious for the preservation
of her child's life than her own, he
snatched up the infant, and made his escape
from the back of the premises. Rowland and
his companions instantly started in pursuit,
leaving the lady to recover as she might. They
tracked the fugitive to the Mint; but, like
hounds at fault, they here lost all scent of their
prey. Meantime, the lady had overtaken
them; but, terrified by the menaces of her
vindictive kinsmen, she did not dare to reveal
herself to her husband, of whose concealment
on the roof of the very house the party were
searching she was aware. Aided by an individual,
who was acquainted with a secret outlet
from the tenement, Darrell escaped. Before
his departure, he gave his assistant a glove.
That glove is still preserved. In her endeavour
to follow him, Aliva met with a severe fall,
and was conveyed away, in a state of insensibility,
by Sir Cecil. She was supposed to be
lifeless; but she survived the accident, though
she never regained her strength. Directed by
the same individual, who had helped Darrell to</pp>
<pb n="279">
<pp>steal a march upon him, Rowland, with Davies,
and another attendant, continued the pursuit.
Both the fugitive and his chasers embarked
on the Thames. The elements were wrathful
as their passions. The storm burst upon
them in its fury. Unmindful of the terrors
of the night, unscared by the danger
that threatened him, Rowland consigned his
sister's husband and his sister's child to the
waves.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring your story to an end, sir,&rdquo; said
Trenchard, who had listened to the recital with
mingled emotions of rage and fear.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I have nearly done,&rdquo; replied the stranger.
&mdash;&ldquo;As Rowland's whole crew perished in the
tempest, and he only escaped by miracle, he
fancied himself free from detection. And for
twelve years he has been so; until his long
security, well&hyphen;nigh obliterating remembrance of
the deed, has bred almost a sense of innocence
within his breast. During this period Sir
Montacute has been gathered to his fathers.
His title has descended to Rowland: his estates
to Aliva. The latter has, since, been induced to</pp>
<pb n="280">
<pp>unite herself to Sir Cecil, on terms originating
with her brother, and which, however strange
and unprecedented, were acquiesced in by the
suitor.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Sir Rowland looked bewildered with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marriage was never consummated,&rdquo; 
continued the imperturbable stranger. &ldquo;Sir
Cecil is no more. Lady Trafford, supposed to
be childless, broken in health and spirits, frail
both in mind and body, is not likely to make
another marriage. The estates must, ere long,
revert to Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you man, or fiend?&rdquo; exclaimed Trenchard,
staring at the stranger, as he concluded his
narration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are complimentary, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; returned
the other, with a grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you <it>are</it> human,&rdquo; rejoined Trenchard,
with stern emphasis, &ldquo;I insist upon knowing
whence you derived your information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might refuse to answer the question, Sir
Rowland. But I am not indisposed to gratify
you. Partly, from your confessor; partly,
from other sources.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="281">
<p>&ldquo;My confessor!&rdquo; ejaculated the knight, in
the extremity of surprise; &ldquo;has <it>he</it> betrayed
his sacred trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; replied the other, grinning; &ldquo;and
this will be a caution to you in future, how you
confide a secret of consequence to a priest. I
should as soon think of trusting a woman.
Tickle the ears of their reverences with any
idle nonsense you please: but tell them nothing
you care to have repeated. I was once
a disciple of Saint Peter myself, and speak from
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; ejaculated Trenchard,
scarcely able to credit his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm surprised you've not asked that question
before, Sir Rowland. It would have
saved me much circumlocution, and you some
suspense. My name is Wild&mdash;Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the great thief&hyphen;taker indulged himself in
a chuckle at the effect produced by this announcement.
He was accustomed to such surprises,
and enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Sir Rowland laid his hand upon his sword.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Mr. Wild,&rdquo; he said, in a sarcastic tone, but</pp>
<pb n="282">
<pp>with great firmness; &ldquo;a person of your well&hyphen;known
sagacity must be aware that some secrets
are dangerous to the possessor.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fully aware of it, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; replied
Jonathan, coolly; &ldquo;but I have nothing
to fear; because, in the first place, it will be to
your advantage not to molest me; and, in the
second, I am provided against all contingencies.
I never hunt the human tiger without being
armed. My janizaries are without. One of
them is furnished with a packet containing the
heads of the statement I have just related,
which, if I don't return at a certain time, will
be laid before the proper authorities. I have
calculated my chances, you perceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have forgotten that you are in my
power,&rdquo; returned the knight, sternly; &ldquo;and
that all your allies cannot save you from my
resentment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I can, at least, protect myself,&rdquo; replied
Wild, with provoking calmness. &ldquo;I am accounted
a fair shot, as well as a tolerable
swordsman, and I will give proof of my skill in
both lines, should occasion require it. I have</pp>
<pb n="283">
<pp>had a good many desperate engagements in my
time, and have generally come off victorious. I
bear the marks of some of them about me still,&rdquo; 
he continued, taking off his wig, and laying
bare a bald skull, covered with cicatrices and
plates of silver. &ldquo;This gash,&rdquo; he added,
pointing to one of the larger scars, &ldquo;was a wipe
from the hanger of Tom Thurland, whom I apprehended
for the murder of Mrs. Knap. This
wedge of silver,&rdquo; pointing to another, &ldquo;which
would mend a coffee&hyphen;pot, serves to stop up
a breach made by Will Colthurst, who robbed
Mr. Hearl on Hounslow&hyphen;Heath. I secured the
dog after he had wounded me. This fracture
was the handiwork of Jack Parrot (otherwise
called Jack the Grinder), who broke into the palace
of the Bishop of Norwich. Jack was a comical
scoundrel, and made a little too free with his
grace's best burgundy, as well as his grace's
favourite housekeeper. The Bishop, however,
to show him the danger of meddling with the
church, gave him a dance at Tyburn for his
pains. Not a scar but has its history. The
only inconvenience I feel from my shattered</pp>
<pb n="284">
<pp>noddle is an incapacity to drink. But that's
an infirmity shared by a great many sounder
heads than mine. The hardest bout I ever had
was with a woman&mdash;Sally Wells, who was
afterwards lagged for shoplifting. She attacked
me with a carving&hyphen;knife, and, when I had disarmed
her, the jade bit off a couple of fingers
from my left hand. Thus, you see, I've never
hesitated, and never <it>shall</it> hesitate to expose my
life where anything is to be gained. My profession
has hardened me.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>And, with this, he coolly re&hyphen;adjusted his peruke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you expect to gain from this interview,
Mr. Wild?&rdquo; demanded Trenchard, as
if he had formed a sudden resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! now we come to business,&rdquo; returned
Jonathan, rubbing his hands, gleefully. &ldquo;These
are my terms, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; he added, taking
a sheet of paper from his pocket, and pushing
it towards the knight.</p>
<p>Trenchard glanced at the document.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;A thousand pounds,&rdquo; he observed, gloomily,
&ldquo;is a heavy price to pay for doubtful</pp>
<pb n="285">
<pp>secrecy, when <it>certain silence</it> might be so
cheaply procured.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You would purchase it at the price of your
head,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, knitting his brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Rowland,&rdquo; he added, savagely, and with
somewhat of the look of a bull&hyphen;dog before he
flies at his foe, &ldquo;if it were my pleasure to do
so, I could crush you with a breath. You are
wholly in my power. Your name, with the
fatal epithet of &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; attached to it,
stands foremost on the list of Disaffected now
before the Secret Committee. I hold a warrant
from Mr. Walpole for your apprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrested!&rdquo; exclaimed Trenchard, drawing
his sword.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Put up your blade, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; rejoined
Jonathan, resuming his former calm demeanour,
&ldquo;King James the Third will need it. I have
no intention of arresting you. I have a different
game to play; and it'll be your own fault,
if you don't come off the winner. I offer you
my assistance on certain terms. The proposal
is so far from being exorbitant, that it should
be trebled if I had not a fellow&hyphen;feeling in the</pp>
<pb n="286">
<pp>cause. To be frank with you, I have an affront
to requite, which can be settled at the
same time, and in the same way with your
affair. That's worth something to me; for
I don't mind paying for revenge. After all
a thousand pounds is a trifle to rid you of
an upstart, who may chance to deprive you
of tens of thousands.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I hear you aright?&rdquo; asked Trenchard,
with startling eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, with the most
perfect <it>sangfroid</it>, &ldquo;I'll undertake to free you
from the boy. That's part of the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he alive?&rdquo; vociferated Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; returned Wild; &ldquo;he's not
only alive, but likely for life, if we don't clip
the thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Rowland caught at a chair for support,
and passed his hand across his brow, on which
the damp had gathered thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The intelligence seems new to you. I
thought I'd been sufficiently explicit,&rdquo; continued
Jonathan. &ldquo;Most persons would have
guessed my meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="287">
<p>Then it was <it>not</it> a dream!&rdquo; ejaculated Sir
Rowland in a hollow voice, and as if speaking
to himself. &ldquo;I <it>did</it> see them on the platform
of the bridge&mdash;the child and his preserver!
They were <it>not</it> struck by the fallen ruin, nor
whelmed in the roaring flood,&mdash;or, if they <it>were</it>,
they escaped as I escaped. God! I have cheated
myself into a belief that the boy perished!
And now my worst fears are realized&mdash;he
lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As yet,&rdquo; returned Jonathan, with fearful
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot&mdash;dare not injure him,&rdquo; rejoined
Trenchard, with a haggard look, and sinking,
as if paralysed, into a chair.</p>
<p>Jonathan laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He shan't
trouble you further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Sir Rowland, who appeared
completely prostrated. &ldquo;I will struggle no
longer with destiny. Too much blood has been
shed already.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;This comes of fine feelings!&rdquo; muttered
Jonathan, contemptuously. &ldquo;Give me your</pp>
<pb n="288">
<pp>thoroughpaced villain. But I shan't let him
off thus. I'll try a strong dose.&mdash;Am I to understand
that you intend to plead guilty, Sir
Rowland?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If so, I may as well
execute my warrant.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand off, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Trenchard, starting
suddenly backwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that would bring him to,&rdquo; thought
Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the boy?&rdquo; demanded Sir Rowland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, under the care of his preserver
&mdash;one Owen Wood, a carpenter, by whom he
was brought up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood!&rdquo; exclaimed Trenchard,&mdash;&ldquo;of
Wych Street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy from his shop was here a short time
ago. Could it be him you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That boy was the carpenter's apprentice,
Jack Sheppard. I've just left your nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Charcam entered the room.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; said the attendant;</pp>
<pb n="289">
<pp>&ldquo;but there's a boy from Mr. Wood,
with a message for Lady Trafford.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;From whom?&rdquo; vociferated Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr. Wood the carpenter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same who was here just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir Rowland, a much finer boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Tis he, by heaven!&rdquo; cried Jonathan; &ldquo;this
is lucky. Sir Rowland,&rdquo; he added, in a deep
whisper, &ldquo;do you agree to my terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Trenchard, in the same
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; rejoined Wild; &ldquo;he shall not
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you acquainted him with Lady Trafford's
departure?&rdquo; said the knight, addressing
Charcam, with as much composure as he could
assume.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; replied the attendant,
&ldquo;as you proposed to ride to Saint Albans tonight,
I thought you might choose to see him
yourself. Besides, there's something odd
about the boy; for, though I questioned him
pretty closely concerning his business, he declined
answering my questions, and said he</pp>
<pb n="290">
<pp>could only deliver his message to her ladyship.
I thought it better not to send him
away till I'd mentioned the circumstance to
you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You did right,&rdquo; returned Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hall,&rdquo; replied Charcam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly sir. There's another lad at
the gate waiting for him&mdash;the same who was
here just now, that Sir Rowland was speaking
of, who fastened up the jewel&hyphen;case for her ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jewel&hyphen;case!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan. &ldquo;Ah,
I see it all!&rdquo; he cried, with a quick glance.
&ldquo;Jack Sheppard's fingers are lime&hyphen;twigs. Was
anything missed after the lad's departure, Sir
Rowland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I'm aware of,&rdquo; said the knight.
&mdash;&ldquo;Stay! something occurs to me.&rdquo; And he
conferred apart with Jonathan.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; cried Wild when Trenchard
concluded. &ldquo;This young fool is come to restore
the article&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;which</pp>
<pb n="291">
<pp>Lady Trafford was anxious to conceal, and
which his companion purloined. It's precisely
what such a simpleton would do. We have
him as safe as a linnet in a cage; and could
wring his neck round as easily. Oblige me
by acting under my guidance in the matter,
Sir Rowland. I'm an old hand at such
things. Harkee,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Mr. What's&hyphen;your&hyphen;name!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Charcam,&rdquo; replied the attendant, bowing.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Very well, Mr.Charcoal, you may bring
in the boy. But not a word to him of Lady
Trafford's absence&mdash;mind that. A robbery has
been committed, and your master suspects this
lad as an accessory to the offence. He, therefore,
desires to interrogate him. It will be necessary
to secure his companion; and as you
say he is not in the house, some caution must
be used in approaching him, or he may chance
to take to his heels, for he's a slippery little
rascal. When you've seized him, cough thrice
thus,&mdash;and two rough&hyphen;looking gentlemen will
make their appearance. Don't be alarmed by
their manners, Mr. Charcoal. They're apt to be</pp>
<pb n="292">
<pp>surly to strangers, but it soon wears off. The
gentlemen with the red beard will relieve you
of your prisoner. The other must call a coach
as quickly as he can.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;For whom, sir?&rdquo; inquired Charcam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me&mdash;his master, Mr. Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are <it>you</it> Mr. Jonathan Wild?&rdquo; asked the
attendant, in great trepidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>am</it>, Charcoal. But don't let my name
frighten you. Though,&rdquo; said the thief&hyphen;taker,
with a complacent smile, &ldquo;all the world seems
to tremble at it. Obey my orders, and you've
nothing to fear. About them quickly. Lead
the lad to suppose that he'll be introduced to
Lady Trafford. You understand me, Charcoal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attendant did <it>not</it> understand him. He
was confounded by the presence in which he
found himself. But, not daring to confess his
want to comprehension, he made a profound
reverence, and retired.</p></div4>

<p>&ldquo;<smallcap>How</smallcap> do you mean to act, sir?&rdquo; inquired
Trenchard, as soon as they were left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As circumstances shall dictate, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
returned Jonathan. &ldquo;Something is sure
to arise in the course of the investigation, of
which I can take advantage. If not, I'll convey
him to St. Giles's roundhouse on my own
responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your notable scheme?&rdquo; asked the
knight, scornfully.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Once there,&rdquo; proceeded Wild, without noticing
the interruption, &ldquo;he's as good as in his
grave. The constable, Sharples, is in my pay.
I can remove the prisoner at any hour of the
night I think fit: and I <it>will</it> remove him. You
must know, Sir Rowland&mdash;for I've no secrets</pp>
<pb n="294">
<pp>from you&mdash;that, in the course of my business
I've found it convenient to become the owner
of a small Dutch sloop; by means of which I
can transmit any light ware,&mdash;such as gold
watches, rings, and plate, as well as occasionally
a bank or goldsmith's note, which has been
<it>spoken with</it> by way of the mail,&mdash;you understand
me?&mdash;to Holland or Flanders, and obtain
a secure and ready market for them. This
vessel is now in the river, off Wapping. Her
cargo is nearly shipped. She will sail, at early
dawn to&hyphen;morrow, for Rotterdam. Her commander,
Rykhart Van Galgebrok, is devoted to
my interests. As soon as he gets into blue
water, he'll think no more of pitching the boy
overboard than of lighting his pipe. This will
be safer than cutting his throat on shore. I've
tried the plan, and found it answer. The
Northern Ocean keeps a secret better than the
Thames, Sir Rowland. Before midnight, your
nephew shall be safe beneath the hatches of the
Zeeslang.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; muttered Trenchard, abstractedly; 
&ldquo;the whole scene upon the river is</pp>
<pb n="295">
<pp>passing before me. I hear the splash in the
water&mdash;I see the white object floating like a
sea&hyphen;bird on the tide&mdash;it will not sink!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;'Sblood!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan, in a tone of
ill&hyphen;disguised contempt; &ldquo;it won't do to indulge
these fancies now. Be seated, and calm yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often conjured up some frightful
vision of the dead,&rdquo; murmured the knight,
&ldquo;but I never dreamed of an interview with the
living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It'll be over in a few minutes,&rdquo; rejoined
Jonathan, impatiently; in fact, it'll be over
too soon for me. I like such interviews. But
we waste time. Have the goodness to affix
your name to that memorandum, Sir Rowland.
I require nothing, you see, till my share
of the contract is fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trenchard took up a pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's the boy's death&hyphen;warrant,&rdquo; observed
Jonathan, with a sinister smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot sign it,&rdquo; returned Trenchard.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; exclaimed Wild with a snarl,
that displayed his glistening fangs to the farthest</pp>
<pb n="296">
<pp>extremity of his mouth, &ldquo;I'm not to be
trifled with thus. That paper <it>must</it> be signed,
or I take my departure.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the knight, haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, I'll go, fast enough!&rdquo; returned
Jonathan, putting his hands into his pockets,
&ldquo;but not alone, Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, the door was flung open,
and Charcam entered, dragging in Thames,
whom he held by the collar, and who struggled
in vain to free himself from the grasp imposed
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's one of the thieves, Sir Rowland!&rdquo; 
cried the attendant. &ldquo;I was only just in time.
The young rascal had learnt from some of the
women&hyphen;servants that Lady Trafford was from
home, and was in the very act of making off
when I got down stairs. Come along, my
Newgate bird!&rdquo; he continued, shaking him
with great violence.</p>
<p>Jonathan gave utterance to a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If things had gone smoothly,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;I should have cursed the fellow's stupidity.
As it is, I'm not sorry for the blunder.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="297">
<p>Trenchard, meanwhile, whose gaze was fixed
upon the boy, became livid as death, but he
moved not a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Tis he!&rdquo; he mentally ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of your nephew, Sir
Rowland?&rdquo; whispered Jonathan, who sat with
his back towards Thames, so that his features
were concealed from the youth's view. It
would be a thousand pities, wouldn't it, to
put so promising a lad out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight fiercely
&ldquo;Give me the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan hastily picked up the pen, and
presented it to Trenchard, who attached his
signature to the document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I <it>am</it> the devil,&rdquo; observed Wild, &ldquo;as
some folks assert, and I myself am not unwilling
to believe, you'll find that I differ from
the generally&hyphen;received notions of the arch&hyphen;fiend,
and faithfully execute the commands of those
who confide their souls to my custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take hence this boy, then,&rdquo; rejoined
Trenchard; &ldquo;his looks unman me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Of what am I accused?&rdquo; asked Thames</pp>
<pb n="298">
<pp>who though a good deal alarmed at first, had
now regained his courage.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of robbery!&rdquo; replied Jonathan in a thundering
voice, and suddenly confronting him.
&ldquo;You're charged with assisting your comrade,
Jack Sheppard, to purloin certain articles of
value from a jewel&hyphen;case belonging to Lady
Trafford. Aha!&rdquo; he continued, producing a
short silver staff, which he carried constantly
about with him, and uttering a terrible imprecation,
&ldquo;I see you're confounded. Down on
your marrow&hyphen;bones, sirrah! Confess your
guilt, and Sir Rowland may yet save you from
the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've nothing to confess,&rdquo; replied Thames,
boldly; &ldquo;I've done no wrong. Are <it>you</it> my
accuser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Wild; &ldquo;have you anything
to allege to the contrary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; returned Thames: &ldquo;that the
charge is false, and malicious, and that <it>you</it>
know it to be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; retorted Jonathan. &ldquo;Come,
I must search you, my youngster!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="299">
<p>&ldquo;You shan't touch me,&rdquo; rejoined Thames; 
and, suddenly bursting from Charcam, he threw
himself at the feet of Trenchard. &ldquo;Hear me,
Sir Rowland!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I am innocent. I
have stolen nothing. This person&mdash;this Jonathan
Wild, whom I beheld for the first time,
scarcely an hour ago, in Wych Street, is&mdash;I
know not why&mdash;my enemy. He has sworn
that he'll take away my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; interrupted Jonathan. &ldquo;You won't
listen to this nonsense, Sir Rowland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you <it>are</it> innocent, boy,&rdquo; said the knight,
controlling his emotion; &ldquo;you have nothing to
apprehend. But, what brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Sir Rowland. I cannot answer
that question. My business is with Lady
Trafford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you aware that I am her ladyship's
brother?&rdquo; returned the knight. &ldquo;She has no
secrets from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; replied Thames, in some
confusion; &ldquo;but I am not at liberty to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hesitation is not in your favour,&rdquo; observed
Trenchard, sternly.</p>
<pb n="300">
<p>&ldquo;Will he consent to be searched?&rdquo; inquired
Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Thames, &ldquo;I won't be treated
like a common felon, if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be treated according to your
deserts, then,&rdquo; said Jonathan, maliciously.
And, in spite of the boy's resistance, he plunged
his hands into his pockets, and drew forth
the miniature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this from?&rdquo; asked
Wild, greatly surprised at the result of his
investigation.</p>
<p>Thames returned no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; continued Jonathan.
&ldquo;But we'll find a way to make you open
your lips presently. Bring in his comrade,&rdquo; 
he added, in a whisper to Charcam; &ldquo;I'll
take care of him. And don't neglect my instructions
this time.&rdquo; Upon which, with an
assurance that he would not do so, the attendant
departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, of course, identify this picture
as Lady Trafford's property?&rdquo; pursued Jonathan,
with a meaning glance, as he handed it
to the knight.</p>
<pb n="301">
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; replied Trenchard. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, with a sudden start, as his glance
fell upon the portrait; &ldquo;how came this into
your possession, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don't you answer, sirrah?&rdquo; cried
Wild, in a savage tone, and striking him with
the silver staff. &ldquo;Can't you speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't choose,&rdquo; replied Thames, sturdily; 
&ldquo;and your brutality shan't make me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll see that,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, dealing
him another and more violent blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; said Trenchard authoritatively.
&ldquo;I have another question to propose.
Do you know whose portrait this is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; replied Thames, repressing his
tears, &ldquo;but I believe it to be the portrait of
my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight, in astonishment.
&ldquo;Is your father alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Thames; &ldquo;he was assassinated
while I was an infant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you this is his portrait?&rdquo; demanded
Trenchard.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;My heart,&rdquo; rejoined Thames, firmly;</pp>
<pb n="302">
<pp>&ldquo;which now tells me I am in the presence of
his murderer.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;That's me,&rdquo; interposed Jonathan; &ldquo;a
thief&hyphen;taker is always a murderer in the eyes of
a thief. I'm almost sorry your suspicions are
unfounded, if your father in any way resembled
you, my youngster. But I can tell you
who'll have the pleasure of hanging your father's
son; and that's a person not a hundred
miles distant from you at this moment&mdash;ha!
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, the door was opened,
and Charcam entered, accompanied by a
dwarfish, shabby&hyphen;looking man, in a brown
serge frock, with coarse Jewish features, and
a long red beard. Between the Jew and the
attendant came Jack Sheppard; while a crowd
of servants, attracted by the news, that the
investigation of a robbery was going forward,
lingered at the doorway in hopes of catching
something of the proceedings.</p>
<p><pp>When Jack was brought in, he cast a rapid
glance around him, and perceiving Thames in
the custody of Jonathan, instantly divined how</pp>
<pb n="303">
<pp>matters stood. As he looked in this direction,
Wild gave him a significant wink, the meaning
of which he was not slow to comprehend.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Get it over quickly,&rdquo; said Trenchard, in a
whisper to the thief&hyphen;taker.</p>
<p>Jonathan nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's your name?&rdquo; he said, addressing
the audacious lad, who was looking about
him as coolly as if nothing material was
going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; returned the boy, fixing
his eyes upon a portrait of the Earl of Mar.
&ldquo;Who's that queer cove in the full&hyphen;bottomed
wig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attend to me, sirrah,&rdquo; rejoined Wild,
sternly. &ldquo;Do you know this picture?&rdquo; he
added, with another significant look, and pointing
to the miniature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Jack, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's well. Can you inform us whence
it came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;State the facts, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came from Lady Trafford's jewel&hyphen;box.'</p>
<pb n="304">
<p>Here a murmur of amazement arose from
the assemblage outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the door!&rdquo; commanded Trenchard,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; suggested
Jonathan; &ldquo;you'd better allow the court to
remain open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied the knight, who saw the
force of this reasoning. &ldquo;Continue the proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that the miniature was abstracted
from Lady Trafford's jewel&hyphen;box,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
in a loud voice. &ldquo;Who took it thence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames Darrell; the boy at your side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; cried Thames, in indignant surprise.</p>
<p>But Sheppard took no notice of the exclamation.</p>
<p>A loud buzz of curiosity circulated among
the domestics; some of whom&mdash;especially the
females&mdash;leaned forward to obtain a peep at
the culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si&mdash;lence!&rdquo; vociferated Charcam, laying
great emphasis on the last syllable.</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>388Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010111">
<pb n="305">
<p>&ldquo;Were you present at the time of the robbery?&rdquo; 
pursued Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; answered Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will swear to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; ejaculated Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; exclaimed Wild, triumphantly.
&ldquo;Close the court, Mr. Charcoal. They've
heard quite enough for my purpose,&rdquo; he muttered,
as his orders were obeyed, and the domestics
excluded. &ldquo;It's too late to carry
'em before a magistrate now, Sir Rowland; 
so, with your permission, I'll give 'em a
night's lodging in Saint Giles's roundhouse.
You, Jack Sheppard, have nothing to fear,
as you've become evidence against your accomplice.
To&hyphen;morrow, I shall carry you before
Justice Walters, who'll take your information; 
and I've no doubt but Thames Darrell
will be fully committed. Now, for the
cage, my pretty canary&hyphen;bird. Before we start,
I'll accommodate you with a pair of ruffles.&rdquo; 
And he proceeded to handcuff his captive.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Hear me!&rdquo; cried Thames, bursting into</pp>
<pb n="306">
<pp>tears. &ldquo;I am innocent. I could not have
committed this robbery. I have only just left
Wych Street. Send for Mr. Wood, and you'll
find that I've spoken the truth.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You'd better hold your peace, my lad,&rdquo; 
observed Jonathan, in a menacing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Trafford would not have thus condemned
me!&rdquo; cried Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away with him!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Rowland,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the prisoners below, Nab,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
addressing the dwarfish Jew; &ldquo;I'll
join you in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bearded miscreant seized Jack by the
waist, and Thames by the nape of the neck,
and marched off, like the ogre in the fairy
tale, with a boy under each arm, while Charcam
brought up the rear.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>They</smallcap> had scarcely been gone a moment,
when a confused noise was heard without,
and Charcam re&hyphen;entered the room, with a
countenance of the utmost bewilderment and
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the matter with the man?&rdquo; demanded
Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship&wblank;&rdquo; faltered the attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of her?&rdquo; cried the knight. &ldquo;Is she
returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; stammered Charcam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; ejaculated Jonathan. &ldquo;Here's
a cross&hyphen;bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that's not all, your honour,&rdquo; continued
Charcam; &ldquo;Mrs. Norris says she's dying.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="308">
<p>&ldquo;Dying!&rdquo; echoed the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying, Sir Rowland. She was taken dreadfully
ill on the road, with spasms and short
breath, and swoonings,&mdash;worse than ever she
was before. And Mrs. Norris was so frightened
that she ordered the postboys to drive back as
fast as they could. She never expected to get
her ladyship home alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Trenchard, stunned by
the intelligence, &ldquo;I have killed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; rejoined Wild, with a sneer; 
&ldquo;but don't let all the world know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They're lifting her out of the carriage,&rdquo; 
interposed Charcam; &ldquo;will it please your
honour to send for some advice and the chaplain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly for both,&rdquo; returned Sir Rowland, in a
tone of bitter anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; interposed Jonathan. &ldquo;Where are
the boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship will pass through it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; there's no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Then, bring them into this room, the first</pp>
<pb n="309">
<pp>thing&mdash;quick! They must not meet, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
he added, as Charcam hastened to obey
his instructions.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven has decreed it otherwise,&rdquo; replied
the knight, dejectedly. &ldquo;I yield to fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yield to nothing,&rdquo; returned Wild, trying
to re&hyphen;assure him; &ldquo;above all, when your designs
prosper. Man's fate is in his own hands.
You are your nephew's executioner, or he is
yours. Cast off this weakness. The next hour
makes, or mars you for ever. Go to your sister,
and do not quit her till all is over. Leave the
rest to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Rowland moved irresolutely towards the
door, but recoiled before a sad spectacle. This
was his sister, evidently in the last extremity.
Borne in the arms of a couple of assistants, and
preceded by Mrs. Norris, wringing her hands
and weeping, the unfortunate lady was placed
upon a couch. At the same time, Charcam,
who seemed perfectly distracted by the recent
occurrences, dragged in Thames, leaving Jack
Sheppard outside in the custody of the dwarfish
Jew.</p>
<pb n="310">
<p>&ldquo;Hell's curses!&rdquo; muttered Jonathan between
his teeth; &ldquo;that fool will ruin all. Take him
away,&rdquo; he added, striding up to Charcam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him remain,&rdquo; interposed Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; returned
Jonathan, with affected indifference; &ldquo;but I'm
not going to hunt the deer for another to eat
the ven'son, depend on't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But seeing that no notice was taken of the
retort, he drew a little aside, and folded his
arms, muttering, &ldquo;The whim will soon be over.
She can't last long. I can pull the strings of
this stiff&hyphen;necked puppet as I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Rowland, meantime, threw himself on
his knees beside his sister, and, clasping her
chilly fingers within his own, besought her forgiveness
in the most passionate terms. For a
few minutes, she appeared scarcely sensible of
his presence. But, after some restoratives had
been administered by Mrs. Norris, she revived
a little.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Rowland,&rdquo; she said, in a faint voice, &ldquo;I
have not many minutes to live. Where is
Father Spencer? I must have absolution. I</pp>
<pb n="311">
<pp>have something that weighs heavily upon my
mind.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Sir Rowland's brow darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent for him, Aliva,&rdquo; he answered; 
&ldquo;he will be here directly, with your medical
advisers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are useless,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Medicine
cannot save me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sister&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;I should die happy, if I could behold my
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfort yourself, then, Aliva. You <it>shall</it>
behold him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mocking me, Rowland. Jests are
not for seasons like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, by heaven,&rdquo; returned the knight,
solemnly. &ldquo;Leave us, Mrs. Norris, and do not
return till Father Spencer arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Norris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said Lady Trafford; &ldquo;it is my last
request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And her faithful attendant, drowned in tears,
withdrew, followed by the two assistants.</p>
<p>Jonathan stepped behind a curtain.</p>
<pb n="312">
<p>&ldquo;Rowland,&rdquo; said Lady Trafford, regarding
him with a look of indescribable anxiety, &ldquo;you
have assured me that I shall behold my son.
Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within this room,&rdquo; replied the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; shrieked Lady Trafford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; repeated her brother. &ldquo;But calm
yourself, dear sister, or the interview will be too
much for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>am</it> calm&mdash;quite calm, Rowland,&rdquo; she answered,
with lips whose agitation belied her
words. &ldquo;Then, the story of his death was
false. I knew it. I was sure you could not
have the heart to slay a child&mdash;an innocent
child. God forgive you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May He, indeed, forgive me!&rdquo; returned
Trenchard, crossing himself devoutly; &ldquo;but
my guilt is not the less heavy, because your
child escaped. This hand consigned him to
destruction, but another was stretched forth to
save him. The infant was rescued from a
watery&hyphen;grave by an honest mechanic, who has
since brought him up as his own son.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Blessings upon him!&rdquo; cried Lady Trafford,</pp>
<pb n="313">
<pp>fervently. &ldquo;But trifle with me no
longer. Moments are ages now. Let me see
my child, if he is really here?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold him!&rdquo; returned Trenchard, taking
Thames (who had been a mute, but deeply&hyphen;interested,
witness of the scene) by the hand,
and leading him towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Trafford, exerting
all her strength. &ldquo;My sight is failing me.
Let me have more light, that I may behold
him. Yes!&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;these are his
father's features! It is&mdash;it is my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Thames; &ldquo;are you, indeed,
my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed&mdash;my own sweet boy!&rdquo; she
sobbed, pressing him tenderly to her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;to see you thus!&rdquo; cried Thames, in
an agony of affliction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't weep, my love,&rdquo; replied the lady,
straining him still more closely to her. &ldquo;I am
happy&mdash;quite happy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this touching interview, a change
had come over Sir Rowland, and he half repented
of what he had done.</p>
<pb n="314">
<p>&ldquo;You can no longer refuse to tell me the
name of this youth's father, Aliva,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not, Rowland,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I
cannot break my vow. I will confide it to
Father Spencer, who will acquaint you with it
when I am no more. Undraw the curtain,
love,&rdquo; she added to Thames, &ldquo;that I may look
at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed her son, starting back, as
he obeyed her, and disclosed Jonathan Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent,&rdquo; said Jonathan, in a menacing
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo; inquired Lady
Trafford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My enemy,&rdquo; replied her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your enemy!&rdquo; she returned, imperfectly
comprehending him. &ldquo;Sir Rowland is your
uncle&mdash;he will be your guardian&mdash;he will
protect you. Will you not, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise,&rdquo; said a deep voice in Trenchard's
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will kill me,&rdquo; cried Thames. &ldquo;There
is a man in this room who seeks my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; rejoined his mother.</p>
<pb n="315">
<p>&ldquo;Look at these fetters,&rdquo; returned Thames,
holding up his manacled wrists; &ldquo;they were
put on by my uncle's command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; shrieked Lady Trafford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a moment is to be lost,&rdquo; whispered
Jonathan to Trenchard. &ldquo;His life&mdash;or yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one shall harm you more, my dear,&rdquo; 
cried Lady Trafford. &ldquo;Your uncle <it>must</it> protect
you. It will be his interest to do so. He
will be dependent on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what you please with him,&rdquo; muttered
Trenchard to Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off these chains, Rowland,&rdquo; said Lady
Trafford, &ldquo;instantly,&mdash;I command you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>I</it> will,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, advancing, and
rudely seizing Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried the son, &ldquo;help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; shrieked Lady Trafford,
raising herself on the couch, and extending
her hands towards him. &ldquo;Oh, God! would
you take him from me?&mdash;would you murder
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father's name?&mdash;and he is free,&rdquo; rejoined
Rowland, holding her arms.</p>
<pb n="316">
<p>&ldquo;Release him first&mdash;and I will disclose it!&rdquo; 
cried Lady Trafford; &ldquo;on my soul, I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak then!&rdquo; returned Rowland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; shrieked the lady, falling heavily
backwards,&mdash;&ldquo;too late!&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heedless of her cries, Jonathan passed a
handkerchief tightly over her son's mouth, and
forced him out of the room.</p>
<p>When he returned, a moment or so afterwards,
he found Sir Rowland standing by the
lifeless body of his sister. His countenance
was almost as white and rigid as that of the
corpse by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your work,&rdquo; said the knight,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, calmly; 
&ldquo;though I shouldn't be ashamed of it if it
were. After all, you failed in obtaining the secret
from her, Sir Rowland. Women are hypocrites
to the last&mdash;true only to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; cried the knight, fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence,&rdquo; returned Jonathan. &ldquo;I was
merely about to observe that <it>I</it> am in possession
of her secret.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="317">
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn't I tell you that the fugitive Darrell
gave me a glove? But we'll speak of this
hereafter. You can <it>purchase</it> the information
from me whenever you're so disposed. I
shan't drive a hard bargain. To the point,
however. I came back to say, that I've placed
your nephew in a coach; and, if you'll be at
my lock in the Old Bailey an hour after midnight,
you shall hear the last tidings of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be there,&rdquo; answered Trenchard,
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll not forget the thousand, Sir Rowland
&mdash;short accounts, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing. You shall have your reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank'ee,&mdash;thank'ee. My house is the
next door to the Cooper's Arms, in the Old
Bailey, opposite Newgate. You'll find me at
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he bowed and departed.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That man should have been an Italian
bravo,&rdquo; murmured the knight, sinking into a
chair: &ldquo;he has neither fear nor compunction.</pp>
<pb n="318">
<pp>Would I could purchase his apathy as easily as
I can procure his assistance.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Soon after this Mrs. Norris entered the
room, followed by Father Spencer. On approaching
the couch, they found Sir Rowland
senseless, and extended over the dead body of
his unfortunate sister.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Jonathan Wild</smallcap>, meanwhile, had quitted the
house. He found a coach at the door, with the
blinds carefully drawn up, and ascertained from
a tall, ill&hyphen;looking, though tawdrily&hyphen;dressed fellow,
who held his horse by the bridle, and
whom he addressed as Quilt Arnold, that the
two boys were safe inside, in the custody of
Abraham Mendez, the dwarfish Jew. As soon
as he had delivered his instructions to Quilt,
who, with Abraham, constituted his bodyguard,
or janizaries, as he termed them, Jonathan
mounted his steed, and rode off at a gallop.
Quilt was not long in following his example.
Springing upon the box, he told the coachman
to make the best of his way to Saint Giles's.
Stimulated by the promise of something handsome</pp>
<pb n="320">
<pp>to drink, the man acquitted himself to admiration
in the management of his lazy cattle.
Crack went the whip, and away floundered the
heavy vehicle through the deep ruts of the
ill&hyphen;kept road, or rather lane, (for it was little
better,) which, then, led across Southampton
Fields. Skirting the noble gardens of Montague
House, (now, we need scarcely say, the
British Museum,) the party speedily reached
Great Russell Sreet,&mdash;a quarter described by
Strype, in his edition of old Stow's famous <it>Survey</it>,
&ldquo;as being graced with the best buildings
in all Bloomsbury, and the best inhabited by the
nobility and gentry, especially the north side,
as having gardens behind the houses, and the
prospect of the pleasant fields up to Hampstead
and Highgate; insomuch that this place,
by physicians, is esteemed the most healthful
of any in London.&rdquo; Neither of the parties
outside bestowed much attention upon these
stately and salubriously&hyphen;situated mansions; indeed,
as it was now not far from ten o'clock,
and quite dark, they could scarcely discern
them. But, in spite of his general insensibility</pp>
<pb n="321">
<pp>to such matters, Quilt could not help commenting
upon the delicious perfume wafted
from the numerous flower&hyphen;beds past which
they were driving. The coachman answered
by a surly grunt, and, plying his whip with
redoubled zeal, shaped his course down Dyot
Street; traversed that part of Holborn, which
is now called Broad Street, and where two ancient
alms&hyphen;houses were, then, standing in the
middle of that great thoroughfare, exactly opposite
the opening of Compton Street; and,
diving under a wide gateway on the left, soon
reached a more open space, surrounded by
mean habitations, coach&hyphen;houses and stables,
called Kendrick Yard, at the further end of
which Saint Giles's roundhouse was situated.</pp></p>
<p><pp>No sooner did the vehicle turn the corner of
this yard, than Quilt became aware, from the
tumultuous sounds that reached his ears, as
well as from the flashing of various lanterns at
the door of the roundhouse, that some disturbance
was going on; and, apprehensive of a
rescue, if he drew up in the midst of the mob,
he thought it prudent to come to a halt. Accordingly,</pp>
<pb n="322">
<pp>he stopped the coach, dismounted,
and hastened towards the assemblage, which,
he was glad to find, consisted chiefly of a posse
of watchmen and other guardians of the night.
Quilt, who was an ardent lover of mischief,
could not help laughing most heartily at the
rueful appearance of these personages. Not
one of them but bore the marks of having
been engaged in a recent and severe conflict.
Quarter&hyphen;staves, bludgeons, brown&hyphen;bills, lanterns,
swords, and sconces were alike shivered; 
and, to judge from the sullied state of their
habiliments, the claret must have been tapped
pretty freely. Never was heard such a bawling
as these unfortunate wights kept up. Oaths
exploded like shells from a battery in full fire,
accompanied by threats of direst vengeance
against the individuals who had maltreated
them. Here, might be seen a poor fellow
whose teeth were knocked down his throat,
spluttering out the most tremendous menaces,
and gesticulating like a madman: there, another,
whose nose was partially slit, vented imprecations
and lamentations in the same breath.</pp>
<pb n="323">
<pp>On the right, stood a bulky figure, with a
broken rattle hanging out of his great&hyphen;coat
pocket, who held up a lantern to his battered
countenance to prove to the spectators that
both his orbs of vision were darkened: on the
left, a meagre constable had divested himself of
his shirt, to bind up with greater convenience a
gaping cut in the arm.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;So, the Mohocks have been at work, I perceive,&rdquo; 
remarked Quilt, as he drew near the
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Faith, an' you may say that,&rdquo; returned a
watchman, who was wiping a ruddy stream
from his brow; &ldquo;they've broken the paice,
and our pates into the bargain. But shure<it>ly</it>
I'd know that vice,&rdquo; he added, turning his lantern
towards the janizary. &ldquo;Ah! Quilt Arnold,
my man, is it you? By the powers! I'm
glad to see you. The sight o' your 'andsome
phiz allys does me good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could return the compliment,
Terry. But your cracked skull is by no means
a pleasing spectacle. How came you by the
hurt, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="324">
<p>&ldquo;How did I come by it?&mdash;that's a nate
question. Why, honestly enough. It was lent
me by a countryman o' mine; but I paid him
back in his own coin&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A countryman of yours, Terry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and a noble one, too, Quilt&mdash;more's
the pity! You've heard of the Marquis of
Slaughterford, belike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; who has not? He's the leader
of the Mohocks, the general of the Scourers,
the prince of rakes, the friend of the surgeons
and glaziers, the terror of your tribe, and the
idol of the girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's him to a hair!&rdquo; cried Terence,
rapturously. &ldquo;Och! he's a broth of a boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought he'd broken your head,
Terry?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Phooh! that's nothing'! A piece o' plaster'll
set all to rights; and Terry O'Flaherty
's not the boy to care for the stroke of a
supple&hyphen;jack. Besides, didn't I tell you that
I giv'him as good as he brought&mdash;and better!
I jist touched him with my &lsquo;Evenin&rsquo; Star,&rsquo; 
as I call this shillelah,&rdquo; said the watchman,</pp>
<pb n="325">
<pp>flourishing an immense bludgeon, the knob
of which appeared to be loaded with lead,
&ldquo;and, by Saint Patrick! down he cum'd like
a bullock.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Quilt, &ldquo;did you kill
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Terence, laughing; 
&ldquo;but I brought him to his senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By depriving him of 'em, eh? But I'm
sorry you hurt his lordship, Terry. Young
noblemen ought to be indulged in their frolics.
If they <it>do</it>, now and then, run away with a
knocker, paint a sign, beat the watch, or huff a
magistrate, they <it>pay</it> for their pastime, and
that's sufficient. What more could any reasonable
man&mdash;especially a watchman&mdash;desire?
Besides, the Marquis, is a devilish fine fellow,
and a particular friend of mine. There's not
his peer among the peerage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och! if he's a friend o' yours, my dear
joy, there's no more to be said; and right
sorry am I, I struck him. But, blood&hyphen;an'&hyphen;'ouns!
man,&hyphen;if ould Nick himself were to hit
me a blow, I'd be afther givin'him another.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="326">
<p>&ldquo;Well, well&mdash;wait a while,&rdquo; returned Quilt; 
&ldquo;his lordship won't forget you. He's as
generous as he's frolicsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the door of the roundhouse
was opened, and a stout man, with a lantern
in his hand, presented himself at the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's Sharples,&rdquo; cried Quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whist!&rdquo; exclaimed Terence; &ldquo;he elevates
his glim. By Jasus! he's about to spake
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gem'men o' the votch!&rdquo; cried Sharples,
as loudly as a wheezy cough would permit
him, &ldquo;my noble pris'ner&mdash;ough! ough;&mdash;the
Markis o' Slaughterford&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>Further speech was cut short by a volley
of execrations from the angry guardians of
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Mohocks! No Scourers!&rdquo; cried the
mob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; vociferated Quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His lordship desires me to say&mdash;ough!
ough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fresh groans and hisses.</p>
<pb n="327">
<p>&ldquo;Von't you hear me?&mdash;ough! ough!&rdquo; demanded
Sharples, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; rejoined Quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raise your vice, and lave off coughin',&rdquo; 
added Terence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The long and the short o' the matter's
this then,&rdquo; returned Sharples with dignity,
&ldquo;the Markis begs your acceptance o' ten guineas
to drink his health.</p>
<p>The hooting was instantaneously changed to
cheers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his lordship, furthermore, requests
me to state,&rdquo; proceeded Sharples, in a hoarse
tone, &ldquo;that he'll be responsible for the doctors'
bills of all such gem'men as have received
broken pates, or been other<it>wise</it> damaged in the
fray&mdash;ough! ough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the mob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We're all damaged&mdash;we've all got broken
pates,&rdquo; cried a dozen voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, good luck to him! so we have,&rdquo; rejoined
Terence; &ldquo;but we've no objection to
take out the dochter's bill in drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; replied the mob.</p>
<pb n="328">
<p>&ldquo;Your answer, gem'men?&rdquo; demanded Sharples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long life to the Markis, and we accept his
honourable proposal,&rdquo; responded the mob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long life to the Marquis!&rdquo; reiterated
Terence; &ldquo;he's an honour to ould Ireland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn't I tell you how it would be?&rdquo; remarked
Quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troth, and so did you,&rdquo; returned the watchman; 
&ldquo;but I couldn't belave it. In futur', I'll
keep the &lsquo;Evenin&rsquo; Star&rsquo; for his lordship's
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'd better,&rdquo; replied Quilt. &ldquo;But bring
your glim this way. I've a couple of kinchens
in yonder rattler, whom I wish to place under
old Sharple's care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be handy, then,&rdquo; rejoined Terence, &ldquo;or
I'll lose my share of the smart money.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>With the assistance of Terence, and a link&hyphen;boy
who volunteered his services, Quilt soon
removed the prisoners from the coach, and
leaving Sheppard to the custody of Abraham,
proceeded to drag Thames towards the roundhouse.</pp>
<pb n="329">
<pp>Not a word had been exchanged between
the two boys on the road. Whenever
Jack attempted to speak, he was checked by
an angry growl from Abraham; and Thames,
though his heart was full almost to bursting,
felt no inclination to break the silence. His
thoughts, indeed, were too painful for utterance,
and so acute were his feelings, that, for
some time, they quite overcame him. But his
grief was of short duration. The elastic spirits
of youth resumed their sway; and, before the
coach stopped, his tears had ceased to flow. As
to Jack Sheppard, he appeared utterly reckless
and insensible, and did nothing but whistle and
sing the whole way.</pp></p>
<p><pp>While he was dragged along in the manner
just described, Thames looked around to ascertain,
if possible, where he was; for he did not
put entire faith in Jonathan's threat of sending
him to the roundhouse, and was apprehensive
of something even worse than imprisonment.
The aspect of the place, so far as he could
discern through the gloom, was strange to
him; but chancing to raise his eyes above</pp>
<pb n="330">
<pp>the level of the surrounding habitations, he
beheld, relieved against the sombre sky, the
tall steeple of Saint Giles's church, the precursor
of the present structure, which was not
erected till some fifteen years later. He recognised
this object at once. Jonathan had
not deceived him.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;What's this here kinchen <it>in</it> for?&rdquo; asked
Terence, as he and Quilt strode along, with
Thames between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; rejoined Quilt, evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! nothin' partickler&mdash;mere curossity,&rdquo; 
replied Terence. &ldquo;By the powers!&rdquo; he added,
turning his lantern full upon the face of the
captive, &ldquo;he's a nice gennteel&hyphen;lookin' kiddy,
I must say. Pity he's ta'en to bad ways so
airly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may spare me your compassion,
friend,&rdquo; observed Thames; &ldquo;I am falsely detained.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; rejoined Quilt, maliciously; 
&ldquo;every thief is so. If we were to wait till a
prig was rightfully nabbed, we might tarry
till doomsday. We never supposed you helped</pp>
<pb n="331">
<pp>yourself to a picture set with diamonds&mdash; 
&mdash;not we!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the guv'ner consarned in this job?&rdquo; 
asked Terence, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; returned Quilt, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds! what's that!&rdquo; he cried, as the
noise of a scuffle was heard behind them.
&ldquo;The other kid's given my partner the slip.
Here, take this youngster, Terry; my legs
are lighter than old Nab's.&rdquo; And, committing
Thames to the care of the watchman, he darted
after the fugitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to earn a rich reward, my
good friend?&rdquo; said Thames to the watchman,
as soon as they were left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it by lettin' you go, my darlin', that
I'm to airn it?&rdquo; inquired Terence. &ldquo;If so,
it won't pay. You're Misther Wild's pris'ner,
and worse luck to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't ask you to liberate me,&rdquo; urged
Thames; &ldquo;but will you convey a message for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mr. Wood's, the carpenter in Wych
Street. He lives near the Black Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="332">
<p>&ldquo;The Black Lion!&rdquo; echoed Terence. &ldquo;I
know the house well; by the same token that
it's a flash crib. Och! many a mug o'bubb
have I drained wi' the landlord, Joe Hind.
And so Misther Wudd lives near the Black
Lion, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; replied Thames. &ldquo;Tell him
that I&mdash;his adopted son, Thames Darrell&mdash; 
am detained here by Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames Ditton&mdash;is that your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the boy, impatiently; &ldquo;Darrell
&mdash;Thames Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll not forget it. It's a mighty quare'un,
though. I never yet heard of a Christian as
was named after the Shannon or the Liffy; 
and the Thames is no better than a dhurty
puddle, compared wi' them two noble strames.
But then you're an adopted son, and that
makes all the difference. People do call their
unlawful children strange names. Are you
quite shure you haven't another alyas, Masther
Thames Ditton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell, I tell you. Will you go? You'll
be paid handsomely for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="333">
<p>&ldquo;I don't mind the throuble,&rdquo; hesitated Terence,
who was really a good&hyphen;hearted fellow at
the bottom; &ldquo;and I'd like to sarve you if I
could, for you look like a gentleman's son, and
that goes a great way wi' me. But if Misther
Wild were to find out that I thwarted his
schames&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;I'd not be in your skin for a trifle,&rdquo; interrupted
Quilt, who having secured Sheppard,
and delivered him to Abraham, now approached
them unawares; &ldquo;and it shan't be my fault
if he don't hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Ouns!&rdquo; ejaculated Terence, in alarm,
&ldquo;would you turn snitch on your old pal,
Quilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, if he plays a&hyphen;cross,&rdquo; returned Quilt.
&ldquo;Come along, my sly shaver. With all your
cunning, we're more than a match for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not for me,&rdquo; growled Terence, in an
under tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; cried Quilt, as he forced the
captive along.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Remember the devil!&rdquo; retorted Terence,
who had recovered his natural audacity. &ldquo;Do</pp>
<pb n="334">
<pp>you think I'm afeard of a beggarly thief&hyphen;taker
and his myrmidons? Not I. Masther Thames
Ditton, I'll do your biddin'; and you, Misther
Quilt Arnold, may do your worst, I defy
you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; exclaimed Quilt, turning fiercely
upon him, &ldquo;do you threaten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the watchman eluded his grasp, and,
mingling with the crowd, disappeared.</p></div4>

<subhead>SAINT GILES'S ROUNDHOUSE.</subhead> <attbytes>22Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030637</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard.

<p><pp><smallcap>Saint Giles's Roundhouse</smallcap> was an old detached
fabric, standing in an angle of Kendrick
Yard. Originally built, as its name
imports, in a cylindrical form, like a modern
Martello tower, it had undergone, from time to
time, so many alterations, that its symmetry
was, in a great measure, destroyed. Bulging
out more in the middle than at the two extremities,
it resembled an enormous cask set on
its end,&mdash;a sort of Heidelberg tun on a large
scale,&mdash;and this resemblance was increased by
the small circular aperture&mdash;it hardly deserved
to be called a door&mdash;pierced, like the
bung&hyphen;hole of a barrel, through the side of the
structure, at some distance from the ground,
and approached by a flight of wooden steps.
The prison was two stories high, with a flat</pp>
<pb n="336">
<pp>roof, surmounted by a gilt vane fashioned like
a key; and, possessing considerable internal
accommodation, it had, in its day, lodged some
thousands of disorderly personages. The windows
were small, and strongly grated, looking,
in front, on Kendrick Yard, and, at the back,
upon the spacious burial&hyphen;ground of Saint
Giles's Church. Lights gleamed from the lower
rooms, and, on a nearer approach to the building,
the sound of revelry might be heard from
within.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Warned of the approach of the prisoners by
the increased clamour, Sharples, who was busied
in distributing the Marquis's donation,
affected to throw the remainder of the money
among the crowd, though, in reality, he kept
back a couple of guineas, which he slipped into
his sleeve, and running hastily up the steps,
unlocked the door. He was followed, more
leisurely, by the prisoners; and, during their
ascent, Jack Sheppard made a second attempt
to escape by ducking suddenly down, and endeavouring
to pass under his conductor's legs.
The dress of the dwarfish Jew was not, however,</pp>
<pb n="337">
<pp>favourable to this expedient. Jack was
caught, as in a trap, by the pendant tails of
Abraham's long frock; and, instead of obtaining
his release by his ingenuity, he only got a
sound thrashing.</pp></p>
<p>Sharples received them at the threshold, and
holding his lantern towards the prisoners to acquaint
himself with their features, nodded to
Quilt, between whom and himself some secret
understanding seemed to subsist, and then
closed and barred the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; he growled, addressing Quilt, &ldquo;you
know who's here, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do,&rdquo; replied Quilt; &ldquo;my
noble friend, the Marquis of Slaughterford.
What of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vot'o that!&rdquo; echoed Sharples, peevishly:
&ldquo;Everythin'. Vot am I to do vith these young
imps, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you generally do with your prisoners,
Mr. Sharples,&rdquo; replied Quilt; &ldquo;lock 'em
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's easily said. But, suppose I've no
place to lock 'em up in, how then?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="338">
<p>Quilt looked a little perplexed. He passed
his arm under that of the constable, and drew
him aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, vell,&rdquo; growled Sharples, after he had
listened to the other's remonstrances, &ldquo;it shall
be done. But it's confounded inconwenient.
One don't often get sich a vindfal as the Markis&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Or such a customer as Mr. Wild,&rdquo; edged
in Quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Saint Giles!&rdquo; interposed
Sheppard, &ldquo;are we to be kept here all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh day!&rdquo; exclaimed Sharples: &ldquo;wot newfledged
bantam's this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One that wants to go to roost,&rdquo; replied
Sheppard. &ldquo;So, stir your stumps, Saint
Giles; and, if you mean to lock us up, use
despatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin'! comin'!&rdquo; returned the constable,
shuffling towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming!&mdash;so is midnight&mdash;so is Jonathan
Wild,&rdquo; retorted Jack, with a significant look at
Thames.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Have you never an out&hyphen;o'&hyphen;the&hyphen;vay corner,</pp>
<pb n="339">
<pp>into vich you could shtow these troublesome
warmint?&rdquo; observed Abraham. &ldquo;The guv'ner
'll be here afore midnight.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Darrell's attention was drawn to the latter
part of this speech by a slight pressure on his
foot. And, turning at the touch, he perceived
Sheppard's glance fixed meaningly upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stow it, Nab!&rdquo; exclaimed Quilt, angrily; 
&ldquo;the kinchen's awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake!&mdash;to be sure I am, my flash cove,&rdquo; 
replied Sheppard; &ldquo;I'm down as a hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've just bethought me of a crib as'll serve
their turn,&rdquo; interposed Sharples; &ldquo;at any rate,
they'll be out o' the vay, and as safe as two
chicks in a coop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead the way to it then, Saint Giles,&rdquo; said
Jack, in a tone of mock authority.</p>
<p><pp>The place, in which they stood, was a small
entrance&hyphen;chamber, cut off, like the segment of a
circle, from the main apartment, (of which it is
needless to say it originally constituted a portion,)
by a stout wooden partition. A door led
to the inner room; and it was evident, from
the peals of merriment, and other noises, that,</pp>
<pb n="340">
<pp>ever and anon, resounded from within, that this
chamber was occupied by the Marquis and his
friends. Against the walls hung an assortment
of staves, brown&hyphen;bills, (weapons then borne by
the watch,) muskets, handcuffs, great&hyphen;coats,
and lanterns. In one angle of the room stood
a disused fire&hyphen;place, with a rusty grate and
broken chimney&hyphen;piece; in the other there was
a sort of box, contrived between the wall and
the boards, that looked like an apology for a
cupboard. Towards this box Sharples directed
his steps, and, unlocking a hatch in the door,
disclosed a recess scarcely as large, and certainly
not as clean, as a dog&hyphen;kennel.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Vill this do?&rdquo; demanded the constable,
taking the candle from the lantern, the better
to display the narrow limits of the hole. &ldquo;I
call this ere crib the Little&hyphen;Ease, arter the
runaway prentices' cells in Guildhall. I <it>have</it>
squeezed three kids into it afore now. To be
sure,&rdquo; he added, lowering his tone, &ldquo;they
wos little 'uns, and one on 'em was smothered
&mdash;ough! ough!&mdash;how this cough chokes
me!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="341">
<p>Sheppard, mean while, whose hands were at
liberty, managed to possess himself, unperceived,
of the spike of a halbert, which was
lying, apart from the pole, upon a bench near
him. Having secured this implement, he burst
from his conductor, and, leaping into the hatch,
as clowns generally spring into the clock&hyphen;faces,
when in pursuit of harlequin in the pantomime,
&mdash;that is, back foremost,&mdash;broke into a fit of
loud and derisive laughter, kicking his heels
merrily all the time against the boards. His
mirth, however, received an unpleasant check; 
for Abraham, greatly incensed by his previous
conduct, caught him by the legs, and pushed
him with such violence into the hole that the
point of the spike, which he had placed in his
pocket, found its way through his clothes to
the flesh, inflicting a slight, but painful wound.
Jack, who had something of the Spartan in his
composition, endured his martyrdom without
flinching; and carried his stoical indifference
so far, as even to make a mocking grimace in
Sharples's face, while that amiable functionary
thrust Thames into the recess beside him.</p>
<pb n="342">
<p>&ldquo;How do you like your quarters, saucebox?&rdquo; 
asked Sharples, in a jeering tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than your company, Saint Giles,&rdquo; 
replied Sheppard; &ldquo;so, shut the door, and
make yourself scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy'll never rest till he finds his vay
to Bridewell,&rdquo; observed Sharples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the street,&rdquo; returned Jack: &ldquo;mind my
words, the prison's not built that can keep me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll see that, young hempseed,&rdquo; replied
Sharples, shutting the hatch furiously in his face,
and locking it. &ldquo;If you get out o' that cage,
I'll forgive you. Now, come along, gem'men,
and I'll show you some precious sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two janizaries followed him as far as
the entrance to the inner room, when Abraham,
raising his finger to his lips, and glancing
significantly in the direction of the boys, to
explain his intention to his companions, closed
the door after them, and stole softly back
again, planting himself near the recess.</p>
<p>For a few minutes all was silent. At length
Jack Sheppard observed:&mdash;&ldquo;The coast's clear.
They're gone into the next room.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="343">
<p>Darrell returned no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be angry with me, Thames,&rdquo; continued
Sheppard, in a tone calculated, as he
thought, to appease his companion's indignation.
&ldquo;I did all for the best, as I'll explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't reproach you, Jack,&rdquo; said the
other, sternly. &ldquo;I've done with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite, I hope,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard.
&ldquo;At all events, I've not done with you. If
you owe your confinement to me, you shall owe
your liberation to me, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd rather lie here for ever, than be indebted
to <it>you</it> for my freedom,&rdquo; returned
Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've done nothing to offend you,&rdquo; persisted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; echoed the other, scornfully.
&ldquo;You've perjured yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's my own concern,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard.
&ldquo;An oath weighs little with me, compared
with your safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more of this,&rdquo; interrupted Thames,
&ldquo;you make the matter worse by these excuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarrel with me as much as you please,
Thames, but hear me,&rdquo; returned Sheppard.
&ldquo;I took the course I pursued to serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="344">
<p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; cried Thames; &ldquo;you accused me
to skreen yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my soul, Thames, you wrong me!&rdquo; replied
Jack, passionately. &ldquo;I'd lay down my
life for yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect me to believe you after
what has passed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; and, more than that, I expect you
to thank me.&rdquo;</p>
<lb><lg><l>&ldquo;For procuring my imprisonment?&rdquo;</l>
<l>&ldquo;For saving your life.&rdquo;</l>
<l>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</l></lg>
<lb><p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Thames. You're in a more
serious scrape than you imagine. I overheard
Jonathan Wild's instructions to Quilt Arnold,
and though he spoke in slang, and in an under
tone, my quick ears, and acquaintance with the
thieves' lingo, enabled me to make out every
word he uttered. Jonathan is in league with
Sir Rowland to make away with you. You are
brought here that their designs may be carried
into effect with greater security. Before morning,
unless we can effect an escape, you'll be
kidnapped, or murdered, and your disappearance
attributed to the negligence of the constable.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="345">
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of this?&rdquo; asked Thames,
who, though as brave a lad as need be, could
not repress a shudder at the intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain. The moment I entered the room,
and found you a prisoner in the hands of Jonathan
Wild, I guessed how matters stood, and
acted accordingly. Things haven't gone quite
as smoothly as I anticipated; but they might
have been worse. I <it>can</it> save you, and <it>will</it>.
But, say we're friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're not deceiving me!&rdquo; said Thames,
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, by heaven!&rdquo; replied Sheppard,
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't swear, Jack, or I shall distrust you.
I can't give you my hand; but you may
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! thank you!&rdquo; faltered Jack,
in a voice full of emotion. &ldquo;I'll soon free you
from these bracelets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn't trouble yourself,&rdquo; replied
Thames. &ldquo;Mr. Wood will be here presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wood!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, in surprise.
&ldquo;How have you managed to communicate with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Abraham, who had listened attentively to</pp>
<pb n="346">
<pp>the foregoing conversation,&mdash;not a word of
which escaped him,&mdash;now drew in his breath,
and brought his ear closer to the boards.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;By means of the watchman who had the
charge of me,&rdquo; replied Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse him!&rdquo; muttered Abraham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack. &ldquo;I thought I
heard a noise. Speak lower. Somebody may
be on the watch&mdash;perhaps, that old gingerhackled
Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't care if he is,&rdquo; rejoined Thames,
boldly. &ldquo;He'll learn that his plans will be
defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may learn how to defeat yours,&rdquo; replied
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he may,&rdquo; rejoined Abraham, aloud, &ldquo;so
he may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death and fiends!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack; &ldquo;the
old thief <it>is</it> there. I knew it. You've betrayed
yourself, Thames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vot o' that?&rdquo; chuckled Abraham. &ldquo;<it>You</it>
can shave him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>can</it>,&rdquo; rejoined Jack; &ldquo;and you, too, old
Aaron, if I'd a razor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon do you expect Mishter Vudd?&rdquo; 
inquired the janizary, tauntingly.</p>
<pb n="347">
<p>&ldquo;What's that to you?&rdquo; retorted Jack, surlily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I shouldn't like to be out o'
the vay ven he arrives,&rdquo; returned Abraham,
in a jeering tone; &ldquo;it vouldn't be vell bred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vouldn't it!&rdquo; replied Jack, mimicking his
snuffling voice; &ldquo;then shtay vere you are, and
be cursed to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's all up,&rdquo; muttered Thames. &ldquo;Mr.
Wood will be intercepted. I've destroyed my
only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your <it>only</it> chance, Thames,&rdquo; returned
Jack, in the same undertone; &ldquo;but your best.
Never mind. We'll turn the tables upon 'em
yet. Do you think we could manage that old
clothesman between us, if we got out of this
box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd manage him myself, if my arms were
free,&rdquo; replied Thames, boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shpeak up, vill you?&rdquo; cried Abraham, rapping
his knuckles against the hatch. &ldquo;I likes
to hear vot you says. You <it>can</it> have no shecrets
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vy don't you talk to your partner, or
Saint Giles, if you vant conversation, Aaron?&rdquo; 
asked Jack, slily.</p>
<pb n="348">
<p>&ldquo;Because they're in the next room, and the
door's shut; that's vy, my jack&hyphen;a&hyphen;dandy!&rdquo; 
replied Abraham, unsuspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they are&mdash;are they?&rdquo; muttered Jack,
triumphantly; &ldquo;that'll do. Now for it,
Thames! Make as great a row as you can to
divert his attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, he drew the spike from his
pocket; and, drowning the sound of the
operation by whistling, singing, shuffling, and
other noises, contrived, in a few minutes, to
liberate his companion from the handcuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack,&rdquo; cried Thames, warmly grasping
Sheppard's hand, &ldquo;you are my friend
again. I freely forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheppard cordially returned the pressure; 
and, cautioning Thames, &ldquo;not to let the ruffles
drop, or they might tell a tale,&rdquo; began to warble
the following fragment of a robber melody:&mdash; 
<lb><lg><l>&ldquo;Oh! give me a chisel, a knife, or a file,</l>
<l>And the dubsmen shall find that I'll do it in style!</l>
<l align="r"><it>Tol&hyphen;de&hyphen;rol</it>!&rdquo;</l></lg></p>
<lb><p>&ldquo;Vot the devil are you about, noisy?&rdquo; inquired
Abraham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practising singing, Aaron,&rdquo; replied Jack.
&ldquo;Vot are you?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="349">
<p>&ldquo;Practising patience,&rdquo; growled Abraham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before it's needed,&rdquo; returned Jack,
aloud; adding in a whisper, &ldquo;get upon my
shoulders, Thames. Now you're up, take this
spike. Feel for the lock, and prize it open,&mdash; 
you don't need to be told <it>how</it>. When it's
done, I'll push you through. Take care of the
old clothesman, and leave the rest to me.</p>
<lb><lg><l>When the turnkey, next morning, stepp'd into his room,</l>
<l>The sight of the hole in the wall struck him dumb;</l>
<l>The sheriff's black bracelets lay strewn on the ground,</l>
<l>But the lad that had worn'em could nowhere be found.</l>
<l align="r"><it>Tol&hyphen;de&hyphen;rol</it>!&rdquo;</l></lg>
<lb><p>As Jack concluded his ditty, the door flew
open with a crash, and Thames sprang through
the aperture.</p>
<p><pp>This man&oelig;uvre was so suddenly executed
that it took Abraham completely by surprise.
He was standing at the moment close to the
hatch, with his ear at the keyhole, and received
a severe blow in the face. He staggered back a
few paces; and, before he could recover himself,
Thames tripped up his heels, and, placing
the point of the spike at his throat, threatened
to stab him if he attempted to stir, or cry out.
Nor had Jack been idle all this time. Clearing
the recess the instant after his companion, he</pp>
<pb n="350">
<pp>flew to the door of the inner room, and, locking
it, took out the key. The policy of this step
was immediately apparent. Alarmed by the
noise of the scuffle, Quilt and Sharples rushed
to the assistance of their comrade. But they
were too late. The entrance was barred against
them; and they had the additional mortification
of hearing Sheppard's loud laughter at their
discomfiture.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you the prison wasn't built that could
hold me,&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're not out yet, you young hound,&rdquo; rejoined
Quilt, striving ineffectually to burst open
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I soon shall be,&rdquo; returned Jack; 
&ldquo;take these,&rdquo; he added, flinging the handcuffs
against the wooden partition, &ldquo;and wear 'em
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, Nab!&rdquo; vociferated Quilt. &ldquo;What
the devil are you about? Will you allow
yourself to be beaten by a couple of kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it,&rdquo; returned Abraham,
making a desperate effort to regain his feet.
&ldquo;By my shalvation, boy,&rdquo; he added, fiercely,
&ldquo;if you don't take your hand off my peard, I'll
shtrangle you.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="351">
<p>&ldquo;Help me, Jack!&rdquo; shouted Thames, &ldquo;or I
shan't be able to keep the villain down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick the spike into him, then,&rdquo; returned
Sheppard, coolly, &ldquo;while I unbar the outlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Thames had no intention of following
his friend's advice. Contenting himself with
brandishing the weapon in the Jew's eyes, he
exerted all his force to prevent him from rising.</p>
<p>While this took place, while Quilt thundered
at the inner door, and Jack drew back the
bolts of the outer, a deep, manly voice was
heard chanting&mdash;as if in contempt of the general
uproar&mdash;the following strain:&mdash; 
<lb><lg><l>With pipe and punch upon the board,</l>
<l>&indent;And smiling nymphs around us;</l>
<l>No tavern could more mirth afford</l>
<l>&indent;Than old Saint Giles's roundhouse!</l>
<l align="r"><it>The roundhouse</it>! <it>the roundhouse</it>!</l>
<l align="r"><it>The jolly&mdash;jolly roundhouse</it>!</l></lg></p>
<lb><p>&ldquo;The jolly, jolly roundhouse!&rdquo; chorussed
Sheppard, as the last bar yielded to his efforts.
&ldquo;Hurrah! come along, Thames; we're free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sho fasht&mdash;not sho fasht!&rdquo; cried
Abraham, struggling with Thames, and detaining
him; &ldquo;if you go, you musht take me along
vid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Save yourself, Jack!&rdquo; shouted Thames,</pp>
<pb n="352">
<pp>sinking beneath the superior weight and
strength of his opponent; &ldquo;leave me to my
fate!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Jack, hurrying towards
him. And, snatching the spike from Thames,
he struck the janizary a severe blow on the
head. &ldquo;I'll make sure work this time,&rdquo; he
added, about to repeat the blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; interposed Thames, &ldquo;he can do no
more mischief. Let us be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; returned Jack, leaping up; 
&ldquo;but I feel devilishly inclined to finish him.
However, it would only be robbing the hangman
of his dues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, he was preparing to follow his
friend, when their egress was prevented by
the sudden appearance of Jonathan Wild and
Blueskin.</p></div4></div3>

may be conceived, was thrown into the utmost
confusion and distress by the unaccountable
disappearance of the two boys. As time wore
on, and they did not return, Mr. Wood's
anxiety grew so insupportable, that he seized
his hat with the intention of sallying forth in
search of them, though he did not know whither
to bend his steps, when his departure was
arrested by a gentle knock at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; cried Winifred, starting up,
joyfully, and proving by the exclamation that
her thoughts were dwelling upon one subject
only. &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="4">
<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; said her father, with a doubtful
shake of the head. &ldquo;Thames would let
himself in; and Jack generally finds an entrance
through the backdoor or the shop&hyphen;window,
when he has been out at untimely hours.
But, go and see who it is, love. Stay! I'll go
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His daughter, however, anticipated him.
She flew to the door, but returned the next
minute, looking deeply disappointed, and
bringing the intelligence that it was &ldquo;only
Mrs. Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; almost screamed Mrs. Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Sheppard's mother.&rdquo; answered the
little girl, dejectedly; &ldquo;she has brought a
basket of eggs from Willesden, and some
flowers for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; vociferated Mrs. Wood, in indignant
surprise. &ldquo;Eggs for <it>me</it>! You
mistake, child. They must be for your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I'm quite sure she said they're for
you,&rdquo; replied Winifred; &ldquo;but she <it>does</it> want
to see father.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="5">
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; sneered Mrs. Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll go to her directly,&rdquo; said Wood,
bustling towards the door. &ldquo;I dare say she
has called to inquire about Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say no such thing,&rdquo; interposed his
better half, authoritatively; &ldquo;remain where
you are, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all events, let me send her away, my
dear,&rdquo; supplicated the carpenter, anxious to
avert the impending storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo; cried the lady, with
increasing vehemence. &ldquo;Stir a foot, at your
peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my love,&rdquo; still remonstrated Wood,
&ldquo;you know I'm going to look after the
boys&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Mrs. Sheppard, you mean, sir,&rdquo; interrupted
his wife, ironically. &ldquo;Don't think
to deceive me by your false pretences. Marry,
come up! I'm not so easily deluded. Sit
down, I command you. Winny, show the
person into this room. I'll see her myself; 
and that's more than she bargained for, I'll be
sworn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Finding it useless to struggle further, Mr.</pp>
<pb n="6">
<pp>Wood sank, submissively, into a chair, while
his daughter hastened to execute her arbitrary
parent's commission.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;At length, I have my wish,&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Wood, regarding her husband with a
glance of vindictive triumph. &ldquo;I shall behold
the shameless hussy, face to face; and, if I find
her as good&hyphen;looking as she's represented, I
don't know what I'll do in the end; but I'll
begin by scratching her eyes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>In this temper, it will naturally be imagined,
that Mrs. Wood's reception of the widow, who,
at that moment, was ushered into the room by
Winifred, was not particularly kind and encouraging.
As she approached, the carpenter's
wife eyed her from head to foot, in the
hope of finding something in her person or apparel
to quarrel with. But she was disappointed.
Mrs. Sheppard's dress&mdash;extremely
neat and clean, but simply fashioned, and of
the plainest and most unpretending material,
&mdash;offered nothing assailable; and her demeanour
was so humble, and her looks so modest,
that&mdash;if she had been ill&hyphen;looking&mdash;she might,
possibly, have escaped the shafts of malice</pp>
<pb n="7">
<pp>preparing to be levelled against her. But,
alas! she was beautiful&mdash;and beauty is a crime
not to be forgiven by a jealous woman.</pp></p>
<p><pp>As the lapse of time and change of circumstances
have wrought a remarkable alteration
in the appearance of the poor widow, it may
not be improper to notice it here. When first
brought under consideration, she was a miserable
and forlorn object; squalid in attire, haggard
in looks, and emaciated in frame. Now,
she was the very reverse of all this. Her dress,
it has just been said, was neatness and simplicity
itself. Her figure, though slight, had all
the fulness of health; and her complexion&mdash; 
still pale, but without its former sickly cast,&mdash; 
contrasted agreeably, by its extreme fairness,
with the dark brows and darker lashes that
shaded eyes which, if they had lost some of
their original brilliancy, had gained infinitely
more in the soft and chastened lustre that replaced
it. One marked difference between the
poor outcast, who, oppressed by poverty, and
stung by shame, had sought temporary relief
in the stupifying draught,&mdash;that worst &ldquo;medicine</pp>
<pb n="8">
<pp>of a mind diseased,&rdquo;&mdash;and those of the
same being, freed from her vices, and restored
to comfort and contentment, if not to happiness,
by a more prosperous course of events,
was exhibited in the mouth. For the fresh and
feverish hue of lip which years ago characterised
this feature, was now substituted a pure
and wholesome bloom, evincing a total change
of habits; and, though the coarse character of
the mouth remained, in some degree, unaltered,
it was so modified in expression, that it
could no longer be accounted a blemish. In
fact, the whole face had undergone a transformation.
All its better points were improved,
while the less attractive ones (and they were
few in comparison) were subdued, or removed.
What was yet more worthy of note was, that
the widow's countenance had an air of refinement
about it, of which it was utterly destitute
before, and which seemed to intimate that her
true position in society was far above that
wherein accident had placed her.</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; said the carpenter,
advancing to meet her, and trying to look</pp>
<pb n="9">
<pp>as cheerful and composed as he could; &ldquo;what
brings you to town, eh?&mdash;Nothing amiss, I
trust?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever, sir,&rdquo; answered the
widow. &ldquo;A neighbour offered me a drive to
Paddington; and, as I haven't heard of my
son for some time, I couldn't resist the temptation
of stepping on to inquire after him, and
to thank you for your great goodness to us
both. I've brought a little garden&hyphen;stuff and a
few new&hyphen;laid eggs for you, ma'am,&rdquo; she added,
turning to Mrs. Wood, who appeared to be collecting
her energies for a terrible explosion,
&ldquo;in the hope that they may prove acceptable.
Here's a nosegay for you, my love,&rdquo; she continued,
opening her basket, and presenting a
fragrant bunch of flowers to Winifred, &ldquo;if
your mother will allow me to give it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't touch it, Winny!&rdquo; screamed Mrs.
Wood, &ldquo;it may be poisoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not afraid, mother,&rdquo; said the little
girl, smelling at the bouquet. &ldquo;How sweet
these roses are! Shall I put them into
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Put them where they came from,&rdquo; replied</pp>
<pb n="10">
<pp>Mrs. Wood, severely, &ldquo;and go to
bed.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mother, mayn't I sit up to see
whether Thames returns?&rdquo; implored Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it matter to you whether he returns
or not, child,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Wood,
sharply. &ldquo;I've spoken. And my word's
law&mdash;with <it>you</it>, at least,&rdquo; she added, bestowing
a cutting glance upon her husband.</p>
<p>The little girl uttered no remonstrance; but,
replacing the flowers in the basket, burst into
tears, and withdrew.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard, who witnessed this occurrence
with dismay, looked timorously at Wood,
in expectation of some hint being given as to
the course she had better pursue; but, receiving
none, for the carpenter was too much agitated
to attend to her, she ventured to express
a fear that she was intruding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intruding!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Wood; &ldquo;to be
sure you are! I wonder how you dare show
your face in this house, hussy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you sent for me, ma'am,&rdquo; replied
the widow, humbly.</p>
<pb n="11">
<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Wood; &ldquo;and I
did so to see how far your effrontery would
carry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I'm very sorry. I hope I
haven't given any unintentional offence?&rdquo; said
the widow, again meekly appealing to Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't exchange glances with him under
my very nose, woman!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Wood; 
&ldquo;I'll not bear it. Look at me, and answer
me one question. And, mind! no prevaricating
&mdash;nothing but the truth will satisfy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard raised her eyes, and fixed
them upon her interrogator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not that man's mistress?&rdquo; demanded
Mrs. Wood, with a look meant to
reduce her supposed rival to the dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no man's mistress,&rdquo; answered the
widow, crimsoning to her temples, but preserving
her meek deportment, and humble tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's false!&rdquo; cried Mrs Wood. &ldquo;I'm
too well acquainted with your proceedings, madam,
to believe that. Profligate women are
never reclaimed. <it>He</it> has told me sufficient of
you&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="12">
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; interposed Wood, &ldquo;for goodness'
sake&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>will</it> speak,&rdquo; screamed his wife, totally
disregarding the interruption; &ldquo;I <it>will</it> tell this
worthless creature what I know about her,&mdash; 
and what I think of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, my love&mdash;not now,&rdquo; entreated
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <it>now</it>,&rdquo; rejoined the infuriated dame; 
&ldquo;perhaps, I may never have another opportunity.
She has contrived to keep out of my
sight up to this time, and I've no doubt she'll
keep out of it altogether for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my doing, dearest,&rdquo; urged the
carpenter; &ldquo;I was afraid if you saw her that
some such scene as this might occur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, madam, I beseech you,&rdquo; interposed
Mrs. Sheppard, &ldquo;and, if it please you
to visit your indignation on any one, let it be
upon me, and not on your excellent husband,
whose only fault is in having bestowed his charity
upon so unworthy an object as myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unworthy, indeed!&rdquo; sneered Mrs. Wood.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;To him I owe everything,&rdquo; continued the</pp>
<pb n="13">
<pp>widow, &ldquo;life itself&mdash;nay, more than life,&mdash;for,
without his assistance I should have perished,
body and soul. He has been a father to me
and my child.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I never doubted the latter point, I assure
you, madam,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have said,&rdquo; pursued the widow, &ldquo;that
she, who has once erred, is irreclaimable. Do
not believe it, madam. It is not so. The poor
wretch, driven by desperation to the commission
of a crime which her soul abhors, is no
more beyond the hope of reformation than she
is without the pale of mercy. I have suffered
&mdash;I have sinned&mdash;I have repented. And,
though neither peace nor innocence can be restored
to my bosom; though tears cannot blot
out my offences, nor sorrow drown my shame; 
yet, knowing that my penitence is sincere, I do
not despair that my transgressions may be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty fine!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Wood,
contemptuously.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You cannot understand me, madam; and
it is well you cannot. Blest with a fond husband,
surrounded by every comfort, <it>you</it> have</pp>
<pb n="14">
<pp>never been assailed by the horrible temptations
to which misery has exposed <it>me</it>. You have
never known what it is to want food, raiment,
shelter. You have never seen the child within
your arms perishing from hunger, and no relief
to be obtained. You have never felt the
hearts of all hardened against you; have never
heard the jeer or curse from every lip; nor
endured the insult and the blow from every
hand. I <it>have</it> suffered all this. I could resist
the tempter <it>now</it>. I am strong in health,&mdash;in
mind. But <it>then</it>&wblank;Oh! madam, there are
moments&mdash;moments of darkness, which overshadow
a whole existence&mdash;in the lives of the
poor houseless wretches who traverse the
streets, when reason is well&hyphen;nigh benighted; 
when the horrible promptings of despair can,
alone, be listened to; and when vice itself
assumes the aspect of virtue. Pardon what I
have said, madam. I do not desire to extenuate
my guilt&mdash;far less to defend it; but I
would show you, and such as you&mdash;who, happily,
are exempted from trials like mine&mdash;how
much misery has to do with crime. And I
affirm to you, on my own conviction, that she</pp>
<pb n="15">
<pp>who falls, because she has not strength granted
her to struggle with affliction, <it>may</it> be reclaimed,
&mdash;may repent, and be forgiven,&mdash;even as she,
whose sins, &lsquo;though many, were forgiven her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It gladdens me to hear you talk thus,
Joan,&rdquo; said Wood, in a voice of much emotion,
while his eyes filled with tears, &ldquo;and
more than repays me for all I have done for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If professions of repentance constitute a
Magdalene, Mrs. Sheppard is one, no doubt,&rdquo; 
observed Mrs. Wood, ironically; &ldquo;but I used
to think it required something more than <it>mere
words</it> to prove that a person's character was
abused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very right, my love,&rdquo; said Wood, &ldquo;very
sensibly remarked. So it does. But I can
speak to that point. Mrs. Sheppard's conduct,
from my own personal knowledge, has
been unexceptionable for the last twelve years.
During that period she has been a model of
propriety.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Oh! of course,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Wood; 
&ldquo;I can't for an instant question such disinterested
testimony. Mrs. Sheppard, I'm sure,</pp>
<pb n="16">
<pp>will say as much for you. He's a model of
conjugal attachment and fidelity, a pattern to
his family, and an example to his neighbours.
Ain't he, madam?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, indeed,&rdquo; replied the widow, fervently; 
&ldquo;more&mdash;much more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's no such thing!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wood,
furiously. &ldquo;He's a base, deceitful, tyrannical,
hoary&hyphen;headed libertine&mdash;that's what he
is. But, I'll expose him. I'll proclaim his
misdoings to the world; and, then, we shall
see where he'll stand. Marry, come up! I'll
show him what an injured wife can do. If all
wives were of my mind and my spirit, husbands
would soon be taught their own insignificance.
But a time <it>will</it> come (and that before long,)
when our sex will assert its superiority; and,
when we have got the upper hand, let 'em try
to subdue us if they can. But don't suppose,
madam, that anything I say has reference to
you. I'm speaking of virtuous women&mdash;of
<smallcap>wives</smallcap>, madam. Mistresses neither deserve
consideration nor commiseration.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I expect no commiseration,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Sheppard, gently, &ldquo;nor do I need any.</pp>
<pb n="17">
<pp>But, rather than be the cause of any further
misunderstanding between you and my benefactor,
I will leave London and its neighbourhood
for ever.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do so, madam,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Wood,
&ldquo;and take your son with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son!&rdquo; echoed the widow, trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your son, madam. If you can do
any good with him, it's more than we can.
The house will be well rid of him, for a more
idle, good&hyphen;for&hyphen;nothing reprobate never crossed
its threshold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true, sir?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard,
with an agonised look at Wood. &ldquo;I know
you'll not deceive me. Is Jack what Mrs.
Wood represents him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's not exactly what I could desire him
to be, Joan,&rdquo; replied the carpenter, reluctantly.
&ldquo;But a ragged colt sometimes makes
the best horse. He'll mend, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wood,&mdash;&ldquo;he'll never
mend. He has taken more than one step
towards the gallows already. Thieves and
pickpockets are his constant companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieves!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sheppard, horror&hyphen;stricken.</p>
<pb n="18">
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan Wild and Blueskin have got him
into their hands,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the widow,
wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you doubt my word, woman,&rdquo; replied
the carpenter's wife, coldly, &ldquo;ask Mr.
Wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you'll contradict it, sir,&rdquo; said the
widow, looking at Wood as if she dreaded to
have her fears confirmed,&mdash;&ldquo;I know you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could, Joan,&rdquo; returned the carpenter,
sadly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard let fall her basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; she murmured, wringing her
hands piteously,&mdash;&ldquo;my son the companion of
thieves! My son in Jonathan Wild's power!
It cannot be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Wood, in a
taunting tone. &ldquo;Your son's father was a
thief; and Jonathan Wild (unless I'm misinformed,)
was his friend,&mdash;so it's not unnatural
he should show some partiality towards
Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Jonathan Wild was my husband's bitterest
enemy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;He first</pp>
<pb n="19">
<pp>seduced him from the paths of honesty, and
then betrayed him to a shameful death, and
he has sworn to do the same thing by my
son. Oh, heavens; that I should have ever
indulged a hope of happiness while that terrible
man lives!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Compose yourself, Joan,&rdquo; said Wood; 
&ldquo;all will yet be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard,
distractedly. &ldquo;All cannot be well, if this is true.
Tell me, sir,&rdquo; she added, with forced calmness,
and grasping Wood's arm; &ldquo;what has Jack
done? Tell me in a word, that I may know
the worst. I can bear anything but suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're agitating yourself unnecessarily,
Joan,&rdquo; returned Wood, in a soothing voice.
&ldquo;Jack has been keeping bad company. That's
the only fault I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs.
Sheppard, fervently. &ldquo;Then it is not too late
to save him. Where is he, sir? Can I see
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No, that you can't,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Wood; 
&ldquo;he has gone out without leave, and has taken
Thames Darrell with him. If I were Mr. Wood,</pp>
<pb n="20">
<pp>when he <it>does</it> return, I'd send him about his
business. I wouldn't keep an apprentice to
set my authority at defiance.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Mr. Wood's reply, if he intended any, was
cut short by a loud knocking at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Odd's&hyphen;my&hyphen;life!&mdash;what's that?&rdquo; he cried,
greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's Jonathan Wild come back with a
troop of constables at his heels, to search the
house,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Wood, in equal trepidation.
&ldquo;We shall all be murdered. Oh! that
Mr. Kneebone were here to protect me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it <it>is</it> Jonathan,&rdquo; rejoined Wood, &ldquo;it
is very well for Mr. Kneebone he's not
here. He'd have enough to do to protect himself,
without attending to you. I declare I'm
almost afraid to go to the door. Something,
I'm convinced, has happened to the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Jonathan Wild been here to&hyphen;day?&rdquo; 
asked Mrs. Sheppard, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure he has!&rdquo; returned Mrs. Wood; 
&ldquo;and Blueskin, too. They're only just gone.
Mercy on us! what a clatter,&rdquo; she added, as
the knocking was repeated more violently than
before.</p>
<pb n="21">
<p>While the carpenter irresolutely quitted the
room, with a strong presentiment of ill upon
his mind, a light quick step was heard descending
the stairs, and, before he could call out to
prevent it, a man was admitted into the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Misther Wudd's, my pretty miss?&rdquo; 
demanded the rough voice of the Irish watchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Winifred; &ldquo;have you
brought any tidings of Thames Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troth have I!&rdquo; replied Terence; &ldquo;but,
bless your angilic face, how did you contrive
to guess that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he well?&mdash;is he safe?&mdash;is he coming
back,&rdquo; cried the little girl, disregarding the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's in St. Giles's roundhouse,&rdquo; answered
Terence; &ldquo;but tell Mr. Wudd I'm here, and
have brought him a message from his unlawful
son, and don't be detainin' me, my darlin', for
there's not a minute to lose if the poor lad's to
be rescued from the clutches of that thief and
thieftaker o' the wurld, Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>The carpenter, upon whom no part of this</pp>
<pb n="22">
<pp>hurried dialogue had been lost, now made his
appearance, and having obtained from Terence
all the information which that personage could
impart respecting the perilous situation of
Thames, he declared himself ready to start to
Saint Giles's at once, and ran back to the room
for his hat and stick; expressing his firm determination,
as he pocketed his constable's staff
with which he though it expedient to arm himself,
of being direfully revenged upon the thieftaker:
a determination in which he was strongly
encouraged by his wife. Terence, meanwhile,
who had followed him, did not remain silent,
but recapitulated his story, for the benefit of
Mrs. Sheppard. The poor widow was thrown
into an agony of distress on learning that a
robbery had been committed, in which her son
(for she could not doubt that Jack was one of
the boys,) was implicated; nor was her anxiety
alleviated by Mrs. Wood, who maintained
stoutly, that if Thames had been led to do
wrong, it must be through the instrumentality
of his worthless companion.</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;And there you're right, you may dipind,
marm,&rdquo; observed Terence. &ldquo;Master Thames</pp>
<pb n="23">
<pp>Ditt&mdash;what's his blessed name?&mdash;has honesty
written in his handsome phiz; but as to his
companion, Jack Sheppard, I think you call
him, he's a born and bred thief. Lord bless
you marm! we sees plenty on'em in our purfession.
Them young prigs is all alike. I
seed he was one,&mdash;and a sharp un, too,&mdash;at a
glance.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the widow, covering her
face with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a drop of brandy before we start,
watchman,&rdquo; said Wood, pouring out a glass of
spirit, and presenting it to Terence, who smacked
his lips as he disposed of it. &ldquo;Won't you
be persuaded, Joan?&rdquo; he added, making a similar
offer to Mrs. Sheppard, which she gratefully
declined. &ldquo;If you mean to accompany
us, you may need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, sir,&rdquo; returned the
widow, &ldquo;but I require no support. Nothing
stronger than water has passed my lips for
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;We may believe as much of that as we
please, I suppose,&rdquo; observed the carpenter's
wife, with a sneer. &ldquo;Mr. Wood,&rdquo; she continued,</pp>
<pb n="24">
<pp>in an authoritative tone, seeing her
husband ready to depart, &ldquo;one word before
you set out. If Jack Sheppard or his mother
ever enter this house again, I leave it&mdash;that's
all. Now, do what you please. You know
<it>my</it> fixed determination.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>Mr. Wood made no reply; but, hastily kissing
his weeping daughter, and bidding her be
of good cheer, hurried off. He was followed
with equal celerity by Terence and the widow.
Traversing what remained of Wych Street at a
rapid pace, and speeding along Drury Lane,
the trio soon found themselves in Kendrick
Yard. When they came to the roundhouse,
Terry's courage failed him. Such was the terror
inspired by Wild's vindictive character,
that few durst face him who had given him
cause for displeasure. Aware that he should
incur the thieftaker's bitterest animosity by
what he had done, the watchman, whose wrath
against Quilt Arnold had evaporated during
the walk, thought it more prudent not to hazard
a meeting with his master, till the storm
had, in some measure, blown over. Accordingly,
having given Wood such directions as he</pp>
<pb n="25">
<pp>thought necessary for his guidance, and received
a handsome gratuity in return for his
services, he departed.</pp></p>
<p><pp>It was not without considerable demur and
delay on the part of Sharples that the carpenter
and his companion could gain admittance to
the roundhouse. Reconnoitring them through
a small grated loophole, he refused to open
the door till they had explained their business.
This, Wood, acting upon Terry's caution, was
most unwilling to do; but, finding he had no
alternative, he reluctantly made known his
errand and the bolts were undrawn. Once in,
the constable's manner appeared totally changed.
He was now as civil as he had just been
insolent. Apologizing for their detention, he
answered the questions put to him respecting
the boys, by positively denying that any such
prisoners had been entrusted to his charge,
but offered to conduct him to every cell in the
building to prove the truth of his assertion.
He then barred and double&hyphen;locked the door,
took out the key, (a precautionary measure
which, with a grim smile, he said he never
omitted,) thrust it into his vest, and motioning</pp>
<pb n="26">
<pp>the couple to follow him, led the way to
the inner room. As Wood obeyed, his foot
slipped; and, casting his eyes upon the floor,
he perceived it splashed in several places with
blood. From the freshness of the stains,
which grew more frequent as they approached
the adjoining chamber, it was evident some
violence had been recently perpetrated, and the
carpenter's own blood froze within his veins as
he thought, with a thrill of horror, that, perhaps
on this very spot, not many minutes
before his arrival, his adopted son might have
been inhumanly butchered. Nor was this
impression removed as he stole a glance at
Mrs. Sheppard, and saw from her terrified look
that she had made the same alarming discovery
as himself. But it was now too late to
turn back, and, nerving himself for the shock
he expected to encounter, he ventured after his
conductor. No sooner had they entered the
room than Sharples, who waited to usher them
in, hastily retreated, closed the door, and turning
the key, laughed loudly at the success of
his stratagem. Vexation at his folly in suffering
himself to be thus entrapped kept Wood for</pp>
<pb n="27">
<pp>a short time silent. When he could find words,
he tried by the most urgent solicitations to
prevail upon the constable to let him out. But
threats and entreaties&mdash;even promises were ineffectual; 
and the unlucky captive, after exhausting
his powers of persuasion, was compelled
to give up the point.</pp></p>
<p>The room in which he was detained&mdash;that
lately occupied by the Mohocks, who, it appeared,
had been allowed to depart,&mdash;was
calculated to inspire additional apprehension
and disgust. Strongly impregnated with the
mingled odours of tobacco, ale, brandy, and
other liquors, the atmosphere was almost
stifling. The benches running round the room; 
though fastened to the walls by iron clamps,
had been forcibly wrenched off; while the
table, which was similarly secured to the
boards, was upset, and its contents&mdash;bottles,
jugs, glasses, and bowls were broken and scattered
about in all directions. Everything proclaimed
the mischievous propensities of the
recent occupants of the chamber.</p>
<p><pp>Here lay a heap of knockers of all sizes,
from the huge lion's head to the small brass</pp>
<pb n="28">
<pp>rapper: there, a collection of sign&hyphen;boards,
with the names and calling of the owners
utterly obliterated. On this side stood the
instruments with which the latter piece of
pleasantry had been effected,&mdash;namely, a bucket
filled with paint and a brush: on that was
erected a trophy, consisting of a watchman's
rattle, a laced hat, with the crown knocked
out, and its place supplied by a lantern, a campaign
wig saturated with punch, a torn steenkirk
and ruffles, some half&hyphen;dozen staves, and
a broken sword.</pp></p>
<p><pp>As the carpenter's gaze wandered over this
scene of devastation, his attention was drawn
by Mrs. Sheppard towards an appalling object
in one corner. This was the body of a man,
apparently lifeless, and stretched upon a mattress,
with his head bound up in a linen cloth,
through which the blood had oosed. Near the
body, which, it will be surmised, was that of
Abraham Mendez, two ruffianly personages were
seated, quietly smoking, and bestowing no sort
of attention upon the new&hyphen;comers. Their conversation
was conducted in the flash language,
and, though unintelligible to Wood, was easily</pp>
<pb n="29">
<pp>comprehended by his companion, who learnt,
to her dismay, that the wounded man had
received his hurt from her son, whose courage
and dexterity formed the present subject of
their discourse. From other obscure hints
dropped by the speakers, Mrs. Sheppard ascertained
that Thames Darrell had been carried
off&mdash;where she could not make out&mdash;by
Jonathan Wild and Quilt Arnold; and that
Jack had been induced to accompany Blueskin
to the Mint. This intelligence, which she instantly
communicated to the carpenter, drove
him almost frantic. He renewed his supplications
to Sharples, but with no better success
than heretofore; and the greater part of the
night was passed by him and the poor widow,
whose anxiety, if possible, exceeded his own,
in the most miserable state imaginable.</pp></p>
<p><pp>At length, about three o'clock, as the first
glimmer of dawn became visible through the
barred casements of the roundhouse, the rattling
of bolts and chains at the outer door told
that some one was admitted. Whoever this
might be, the visit seemed to have some reference
to the carpenter, for, shortly afterwards,</pp>
<pb n="30">
<pp>Sharples made his appearance, and informed
the captives they were free. Without waiting
to have the information repeated, Wood
rushed forth, determined as soon as he could
procure assistance, to proceed to Jonathan
Wild's house in the Old Bailey; while Mrs.
Sheppard, whose maternal fears drew her in
another direction, hurried off to the Mint.</pp></p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>In</smallcap> an incredibly short space of time,&mdash;for
her anxiety lent wings to her feet,&mdash;Mrs. Sheppard
reached the debtors' garrison. From a
scout stationed at the northern entrance, whom
she addressed in the jargon of the place, with
which long usage had formerly rendered her
familiar, she ascertained that Blueskin, accompanied
by a youth, whom she knew by the
description must be her son, had arrived there
about three hours before, and had proceeded to
the Cross Shovels. This was enough for the
poor widow. She felt she was now near her
boy, and, nothing doubting her ability to rescue
him from his perilous situation, she
breathed a fervent prayer for his deliverance; 
and, bending her steps towards the tavern in
question, revolved within her mind as she
walked along the best means of accomplishing</pp>
<pb n="32">
<pp>her purpose. Aware of the cunning and
desperate characters of the persons with whom
she would have to deal,&mdash;aware, also, that she
was in a quarter where no laws could be appealed
to, nor assistance obtained, she felt
the absolute necessity of caution. Accordingly,
when she arrived at the Shovels, with
which, as an old haunt in her bygone days of
wretchedness she was well acquainted, instead
of entering the principal apartment, which she
saw at a glance was crowded with company of
both sexes, she turned into a small room on
the left of the bar, and, as an excuse for so
doing, called for something to drink. The
drawers at the moment were too busy to attend
to her, and she would have seized the
opportunity of examining, unperceived, the assemblage
within, through a little curtained
window that overlooked the adjoining chamber,
if an impediment had not existed in the
shape of Baptist Kettleby, whose portly person
entirely obscured the view. The Master of
the Mint, in the exercise of his two&hyphen;fold
office of governor and publican, was mounted
upon a chair, and holding forth to his guests</pp>
<pb n="33">
<pp>in a speech, to which Mrs. Sheppard was unwillingly
compelled to listen.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of the Mint,&rdquo; said the orator,
&ldquo;when I was first called, some fifty years ago,
to the important office I hold, there existed
across the water three places of refuge for the
oppressed and persecuted debtor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know it,&rdquo; cried several voices.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It happened, gentlemen,&rdquo; pursued the
Master, &ldquo;on a particular occasion, about the
time I've mentioned, that the Archduke of
Alsatia, the Sovereign of the Savoy, and the Satrap
of Salisbury Court, met by accident at the
Cross Shovels. A jolly night we made of it,
as you may suppose; for four such monarchs
don't often come together. Well, while we
were smoking our pipes, and quaffing our
punch, Alsatia turns to me and says, &lsquo;Mint,&rsquo; 
says he, &lsquo;you're well off here.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Pretty well,&rsquo; 
says I; &lsquo;you're not badly off at the Friars,
for that matter.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! yes we are,&rsquo; says he.&mdash; 
&lsquo;How so?&rsquo; says I.&mdash;&lsquo;It's all up with us,&rsquo; says
he; &lsquo;they've taken away our charter.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;They
can't,&rsquo; says I.&mdash;&lsquo;They have,&rsquo; says he.&mdash;&lsquo;They
can't, I tell you,&rsquo; says I, in a bit of a passion;</pp>
<pb n="34">
<pp>&lsquo;its unconstitutional.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Unconstitutional or
not,&rsquo; says Salisbury Court and Savoy, speaking
together, &lsquo;it's true. We shall become a prey
to the Philistines, and must turn honest in
self&hyphen;defence.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No fear o'that,&rsquo;thought I.&mdash;&lsquo;I
see how it'll be,&rsquo; observed Alsatia, &lsquo;everybody'll
pay his debts, and only think of such
a state of things as that.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It's <it>not</it> to be
thought of,&rsquo; says I, thumping the table till
every glass on it jingled; &lsquo;and I know a way
as'll prevent it.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What is it, Mint?&rsquo; asked
all three.&mdash;&lsquo;Why, hang every bailiff that sets
a foot in your territories, and you're safe,&rsquo; 
says I.&mdash;&lsquo;We'll do it,&rsquo; said they, filling their
glasses, and looking as fierce as King George's
grenadier guards; &lsquo;here's your health, Mint.&rsquo; 
But, gentlemen, though they talked so largely,
and looked so fiercely, they did <it>not</it> do it; they
did <it>not</it> hang the bailiffs; and where are they?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, where are they?&rdquo; echoed the company,
with indignant derision.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; returned the Master, solemnly,
&ldquo;it is a question easily answered&mdash; 
they are NOWHERE! Had they hanged the
bailiffs, the bailiffs would not have hanged</pp>
<pb n="35">
<pp>them. We ourselves have been similarly
circumstanced. Attacked by an infamous and
unconstitutional statute, passed in the reign
of the late usurper, William of Orange, (for
I may remark that, if the right king had been
upon the throne, that illegal enactment would
never have received the royal assent&mdash;the
Stuarts&mdash;Heaven preserve'em!&mdash;always siding
with the debtors); attacked in this outrageous
manner, I repeat, it has been all but &lsquo;<it>up</it>&rsquo; with
us! But the vigorous resistance offered on
that memorable occasion by the patriotic inhabitants
of Bermuda to the aggressions of
arbitrary power, secured and established their
privileges on a firmer basis than heretofore; 
and, while their pusillanimous allies were
crushed and annihilated, they became more
prosperous than ever. Gentlemen, I am proud
to say that <it>I</it> originated&mdash;that <it>I</it> directed
those
measures. I hope to see the day, when not
Southwark alone, but London itself shall become
one Mint,&mdash;when all men shall be
debtors, and none creditors,&mdash;when imprisonment
for debt shall be utterly abolished,&mdash;when
highway&hyphen;robbery shall be accounted a pleasant</pp>
<pb n="36">
<pp>pastime, and forgery an accomplishment,&mdash; 
when Tyburn and its gibbets shall be overthrown,
&mdash;capital punishments discontinued,&mdash; 
Newgate, Ludgate, the Gatehouse, and the
Compters razed to the ground,&mdash;Bridewell and
Clerkenwell destroyed,&mdash;the Fleet, the King's
Bench, and the Marshalsea remembered only
by name! But in the mean time, as that day
may possibly be farther off than I anticipate,
we are bound to make the most of the present.
Take care of yourselves, gentlemen, and your
governor will take care of you. Before I sit
down, I have a toast to propose, which I am
sure will be received, as it deserves to be, with
enthusiasm. It is the health of a stranger,&mdash; 
of Mr. John Sheppard. His father was one
of my old customers, and I am happy to find
his son treading in his steps. He couldn't be
in better hands than those in which he has
placed himself. Gentlemen,&mdash;Mr. Sheppard's
good health, and success to him!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>Baptist's toast was received with loud applause,
and, as he sat down amid the cheers
of the company, and a universal clatter of
mugs and glasses, the widow's view was no</pp>
<pb n="37">
<pp>longer obstructed. Her eye wandered quickly
over that riotous and disorderly assemblage,
until it settled upon one group more riotous
and disorderly than the rest, of which her son
formed the principal figure. The agonized
mother could scarcely repress a scream at the
spectacle that met her gaze. There sat Jack,
evidently in the last stage of intoxication, with
his collar opened, his dress disarranged, a pipe
in his mouth, a bowl of punch and a halfemptied
rummer before him,&mdash;there he sat,
receiving and returning, or rather attempting
to return,&mdash;for he was almost past consciousness,
&mdash;the blandishments of a couple of
females, one of whom had passed her arm
round his neck, while the other leaned over
the back of his chair, and appeared from her
gestures to be whispering soft nonsense into
his ear.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Both these ladies possessed considerable
personal attractions. The younger of the two,
who was seated next to Jack, and seemed to
monopolize his attention, could not be more
than seventeen, though her person had all the
maturity of twenty. She had delicate oval</pp>
<pb n="38">
<pp>features, light, laughing blue eyes, a pretty
<it>nez retrouss&eacute;</it>, (why have we not the term,
since we have the best specimens of the feature?)
teeth of pearly whiteness, and a brilliant
complexion, set off by rich auburn hair,
a very white neck and shoulders,&mdash;the latter,
perhaps, a trifle too much exposed. The name
of this damsel was Edgeworth Bess; and, as
her fascinations will not, perhaps, be found to
be without some influence upon the future
fortunes of her boyish admirer, we have
thought it worth while to be thus particular
in describing them. The other <it>bona roba</it>,
known amongst her companions as Mistress
Poll Maggot, was a beauty on a much larger
scale,&mdash;in fact, a perfect Amazon. Nevertheless,
though nearly six feet high, and correspondingly
proportioned, she was a model of
symmetry, and boasted, with the frame of a
Thalestris or a Trulla, the regular lineaments
of the Medicean Venus. A man's laced hat,
&mdash;whether adopted from the caprice of the
moment, or habitually worn, we are unable to
state,&mdash;cocked knowingly on her head, harmonized
with her masculine appearance. Mrs.</pp>
<pb n="39">
<pp>Maggot, as well as her companion Edgeworth
Bess, was showily dressed; nor did either of
them disdain the aid supposed to be lent to a
fair skin by the contents of the patchbox.
On an empty cask, which served him for a
chair, and opposite Jack Sheppard, whose
rapid progress in depravity afforded him the
highest satisfaction, sat Blueskin, encouraging
the two women in their odious task, and plying
his victim with the glass as often as he
deemed it expedient to do so. By this time,
he had apparently accomplished all he desired; 
for moving the bottle out of Jack's reach, he
appropriated it entirely to his own use, leaving
the devoted lad to the care of the females.
Some few of the individuals seated at the
other tables seemed to take an interest in the
proceedings of Blueskin and his party, just as
a by&hyphen;stander watches any other game; but,
generally speaking, the company were too
much occupied with their own concerns to
pay attention to anything else. The assemblage
was for the most part, if not altogether,
composed of persons to whom vice in all its
aspects was too familiar to present much of</pp>
<pb n="40">
<pp>novelty, in whatever form it was exhibited.
Nor was Jack by any means the only stripling
in the room. Not far from him was a knot
of lads drinking, swearing, and playing at dice
as eagerly and as skilfully as any of the older
hands. Near to these hopeful youths sat a
fence, or receiver, bargaining with a clouter,
or pickpocket, for a <it>suit</it>,&mdash;or, to speak in
more intelligible language, a watch and seals,
two <it>cloaks</it>, commonly called watch&hyphen;cases, and
a <it>wedge&hyphen;lobb</it>, otherwise known as a silver
snuff&hyphen;box. Next to the receiver was a gang
of housebreakers, laughing over their exploits,
and planning fresh depredations; and next to
the housebreakers came two gallant&hyphen;looking
gentlemen in long periwigs and riding&hyphen;dresses,
and equipped in all other respects for the road,
with a roast fowl and a bottle of wine before
them. Amid this varied throng,&mdash;varied in
appearance, but alike in character,&mdash;one object
alone, we have said, rivetted Mrs. Sheppard's
attention; and no sooner did she in
some degree recover from the shock occasioned
by the sight of her son's debased condition,
than, regardless of any other consideration except</pp>
<pb n="41">
<pp>his instant removal from the contaminating
society by which he was surrounded,
and utterly forgetting the more cautious plan
she meant to have adopted, she rushed into
the room, and summoned him to follow
her.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; cried Jack, looking round, and
trying to fix his inebriate gaze upon the
speaker,&mdash;&ldquo;who's that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard.
&ldquo;Come home directly, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother be&wblank;!&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;Who
is it, Bess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; replied Edgeworth
Bess. &ldquo;But if it <it>is</it> your mother, send her
about her business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;in the twinkling
of a bed&hyphen;post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you once more in the Mint,
Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; roared Blueskin, who anticipated
some fun. &ldquo;Come and sit down by
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a glass of gin, ma'am,&rdquo; cried Poll
Maggot, holding up a bottle of spirit; &ldquo;it
used to be your favourite liquor, I've
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="42">
<p>&ldquo;Jack, my love,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard,
disregarding the taunt, &ldquo;come away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;I'm too comfortable
where I am. Be off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed his unhappy parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheppard, if you please, ma'am,&rdquo; interrupted
the lad; &ldquo;I allow nobody to call me
Jack. Do I, Bess, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody whatever, love,&rdquo; replied Edgeworth
Bess; &ldquo;nobody but me, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me,&rdquo; insinuated Mrs. Maggot. &ldquo;My
little fancy man's quite as fond of me as of
you, Bess. Ain't you, Jacky darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite, Poll,&rdquo; returned Mr. Sheppard; 
&ldquo;but I love you next to her, and both of you
better than <it>her</it>,&rdquo; pointing with the pipe to his
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; shouted Blueskin. &ldquo;Tom Sheppard
never said a better thing than that&mdash;ho!
ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; cried his mother, wringing her
hands in distraction, &ldquo;you'll break my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poh! poh!&rdquo; returned her son; &ldquo;women
don't so easily break their hearts. Do they,
Bess?&rdquo;</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>351Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010113">
<pb n="43">
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the young lady
appealed to, &ldquo;especially about their sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; retorted Edgeworth Bess, with a
very unfeminine imprecation, &ldquo;I shan't stand
any more of that nonsense. What do you
mean by calling me wretch, madam?&rdquo; she
added, marching up to Mrs. Sheppard, and regarding
her with an insolent and threatening
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what do you mean, ma'am?&rdquo; added
Jack, staggering after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, my love, come&mdash;come,&rdquo; 
cried his mother, seizing his hand, and endeavouring
to force him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shan't go,&rdquo; cried Edgeworth Bess,
holding him by the other hand. &ldquo;Here, Poll,
help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Thus exhorted, Mrs. Maggot lent her powerful
aid, and, between the two, Jack was
speedily relieved from all fears of being carried
off against his will. Not content with this exhibition
of her prowess, the Amazon lifted him
up as easily as if he had been an infant, and
placed him upon her shoulders, to the infinite</pp>
<pb n="44">
<pp>delight of the company, and the increased distress
of his mother.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let's see who'll dare to take him
down,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody shall,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sheppard from
his elevated position. &ldquo;I'm my own master
now, and I'll do as I please. I'll turn cracksman,
like my father&mdash;rob old Wood&mdash;he has
chests full of money, and I know where they're
kept&mdash;I'll rob him, and give the swag to you,
Poll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>Jack would have said more; but, losing his
balance, he fell to the ground, and, when taken
up, he was perfectly insensible. In this state,
he was laid upon a bench, to sleep off his
drunken fit, while his wretched mother, in
spite of her passionate supplications and resistance,
was, by Blueskin's command, forcibly
ejected from the house, and driven out of the
Mint.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>During</smallcap> the whole of the next day and
night, the poor widow hovered like a ghost
about the precincts of the debtors' garrison,&mdash; 
for admission (by the Master's express orders,)
was denied her. She could learn nothing of
her son, and only obtained one solitary piece of
information, which added to, rather than alleviated
her misery,&mdash;namely, that Jonathan
Wild had paid a secret visit to the Cross Shovels.
At one time, she determined to go to
Wych Street, and ask Mr. Wood's advice and
assistance, but the thought of the reception she
was likely to meet with from his wife deterred
her from executing this resolution.
Many other expedients occurred to her; but
after making several ineffectual attempts to
get into the Mint unobserved, they were all
abandoned.</p>
<pb n="46">
<p>At length, about an hour before dawn on the
second day&mdash;Sunday&mdash;having spent the early
part of the night in watching at the gates of the
robber's sanctuary, and being almost exhausted
from want of rest, she set out homewards. It
was a long walk she had to undertake, even if
she had endured no previous fatigue, but feeble
as she was, it was almost more than she could
accomplish. Daybreak found her winding her
painful way along the Harrow Road; and, in
order to shorten the distance as much as possible,
she took the nearest cut, and struck into
the meadows on the right. Crossing several
fields, newly mown, or filled with lines of tedded
hay, she arrived, not without great exertion,
at the summit of a hill. Here her strength
completely failed her, and she was compelled
to seek some repose. Making her couch upon
a heap of hay, she sank at once into a deep
and refreshing slumber.</p>
<p><pp>
When she awoke, the sun was high in heaven.
It was a bright and beautiful day: <it>so</it>
bright, <it>so</it> beautiful, that even her sad heart
was cheered by it. The air, perfumed with
the delicious fragrance of the new&hyphen;mown grass,</pp>
<pb n="47">
<pp>was vocal with the melodies of the birds; the
thick foliage of the trees was glistening in the
sunshine; all nature seemed happy and rejoicing; 
but, above all, the serene Sabbath
stillness reigning around, communicated a calm
to her wounded spirit.</pp></p>
<p>What a contrast did the lovely scene she
now gazed upon present to the squalid neighbourhood
she had recently quitted! On all
sides, expanded prospects of country the most
exquisite and most varied. Immediately beneath
her lay Willesden,&mdash;the most charming
and secluded village in the neighbourhood of
the metropolis&mdash;with its scattered farm&hyphen;houses,
its noble granges, and its old grey church tower
just peeping above a grove of rook&hyphen;haunted
trees.</p>
<p>Towards this spot Mrs. Sheppard now directed
her steps. She speedily reached her
own abode,&mdash;a little cottage, standing in the
outskirts of the village. The first circumstance
that struck her on her arrival seemed ominous.
Her clock had stopped&mdash;stopped at the very
hour on which she had quitted the Mint! She
had not the heart to wind it up again.</p>
<pb n="48">
<p>After partaking of some little refreshment,
and changing her attire, Mrs. Sheppard prepared
for church. By this time, she had so far
succeeded in calming herself, that she answered
the greetings of the neighbours whom she encountered
on her way to the sacred edifice&mdash;if
sorrowfully, still composedly.</p>
<p>Every old country church is beautiful, but
Willesden is the most beautiful country church
we know; and in Mrs. Sheppard's time it was
even more beautiful than at present, when the
hand of improvement has proceeded a little too
rashly with alterations and repairs. With one
or two exceptions, there were no pews; and,
as the intercourse with London was then but
slight, the seats were occupied almost exclusively
by the villagers. In one of these seats,
at the end of the aisle farthest removed from
the chancel, the widow took her place, and
addressed herself fervently to her devotions.</p>
<p><pp>The service had not proceeded far, when she
was greatly disturbed by the entrance of a person
who placed himself opposite her, and
sought to attract her attention by a number of
little arts, surveying her, as he did so, with a</pp>
<pb n="49">
<pp>very impudent and offensive stare. With this
person&mdash;who was no other than Mr. Kneebone
&mdash;she was too well acquainted; having, more
than once, been obliged to repel his advances; 
and, though his impertinence would have given
her little concern at another season, it now
added considerably to her distraction. But a
far greater affliction was in store for her.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Just as the clergyman approached the altar,
she perceived a boy steal quickly into the
church, and ensconce himself behind the
woollen&hyphen;draper, who, in order to carry on his
amatory pursuits with greater convenience,
and at the same time display his figure (of
which he was not a little vain) to the utmost
advantage, preferred a standing to a sitting
posture. Of this boy she had only caught
a glimpse;&mdash;but that glimpse was sufficient to
satisfy her it was her son,&mdash;and, if she could
have questioned her own instinctive love, she
could not question her antipathy, when she
beheld, partly concealed by a pillar immediately
in the rear of the woollen&hyphen;draper, the dark
figure and trucculent features of Jonathan
Wild. As she looked in this direction, the</pp>
<pb n="50">
<pp>thief&hyphen;taker raised his eyes&mdash;those grey, bloodthirsty
eyes!&mdash;their glare froze the life&hyphen;blood
in her veins.</pp></p>
<p>As she averted her gaze, a terrible idea
crossed her. Why was he there? why did the
tempter dare to invade that sacred spot? She
could not answer her own questions, but vague
fearful suspicions passed through her mind.
Meanwhile, the service proceeded; and the
awful command, &ldquo;<it>Thou shalt not steal</it>!&rdquo; was
solemnly uttered by the preacher, when Mrs.
Sheppard, who had again looked round towards
her son, beheld a hand glance along the
side of the woollen&hyphen;draper. She could not see
what occurred, though she guessed it; but she
saw Jonathan's devilish triumphing glance,
and read in it,&mdash;&ldquo;Your son has committed a
robbery&mdash;here&mdash;in these holy walls&mdash;he is
mine&mdash;mine for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She uttered a loud scream, and fainted.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Just</smallcap> as St. Sepulchre's church struck one,
on the eventful night of the 10th of June, (to
which it will not be necessary to recur,) a
horseman, mounted on a powerful charger,
and followed at a respectful distance by an
attendant, galloped into the open space fronting
Newgate, and directed his course towards
a house in the Old Bailey. Before he could
draw in the rein, his steed&mdash;startled apparently
by some object undistinguishable by
the rider,&mdash;swerved with such suddenness as
to unseat him, and precipitate him on the
ground. The next moment, however, he was
picked up, and set upon his feet by a person
who, having witnessed the accident, flew across
the road to his assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're not hurt, I hope, Sir Rowland?&rdquo; 
inquired this individual.</p>
<pb n="52">
<p>&ldquo;Not materially, Mr. Wild,&rdquo; replied the
other, &ldquo;a little shaken, that's all. Curses
light on the horse!&rdquo; he added, seizing the
bridle of his steed, who continued snorting
and shivering, as if still under the influence
of some unaccountable alarm; &ldquo;what can ail
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>I</it> know what ails him, your honour,&rdquo; rejoined
the groom, riding up as he spoke; 
&ldquo;he's seen somethin' not o' this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely,&rdquo; observed Jonathan, with a
slight sneer; &ldquo;the ghost of some highwayman
who has just breathed his last in Newgate, no
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be,&rdquo; returned the man gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him home, Saunders,&rdquo; said Sir Rowland,
resigning his faulty steed to the attendant's
care, &ldquo;I shall not require you further.
Strange!&rdquo; he added, as the groom departed; 
&ldquo;Bay Stuart has carried me through a hundred
dangers, but never played me such a trick
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And never should again, were he mine,&rdquo; 
rejoined Jonathan. &ldquo;If the best nag ever
foaled were to throw me in this unlucky spot,
I'd blow his brains out.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="53">
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; asked Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fall against Newgate is accounted a sign
of death by the halter,&rdquo; replied Wild, with illdisguised
malignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Rowland, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that door,&rdquo; continued the thieftaker,
pointing to the gloomy portal of the prison
opposite which they were standing, &ldquo;the condemned
are taken to Tyburn. It's a bad
omen to be thrown near that door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't suspect you of so much superstition,
Mr Wild,&rdquo; observed the knight, contemptuously.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Facts convince the most incredulous,&rdquo; 
answered Jonathan, drily. &ldquo;I've known several
cases where the ignominious doom I've
mentioned has been foretold by such an accident
as has just befallen you. There was
Major Price&mdash;you must recollect him, Sir
Rowland,&mdash;he stumbled as he was getting out
of his chair at that very gate. Well, <it>he</it> was
executed for murder. Then there was Tom
Jarrot, the hackney&hyphen;coachman, who was pitched
off the box against yonder curbstone, and broke</pp>
<pb n="54">
<pp>his leg. It was a pity he didn't break his
neck, for he was hanged within the year.
Another instance was that of Toby Tanner&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;No more of this,&rdquo; interrupted Trenchard; 
&ldquo;where is the boy?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far hence,&rdquo; replied Wild. &ldquo;After
all our pains we were near losing him, Sir
Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so,&rdquo; asked the other, distrustfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall hear,&rdquo; returned Jonathan.
&ldquo;With the help of his comrade, Jack Sheppard,
the young rascal made a bold push to
get out of the roundhouse, where my janizaries
had lodged him, and would have succeeded
too, if, by good luck,&mdash;for the devil never
deserts so useful an agent as I am, Sir Rowland,
&mdash;I hadn't arrived in time to prevent
him. As it was, my oldest and trustiest setter,
Abraham Mendez, received a blow on the
head from one of the lads that will deprive
me of his services for a week to come,&mdash;if,
indeed it does not disable him altogether.
However, if I've lost one servant, I've gained
another, that's one comfort. Jack Sheppard
is now wholly in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="55">
<p>&ldquo;What is this to me, sir?&rdquo; said Trenchard,
cutting him short.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; rejoined the thieftaker,
coldly. &ldquo;But it is much to me. Jack
Sheppard is to me what Thames Darrell is
to you&mdash;an object of hatred. I owed his father
a grudge: that I settled long ago. I owe his
mother one, and will repay the debt, with interest,
to her son. I could make away with
him at once, as you are about to make away
with your nephew, Sir Rowland,&mdash;but that
wouldn't serve my turn. To be complete, my
vengeance must be tardy. Certain of my prey,
I can afford to wait for it. Besides, revenge
is sweetened by delay; and I indulge too freely
in the passion to rob it of any of its zest. I've
watched this lad&mdash;this Sheppard&mdash;from infancy; 
and, though I have apparently concerned
myself little about him, I have never
lost sight of my purpose. I have suffered him
to be brought up decently&mdash;honestly; because
I would make his fall the greater, and deepen
the wound I meant to inflict upon his mother.
From this night I shall pursue a different
course; from this night his ruin may be dated.</pp>
<pb n="56">
<pp>He is in the care of those who will not leave
the task assigned to them&mdash;the utter perversion
of his principles&mdash;half&hyphen;finished. And when
I have steeped him to the lips in vice and depravity; 
when I have led him to the commission
of every crime; when there is neither
retreat nor advance for him; when he has
plundered his benefactor, and broken the heart
of his mother&mdash;then&mdash;but not till then, I will
consign him to the fate to which I consigned
his father. This I have sworn to do&mdash;this I
will do.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless your skull's bullet&hyphen;proof,&rdquo; 
cried a voice at his elbow; and, as the words
were uttered, a pistol was snapped at his head,
which,&mdash;fortunately or unfortunately, as the
reader pleases,&mdash;only burnt the priming. The
blaze, however, was sufficient to reveal to the
thieftaker the features of his intended assassin.
They were those of the Irish watchman.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Ah! Terry O'Flaherty!&rdquo; vociferated Jonathan,
in a tone that betrayed not the slightest
discomposure. &ldquo;Ah! Terry O'Flaherty!&rdquo; he
cried, shouting after the Irishman, who took
to his heels as soon as he found his murderous</pp>
<pb n="57">
<pp>attempt unsuccessful; &ldquo;you may run, but
you'll not get out of my reach. I'll put a
brace of dogs on your track, who'll soon hunt
you down. You shall swing for this after next
sessions, or my name's not Jonathan Wild.
I told you, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; he added, turning
to the knight, and chuckling, &ldquo;the devil never
deserts me.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Conduct me to your dwelling, sir, without
further delay,&rdquo; said Trenchard, sternly,&mdash; 
&ldquo;to the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy's not at my house,&rdquo; replied
Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo; demanded the other,
hastily.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;At a place we call the Dark House at
Queenhithe,&rdquo; answered Jonathan, &ldquo;a sort of
underground tavern or night&hyphen;cellar, close to
the river&hyphen;side, and frequented by the crew of
the Dutch skipper, to whose care he's to be
committed. You need have no apprehensions
about him, Sir Rowland. He's safe enough
now. I left him in charge of Quilt Arnold and
Rykhart Van Galgebrok&mdash;the skipper I spoke
of&mdash;with strict orders to shoot him if he made</pp>
<pb n="58">
<pp>any further attempt at escape; and they're not
lads&mdash;the latter especially&mdash;to be trifled with.
I deemed it more prudent to send him to the
Dark House than to bring him here, in case of
any search after him by his adoptive father&mdash; 
the carpenter Wood. If you choose, you can
see him put on board the Zeeslang yourself,
Sir Rowland. But, perhaps, you'll first accompany
me to my dwelling for a moment,
that we may arrange our accounts before we
start. I've a few necessary directions to leave
with my people, to put 'em on their guard
against the chance of a surprise. Suffer me to
precede you. This way, Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>The thieftaker's residence was a large dismal&hyphen;looking
habitation, separated from the street
by a flagged court&hyphen;yard, and defended from
general approach by an iron railing. Even in
the daylight, it had a sombre and suspicious
air, and seemed to slink back from the adjoining
houses, as if afraid of their society. In
the obscurity in which it was now seen, it
looked like a prison, and, indeed, it was Jonathan's
fancy to make it resemble one as much
as possible. The windows were grated, the</pp>
<pb n="59">
<pp>doors barred; each room had the name as well
as the appearance of a cell; and the very porter
who stood at the gate, habited like a gaoler,
with his huge bunch of keys at his girdle, his
forbidding countenance and surly demeanour
seemed to be borrowed from Newgate. The
clanking of chains, the grating of locks, and the
rumbling of bolts must have been music in
Jonathan's ears, so much pains did he take to
subject himself to such sounds. The scanty
furniture of the rooms corresponded with their
dungeon&hyphen;like aspect. The walls were bare,
and painted in stone&hyphen;colour; the floors, devoid
of carpet; the beds, of hangings; the windows,
of blinds; and, excepting in the thieftaker's
own audience&hyphen;chamber, there was not a chair
or a table about the premises; the place of
these conveniences being elsewhere supplied by
benches, and deal&hyphen;boards laid across joint&hyphen;stools.
Great stone staircases leading no one
knew whither, and long gloomy passages, impressed
the occasional visiter with the idea that
he was traversing a building of vast extent; 
and, though this was not the case in reality
the deception was so cleverly contrived that</pp>
<pb n="60">
<pp>it seldom failed of producing the intended effect.
Scarcely any one entered Mr. Wild's
dwelling without apprehension, or quitted it
without satisfaction. More strange stories
were told of it than of any other house in London.
The garrets were said to be tenanted by
coiners, and artists employed in altering
watches and jewelry; the cellars to be used as
a magazine for stolen goods. By some it was
affirmed that a subterranean communication
existed between the thieftaker's abode and
Newgate, by means of which he was enabled to
maintain a secret correspondence with the imprisoned
felons: by others, that an underground
passage led to extensive vaults, where
such malefactors as he chose to screen from
justice might lie concealed till the danger was
blown over. Nothing, in short, was too extravagant
to be related of it; and Jonathan, who
delighted in investing himself and his residence
with mystery, encouraged, and perhaps originated,
these marvellous tales. However this
may be, such was the ill report of the place
that few passed along the Old Bailey without
bestowing a glance of fearful curiosity at its</pp>
<pb n="61">
<pp>dingy walls, and wondering what was going on
inside them; while fewer still, of those who
paused at the door, read, without some internal
trepidation, the formidable name&mdash;inscribed
in large letters on its bright brass&hyphen;plate
&mdash;of JONATHAN WILD.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Arrived at his habitation, Jonathan knocked
in a peculiar manner at the door, which was
instantly opened by the grim&hyphen;visaged porter
just alluded to. No sooner had Trenchard
crossed the threshold than a fierce barking was
heard at the farther extremity of the passage,
and, the next moment, a couple of mastiffs of
the largest size rushed furiously towards him.
The knight stood upon his defence; but he
would unquestionably have been torn in pieces
by the savage hounds, if a shower of oaths, seconded
by a vigorous application of kicks and
blows from their master, had not driven them
growling off. Apologizing to Sir Rowland for
this unpleasant reception, and swearing lustily
at his servant for occasioning it by leaving the
dogs at liberty, Jonathan ordered the man to
light them to the audience&hyphen;room. The command
was sullenly obeyed, for the fellow did</pp>
<pb n="62">
<pp>not appear to relish the rating. Ascending the
stairs, and conducting them along a sombre
gallery, in which Trenchard noticed that every
door was painted black, and numbered, he
stopped at the entrance of a chamber; and,
selecting a key from the bunch at his girdle,
unlocked it. Following his guide, Sir Rowland
found himself in a large and lofty apartment,
the extent of which he could not entirely
discern until lights were set upon the table.
He then looked around him with some curiosity; 
and, as the thieftaker was occupied in
giving directions to his attendant in an undertone,
ample leisure was allowed him for investigation.
At the first glance, he imagined he
must have stumbled upon a museum of rarities,
there were so many glass cases, so many
open cabinets, ranged against the walls; but
the next convinced him that if Jonathan was a
virtuoso, his tastes did not run in the ordinary
channels. Trenchard was tempted to examine
the contents of some of these cases, but a closer
inspection made him recoil from them in disgust.
In the one he approached was gathered
together a vast assortment of weapons, each of</pp>
<pb n="63">
<pp>which, as appeared from the ticket attached to
it, had been used as an instrument of destruction.
On this side was a razor with which a
son had murdered his father; the blade
notched, the haft crusted with blood: on that,
a bar of iron, bent, and partly broken, with
which a husband had beaten out his wife's
brains. As it is not, however, our intention to
furnish a complete catalogue of these curiosities,
we shall merely mention that in front of
them lay a large and sharp knife, once the property
of the public executioner, and used by
him to dissever the limbs of those condemned
to death for high&hyphen;treason; together with an
immense two&hyphen;pronged flesh&hyphen;fork, likewise employed
by the same terrible functionary to
plunge the quarters of his victims in the caldrons
of boiling tar and oil. Every gibbet at
Tyburn and Hounslow appeared to have been
plundered of its charnel spoil to enrich the
adjoining cabinet, so well was it stored with
skulls and bones, all purporting to be the relics
of highwaymen famous in their day. Halters,
each of which had fulfilled its destiny, formed
the attraction of the next compartment; while</pp>
<pb n="64">
<pp>a fourth was occupied by an array of implements
of housebreaking almost innumerable,
and utterly indescribable. All these interesting
objects were carefully arranged, classed, and,
as we have said, labelled by the thieftaker.</pp></p>
<p>From this singular collection Trenchard
turned to regard its possessor, who was standing
at a little distance from him, still engaged
in earnest discourse with his attendant, and, as
he contemplated his ruthless countenance, on
which duplicity and malignity had set their
strongest seals, he could not help calling to
mind all he had heard of Jonathan's perfidiousness
to his employers, and deeply regretting
that he had placed himself in the power of so
unscrupulous a miscreant.</p>
<p><pp>Jonathan Wild, at this time, was on the
high&hyphen;road to the greatness which he subsequently,
and not long afterwards, obtained. He was
fast rising to an eminence that no one of his
nefarious profession ever reached before him,
nor, it is to be hoped, will ever reach again.
He was the Napoleon of knavery, and established
an uncontrolled empire over all the
practitioners of crime. This was no light conquest;</pp>
<pb n="65">
<pp>nor was it a government easily maintained.
Resolution, severity, subtlety, were
required for it; and these were qualities which
Jonathan possessed in an extraordinary degree.
The danger or difficulty of an exploit never
appalled him. What his head conceived his
hand executed. Professing to stand between
the robber and the robbed, he himself plundered
both. He it was who formed the grand
design of a robber corporation, of which he
should be the sole head and director, with the
right of delivering those who concealed their
booty, or refused to share it with him, to the
gallows. He divided London into districts; 
appointed a gang to each district; and a leader
to each gang, whom he held responsible to
himself. The country was partitioned in a similar
manner. Those whom he retained about
his person, or placed in offices of trust, were
for the most part convicted felons, who, having
returned from transportation before their term
had expired, constituted, in his opinion, the
safest agents, inasmuch as they could neither
be legal evidences against him, nor withhold
any portion of the spoil of which he chose to</pp>
<pb n="66">
<pp>deprive them. But the crowning glory of
Jonathan, that which raised him above all his
predecessors in iniquity, and clothed his name
with undying notoriety&mdash;was to come. When
in the plenitude of his power, he commenced a
terrible trade, till then unknown&mdash;namely, a
traffic in human blood. This he carried on by
procuring witnesses to swear away the lives of
those persons who had incurred his displeasure,
or whom it might be necessary to remove.</pp></p>
<p>No wonder that Trenchard, as he gazed at
this fearful being, should have some misgivings
cross him.</p>
<p>Apparently, Jonathan perceived he was an
object of scrutiny; for, hastily dismissing his
attendant, he walked towards the knight.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;So, you're admiring my cabinet, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
he remarked, with a sinister smile; &ldquo;it
<it>is</it> generally admired; and, sometimes by parties
who afterwards contribute to the collection
themselves,&mdash;ha! ha! This skull,&rdquo; he added,
pointing to a fragment of mortality in the case
beside them, &ldquo;once belonged to Tom Sheppard,
the father of the lad I spoke of just now.</pp>
<pb n="67">
<pp>In the next box hangs the rope by which he
suffered. When I've placed another skull and
another halter beside them, I shall be contented.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;To business, sir!&rdquo; said the knight, with a
look of abhorrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, to business,&rdquo; returned Jonathan,
grinning, &ldquo;the sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the sum you bargained for,&rdquo; rejoined
Trenchard, flinging a pocket&hyphen;book on
the table; &ldquo;count it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan's eyes glistened as he told over
the notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've given me more than the amount,
Sir Rowland,&rdquo; he said, after he had twice
counted them, &ldquo;or I've missed my reckoning.
There's a hundred pounds too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it,&rdquo; said Trenchard, haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll place it to your account, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
answered the thieftaker, smiling significantly.
&ldquo;And now, shall we proceed to
Queenhithe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; cried the other, taking a chair,
&ldquo;a word with you, Mr. Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;As many as you please, Sir Rowland,&rdquo;</pp>
<pb n="68">
<pp>replied Jonathan, resuming his seat. &ldquo;I'm
quite at your disposal.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a question to propose to you,&rdquo; said
Trenchard, &ldquo;relating to&mdash;&rdquo; and he hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relating to the father of the boy&mdash;Thames
Darrell,&rdquo; supplied Jonathan. &ldquo;I guessed what
was coming. You desire to know who he was.
Sir Rowland. Well, you <it>shall</it> know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without further fee?&rdquo; inquired the
knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; answered Jonathan, drily.
&ldquo;A secret is too valuable a commodity to be
thrown away. But I said I wouldn't drive a
hard bargain with you, and I won't. We are
alone, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; he added, snuffing the
candles, glancing cautiously around, and lowering
his tone, &ldquo;and what you confide to me
shall never transpire,&mdash;at least to your disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at a loss to understand you sir,&rdquo; 
said Trenchard.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I'll make myself intelligible before I've
done,&rdquo; rejoined Wild. &ldquo;I need not remind
you, Sir Rowland, that I am aware you are</pp>
<pb n="69">
<pp>deeply implicated in the Jacobite plot which is
now known to be hatching.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; ejaculated the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, therefore,&rdquo; pursued Jonathan,
&ldquo;you are acquainted with all the leaders of
the proposed insurrection,&mdash;nay, must be in
correspondence with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right have you to suppose this,
sir?&rdquo; demanded Trenchard, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a moment's patience, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
returned Wild; &ldquo;and you shall hear. If you
will furnish me with a list of these rebels, and
with proofs of their treason, I will not only insure
your safety, but will acquaint you with
the real name and rank of your sister Aliva's
husband, as well as with some particulars which
will never otherwise reach your ears, concerning
your lost sister, Constance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister Constance!&rdquo; echoed the knight; 
&ldquo;what of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You agree to my proposal, then?&rdquo; said
Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for as great a villain as
yourself, sir?&rdquo; said the knight, rising.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I took you for one who wouldn't hesitate</pp>
<pb n="70">
<pp>to avail himself of any advantage chance might
throw in his way,&rdquo; returned the thieftaker,
coldly. &ldquo;I find I was in error. No matter.
A time <it>may</it> come,&mdash;and that ere long,&mdash;when
you will be glad to purchase my secrets, and
your own safety, at a dearer price than the
heads of your companions.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; said Trenchard, striding
towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, following him,
&ldquo;and so,&rdquo; he added in an undertone, &ldquo;are
your captors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment afterwards, they quitted the
house.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>After</smallcap> a few minutes&rsquo; rapid walking, during
which neither party uttered a word, Jonathan
Wild and his companion had passed Saint
Paul's, dived down a thoroughfare on the
right, and reached Thames&hyphen;street.</p>
<p><pp>At the period of this history, the main streets
of the metropolis were but imperfectly lighted,
while the less&hyphen;frequented avenues were left in
total obscurity; but, even at the present time,
the maze of courts and alleys into which Wild
now plunged, would have perplexed any one,
not familiar with their intricacies, to thread
them on a dark night. Jonathan, however,
was well acquainted with the road. Indeed,
it was his boast that he could find his way
through any part of London blindfolded; and
by this time, it would seem, he had nearly</pp>
<pb n="72">
<pp>arrived at his destination; for, grasping his
companion's arm, he led him along a narrow
entry which did not appear to have an outlet,
and came to a halt. Cautioning the knight, if
he valued his neck, to tread carefully, Jonathan
then descended a steep flight of steps; and,
having reached the bottom in safety, he pushed
open a door, that swung back on its hinges
as soon as it had admitted him; and, followed
by Trenchard, entered the night&hyphen;cellar.</pp></p>
<p>The vault, in which Sir Rowland found
himself, resembled in some measure the cabin
of a ship. It was long and narrow, with a
ceiling supported by huge uncovered rafters,
and so low as scarcely to allow a tall man like
himself to stand erect beneath it. Notwithstanding
the heat of the season,&mdash;which was
not, however, found particularly inconvenient
in this subterranean region,&mdash;a large heaped&hyphen;up
fire blazed ruddily in one corner, and lighted up
a circle of as villanous countenances as ever
flame shone upon.</p>
<p><pp>The guests congregated within the night&hyphen;cellar
were, in fact, little better than thieves; 
but thieves who confined their depredations</pp>
<pb n="73">
<pp>almost exclusively to the vessels lying in the
pool and docks of the river. They had as many
designations as grades. There were game
watermen and game lightermen, heavy horsemen
and light horsemen, scuffle&hyphen;hunters, and
long&hyphen;apron men, lumpers, journeymen coopers,
mud&hyphen;larks, badgers, and rat&hyphen;catchers&mdash;a race
of dangerous vermin recently, in a great measure,
extirpated by the vigilance of the Thames
Police, but at this period flourishing in vast
numbers. Besides these plunderers, there were
others with whom the disposal of their pillage
necessarily brought them into contact, and who
seldom failed to attend them during their hours
of relaxation and festivity;&mdash;to wit, dealers in
junk, old rags, and marine stores, purchasers
of prize&hyphen;money, crimps, and Jew receivers.
The latter formed by far the most knavishlooking
and unprepossessing portion of the
assemblage. One or two of the tables were
occupied by groups of fat frowzy women in flat
caps, with rings on their thumbs, and baskets
by their sides; and no one who had listened
for a single moment to their coarse language
and violent abuse of each other, would require</pp>
<pb n="74">
<pp>to be told they were fish&hyphen;wives from Billingsgate.</pp></p>
<p>The present divinity of the cellar was a
comely middle&hyphen;aged dame, almost as stout, and
quite as shrill&hyphen;voiced, as the Billingsgate fishwives
above&hyphen;mentioned. Mrs. Spurling, for so
was she named, had a warm nut&hyphen;brown complexion,
almost as dark as a Creole; and a
moustache on her upper lip, that would have
done no discredit to the oldest dragoon in the
King's service. This lady was singularly lucky
in her matrimonial connexions. She had been
married four times: three of her husbands died
of hempen fevers; and the fourth, having been
twice condemned, was saved from the noose by
Jonathan Wild, who not only managed to
bring him off, but to obtain for him the situation
of under&hyphen;turnkey in Newgate.</p>
<p><pp>On the appearance of the thieftaker, Mrs.
Spurling was standing near the fire superintending
some culinary preparation; but she no
sooner perceived him, than hastily quitting her
occupation, she elbowed a way for him and the
knight through the crowd, and ushered them,
with much ceremony, into an inner room,
where they found the objects of their search,</pp>
<pb n="75">
<pp>Quilt Arnold and Rykhart Van Galgebrok,
seated at a small table, quietly smoking. This
service rendered, without waiting for any farther
order, she withdrew.</pp></p>
<p>Both the janizary and the skipper arose as
the others entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the gentleman,&rdquo; observed Jonathan,
introducing Trenchard to the Hollander, &ldquo;who
is about to intrust his young relation to your
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De gentleman may rely on my showing his
relation all de attention in my power,&rdquo; replied
Van Galgebrok, bowing profoundly to the
knight; &ldquo;but if any unforseen accident&mdash;such
as a slip overboard&mdash;should befall de jonker on
de voyage, he mushn't lay de fault entirely on
my shoulders&mdash;haw! haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Sir Rowland, glancing
uneasily around. &ldquo;I do not see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De jonker. He's here,&rdquo; returned the skip
ker, pointing significantly downwards. &ldquo;Bring
him out, Quilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he pushed aside the table, and
the janizary stooping down, undrew a bolt and
opened a trap&hyphen;door.</p>
<pb n="76">
<p>&ldquo;Come out!&rdquo; roared Quilt, looking into the
aperture. &ldquo;You're wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as no answer was returned, he thrust
his arm up to the shoulder into the hole, and
with some little difficulty and exertion of
strength, drew forth Thames Darrell.</p>
<p>The poor boy, whose hands were pinioned
behind him, looked very pale, but neither
trembled, nor exhibited any other symptom of
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you come out when I called
you, you young dog?&rdquo; cried Quilt in a savage
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I knew what you wanted me for?&rdquo; 
answered Thames firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you did, did you?&rdquo; said the janizary.
&ldquo;And what do you suppose we mean to do
with you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to kill me,&rdquo; replied Thames,
&ldquo;by my cruel uncle's command. Ah! there
he stands!&rdquo; he exclaimed as his eye fell for the
first time upon Sir Rowland. &ldquo;Where is my
mother?&rdquo; he added, regarding the knight with
a searching glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother is dead,&rdquo; interposed Wild,
scowling.</p>
<pb n="77">
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; echoed the boy. &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;no!
You say this to terrify me&mdash;to try me. But I
will not believe you. Inhuman as he is, he
would not kill her. Tell me, sir,&rdquo; he added,
advancing towards the knight, &ldquo;tell me this
man has spoken falsely?&mdash;Tell me my mother
is alive, and do what you please with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him so, and have done with him, Sir
Rowland,&rdquo; observed Jonathan coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth, I implore you,&rdquo; cried
Thames. &ldquo;Is she alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not,&rdquo; replied Trenchard, overcome
by conflicting emotions, and unable to endure
the boy's agonized look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you answered?&rdquo; said Jonathan, with
a grin worthy of a demon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother!&mdash;my poor mother!&rdquo; ejaculated
Thames, falling on his knees, and bursting
into tears. &ldquo;Shall I never see that sweet
face again,&mdash;never feel the pressure of those
kind hands more&mdash;nor listen to that gentle
voice! Ah! yes, we shall meet again in heaven,
where I shall speedily join you. Now then,&rdquo; 
he added more calmly, &ldquo;I am ready to die.
The only mercy you can show me is to kill
me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="78">
<p>&ldquo;Then we won't even show you that mercy,&rdquo; 
retorted the thieftaker brutally. &ldquo;So get up,
and leave off whimpering. Your time isn't
come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wild,&rdquo; said Trenchard, &ldquo;I shall proceed
no further in this business. Set the boy
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I disobey you, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; replied
the thieftaker, &ldquo;you'll thank me for it hereafter.
Gag him,&rdquo; he added, pushing Thames
rudely toward Quilt Arnold, &ldquo;and convey him
to the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word,&rdquo; cried the boy, as the janizary
was preparing to obey his master's orders.
&ldquo;What has become of Jack Sheppard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil knows!&rdquo; answered Quilt; &ldquo;but I
believe he 's in the hands of Blueskin, so
there's no doubt he'll soon be on the highroad
to Tyburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Jack!&rdquo; sighed Thames. &ldquo;You
needn't gag me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I'll not cry
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won't trust you, my youngster,&rdquo; 
answered the janizary. And, thrusting a piece
of iron into his mouth, he forced him out of
the room.</p>
<pb n="79">
<p>Sir Rowland witnessed these proceedings
like one stupified. He neither attempted to
prevent his nephew's departure, nor to follow
him.</p>
<p>Jonathan kept his keen eye fixed upon him,
as he addressed himself for a moment to the
Hollander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the case of watches on board?&rdquo; he asked
in an under tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja,&rdquo; replied the skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the rings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's well. You must dispose of the
goldsmith's note I gave you yesterday, as soon
as you arrive at Rotterdam. It 'll be advertised
to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De duivel!&rdquo; exclaimed Van Galgebrok
&ldquo;Very well. It shall be done as you direct.
But about dat jonker,&rdquo; he continued, lowering
his voice; &ldquo;have you anything to add consarnin'
him? It's almosht a pity to put him
onder de water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the sloop ready to sail?&rdquo; asked Wild,
without noticing the skipper's remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja,&rdquo; answered Van; &ldquo;at a minut's nodish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Here are your despatches,&rdquo; said Jonathan</pp>
<pb n="80">
<pp>with a significant look, and giving him a sealed
packet. &ldquo;Open them when you get on board
&mdash;not before, and act as they direct you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I ondershtand,&rdquo; replied the skipper, putting
his finger to his nose; &ldquo;it shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Rowland,&rdquo; said Jonathan, turning to
the knight, &ldquo;will it please you to remain here
till I return, or will you accompany us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; answered Trenchard,
who, by this time, had regained his composure,
and with it all his relentlessness of purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said Wild, marching towards
the door, &ldquo;we 've no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Quitting the night&hyphen;cellar, the trio soon arrived
at the river&hyphen;side. Quilt Arnold was stationed
at the stair&hyphen;head, near which the boat
containing the captive boy was moored. A
few words passed between him and the thieftaker
as the latter came up; after which, all
the party&mdash;with the exception of Quilt, who
was left on shore&mdash;embarked within the
wherry, which was pushed from the strand
and rowed swiftly along the stream&mdash;for the
tide was in its favour&mdash;by a couple of watermen.
Though scarcely two hours past midnight,
it was perfectly light. The moon had</pp>
<pb n="81">
<pp>arisen, and everything could be as plainly distinguished
as during the day. A thin mist lay
on the river, giving the few craft moving about
in it a ghostly look. As they approached
London Bridge, the thieftaker whispered Van
Galgebrok, who acted as steersman, to make
for a particular arch&mdash;near the Surrey shore.
The skipper obeyed, and in another moment,
they swept through the narrow lock. While
the watermen were contending with the eddies
occasioned by the fall below the bridge, Jonathan
observed a perceptible shudder run through
Trenchard's frame.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that starling, Sir Rowland,'
he said maliciously, &ldquo;and what occurred on it,
twelve years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too well,&rdquo; answered the knight, frowning.
&ldquo;Ah! what is that?&rdquo; he cried, pointing to a
dark object floating near them amid the boiling
waves, and which presented a frightful resemblance
to a human face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll see,&rdquo; returned the thieftaker. And,
stretching out his hand, he lifted the dark
object from the flood.</p>
<p><pp>It proved to be a human head, though with
scarcely a vestige of the features remaining.</pp>
<pb n="82">
<pp>Here and there, patches of flesh adhered to
the bones, and the dank dripping hair hanging
about what had once been the face, gave it a
ghastly appearance.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It's the skull of a <it>rebel</it>,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
with marked emphasis on the word, &ldquo;blown
by the wind from a spike on the bridge above
us. I don't know whose brainless head it may
be, but it'll do for my collection.&rdquo; And he
tossed it carelessly into the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>After this occurrence, not a word was exchanged
between them until they came in sight
of the sloop, which was lying at anchor off
Wapping. Arrived at her side, it was soon
evident, from the throng of seamen in Dutch
dresses that displayed themselves, that her
crew were on the alert, and a rope having been
thrown down to the skipper, he speedily
hoisted himself on deck. Preparations were
next made for taking Thames on board. Raising
him in his arms, Jonathan passed the rope
round his body, and in this way the poor boy
was drawn up without difficulty.</p>
<p>While he was swinging in mid air, Thames
regarded his uncle with a stern look, and cried
in a menacing voice, &ldquo;We shall meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="83">
<p>&ldquo;Not in this world,&rdquo; returned Jonathan.
&ldquo;Weigh anchor, Van!&rdquo; he shouted to the
skipper, &ldquo;and consult your despatches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja&mdash;ja,&rdquo; returned the Hollander. And
catching hold of Thames, he quitted the deck.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, he re&hyphen;appeared with the
information that the captive was safe below; 
and giving the necessary directions to his
crew, before many minutes had elapsed, the
Zeeslang spread her canvass to the first breeze
of morning.</p>
<p>By the thieftaker's command, the boat was
then rowed toward a muddy inlet, which has
received in more recent times the name of
Execution Dock. As soon as she reached this
spot, Wild sprang ashore, and was joined by
several persons,&mdash;among whom was Quilt Arnold,
leading a horse by the bridle,&mdash;he hastened
down the stairs to meet him. A coach
was also in attendance, at a little distance.</p>
<p>Sir Rowland, who had continued absorbed
in thought, with his eyes fixed upon the sloop
as she made her way slowly down the river,
disembarked more leisurely.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;At length I am my own master,&rdquo; murmured</pp>
<pb n="84">
<pp>the knight, as his foot touched the
strand.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; returned Jonathan; 
&ldquo;you are my prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; ejaculated Trenchard, starting back
and drawing his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are arrested for high treason,&rdquo; rejoined
Wild, presenting a pistol at his head,
while he drew forth a parchment,&mdash;&ldquo;here is
my warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; cried Sir Rowland&mdash;&ldquo;damned&mdash; 
double&hyphen;dyed traitor!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Away with him,&rdquo; vociferated Jonathan to
his myrmidons, who, having surrounded Trenchard,
hurried him off to the coach before he
could utter another word,&mdash;&ldquo;first to Mr. Walpole,
and then to Newgate. And now, Quilt,&rdquo; 
he continued, addressing the janizary, who approached
him with the horse, &ldquo;fly to St.
Giles's roundhouse, and if, through the agency
of that treacherous scoundrel, Terry O'Flaherty,
whom I've put in my Black List, old Wood
should have found his way there, and have
been detained by Sharples as I directed, you
may release him. I don't care how soon he</pp>
<pb n="85">
<pp>learns that he has lost his adopted son. When
I 've escorted yon proud fool to his new quarters,
I 'll proceed to the Mint and look after
Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>With this, he mounted his steed and rode
off.</p></div4>

<subhead>HOW JACK SHEPPARD BROKE OUT OF THE CAGE
AT WILLESDEN.</subhead> <attbytes>14Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030645</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard. A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><pp><smallcap>The</smallcap> heart&hyphen;piercing scream uttered by Mrs.
Sheppard after the commission of the robbery
in Willesden church was productive of unfortunate
consequences to her son. Luckily, she
was bereft of consciousness, and was thus
spared the additional misery of witnessing what
afterwards befell him. Startled by the cry,
as may be supposed, the attention of the whole
congregation was drawn towards the quarter
whence it proceeded. Amongst others, a
person near the door, roused by the shriek,
observed a man make his exit with the utmost
precipitation. A boy attempted to follow; but
as the suspicions of the lookers&hyphen;on were roused
by the previous circumstances, the younger
fugitive was seized and detained. Meanwhile,
Mr. Kneebone, having been alarmed by something
in the widow's look before her feelings
found vent in the manner above described,
thrust his hand instinctively into his coat in</pp>
<pb n="87">
<pp>search of his pocket&hyphen;book,&mdash;about the security
of which, as it contained several letters and
documents implicating himself and others in
the Jacobite plot, he was, not unnaturally, solicitous,
&mdash;and finding it gone, he felt certain
he had been robbed. Turning quickly round,
in the hope of discovering the thief, he was no
less surprised than distressed&mdash;for in spite of
his faults, the woollen&hyphen;draper was a goodnatured
fellow&mdash;to perceive Jack Sheppard in
custody. The truth at once flashed across his
mind. This, then, was the cause of the widow's
wild inexplicable look,&mdash;of her sudden
shriek! Explaining his suspicions in a whisper
to Jack's captor, who proved to be a church&hyphen;warden
and a constable, by name John Dump,
&mdash;Mr. Kneebone begged him to take the
prisoner into the churchyard. Dump instantly
complied, and as soon as Jack was removed
from the sacred edifice, his person was searched
from head to foot&mdash;but without success. Jack
submitted to this scrutiny with a very bad grace,
and vehemently protested his innocence. In
vain did the woollen&hyphen;draper offer to set him
free if he would restore the stolen article, or
give up his associate, to whom it was supposed</pp>
<pb n="88">
<pp>he might have handed it. He answered with
the greatest assurance, that he knew nothing
whatever of the matter&mdash;had seen no pocket&hyphen;book,
and no associate to give up. Nor did
he content himself with declaring his guiltlessness
of the crime imputed to him, but began
in his turn to menace his captor and accuser,
loading the latter with the bitterest upbraidings.
By this time, the churchyard was
crowded with spectators, some of whom dispersed
in different directions in quest of the
other robber. But all that could be ascertained
in the village was, that a man had ridden
off a short time before in the direction of
London. Of this man Kneebone resolved to
go in pursuit; and leaving Jack in charge of
the constable, he proceeded to the small inn,
&mdash;which bore then, as it bears now, the name
of the Six Bells,&mdash;where, summoning the
hostler, his steed was instantly brought him,
and, springing on its back, he rode away at
full speed.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Meanwhile, after a consultation between
Mr. Dump and the village authorities, it was
agreed to lock up the prisoner in the cage. As
he was conveyed thither, an incident occurred</pp>
<pb n="89">
<pp>that produced a considerable impression on the
feelings of the youthful offender. Just as they
reached the eastern outlet of the church&hyphen;yard
&mdash;where the tall elms cast a pleasant shade over
the rustic graves&mdash;a momentary stoppage took
place. At this gate two paths meet. Down
that on the right the young culprit was dragged
&mdash;along that on the left a fainting woman was
borne in the arms of several females. It was
his mother, and as he gazed on her pallid
features and motionless frame, Jack's heart
severely smote him. He urged his conductors
to a quicker pace to get out of sight of the distressing
spectacle, and even felt relieved when
he was shut out from it and the execrations
of the mob by the walls of the little prison.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The cage at Willesden was, and is&mdash;for it is
still standing&mdash;a small round building about
eight feet high, with a pointed tiled roof, to
which a number of boards, inscribed with the
names of the parish officers, and charged with
a multitude of admonitory notices to vagrants
and other disorderly persons, are attached.
Over these boards the two arms of a guidepost
serve to direct the way&hyphen;farer&mdash;on the
right hand to the neighbouring villages of</pp>
<pb n="90">
<pp>Neasdon and Kingsbury, and on the left to
the Edgeware Road and the healthy heights of
Hampstead. The cage has a strong door, with
an iron grating at the top, and further secured
by a stout bolt and padlock. It is picturesquely
situated beneath a tree on the high
road, not far from the little hostel before mentioned,
and at no great distance from the
church.</pp></p>
<p><pp>For some time after he was locked up in this
prison Jack continued in a very dejected state.
Deserted by his older companion in iniquity,
and instigator to crime, he did not know
what might become of him; nor, as we have
observed, was the sad spectacle he had just
witnessed, without effect. Though within the
last two days he had committed several heinous
offences, and one of a darker dye than any
with which the reader has been made acquainted,
his breast was not yet so callous as
to be wholly insensible to the stings of conscience.
Wearied at length with thinking on
the past, and terrified by the prospect of the
future, he threw himself on the straw with
which the cage was littered, and endeavoured
to compose himself to slumber. When he</pp>
<pb n="91">
<pp>awoke, it was late in the day; but though he
heard voices outside, and now and then caught
a glimpse of a face peeping at him through
the iron grating over the door, no one entered
the prison, or held any communication with
him. Feeling rather exhausted, it occurred to
him that possibly some provisions might have
been left by the constable; and, looking about,
he perceived a pitcher of water and a small
brown loaf on the floor. He ate of the bread
with great appetite, and having drunk as much
as he chose of the water, poured the rest on
the floor. His hunger satisfied, his spirits
began to revive, and with this change of mood
all his natural audacity returned. And here he
was first visited by that genius which, in his
subsequent career, prompted him to so many
bold and successful attempts. Glancing around
his prison, he began to think it possible he
might effect an escape from it. The door was
too strong, and too well secured, to break
open,&mdash;the walls too thick: but the ceiling,&mdash; 
if he could reach it&mdash;there, he doubted not,
he could make an outlet. While he was mediating
flight in this way, and tossing about
on the straw, he chanced upon an old broken</pp>
<pb n="92">
<pp>and rusty fork. Here was an instrument which
might be of the greatest service to him in accomplishing
his design. He put it carefully
aside, resolved to defer the attempt till night.
Time wore on somewhat slowly with the prisoner,
who had to control his impatience in
the best way he could; but as the shades of
evening were darkening, the door was unlocked,
and Mr. Dump popped his head into the cage.
He brought another small loaf, and a can with
which he replenished the pitcher, recommending
Jack to be careful, as he would get nothing
further till morning. To this Jack replied,
that he should be perfectly contented, provided
he might have a small allowance of gin. The
latter request, though treated with supreme
contempt by Mr. Dump, made an impression
on some one outside; for not long after the
constable departed, Jack heard a tap at the
door, and getting up at the summons, he perceived
the tube of a pipe inserted between the
bars. At once devining the meaning of this
ingenious device, he applied his mouth to the
tube, and sucked away, while the person outside
poured spirit into the bowl. Having
drunk as much as he thought prudent, and</pp>
<pb n="93">
<pp>thanked his unknown friend for his attention,
Jack again lay down on the straw, and indulged
himself with another nap, intending to
get up as soon as it was perfectly dark. The
strong potation he had taken, combined with
fatigue and anxiety he had previously undergone,
made him oversleep himself, and when
he awoke it was just beginning to grow light.
Cursing himself for his inertness, Jack soon
shook off his drowsiness, and set to work in
earnest. Availing himself of certain inequalities
in the door, he soon managed to climb
up to the roof; and securing his feet against
a slight projection in the wall, began to use
the fork with great effect. Before many minutes
elapsed, he had picked a large hole in
the plaster, which showered down in a cloud
of dust; and breaking off several laths, caught
hold of a beam, by which he held with one
hand, until with the other he succeeded, not
without some difficulty, in forcing out one of
the tiles. The rest was easy. In a few minutes
more he had made a breach in the roof
wide enough to allow him to pass through.
Emerging from this aperture, he was about
to descend, when he was alarmed by hearing</pp>
<pb n="94">
<pp>the tramp of horses' feet swiftly approaching,
and had only time to hide himself behind one
of the largest sign&hyphen;boards before alluded to
when two horsemen rode up. Instead of
passing on, as Jack expected, these persons
stopped opposite the cage, when one of them,
as he judged from the sound, for he did not
dare to look out of his hiding place, dismounted.
A noise was next heard, as if some
instrument were applied to the door with the
intent to force it open, and Jack's fears were
at once dispelled. At first, he had imagined
they were officers of justice, come to convey
him to a stronger prison; but the voice of one
of the parties, which he recognized, convinced
him they were his friends.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Look quick, Blueskin, and be cursed to
you!&rdquo; was growled in the deep tones of Jonathan
Wild. &ldquo;We shall have the whole village
upon us while you're striking the jigger. Use
the gilt, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's no need of picklock or crow&hyphen;bar,
here, Mr. Wild,&rdquo; cried Jack, placing his hat
on the right arm of the guide&hyphen;post, and
leaning over the board, &ldquo;I 've done the trick
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>350Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010114">
<pb n="95">
<p>&ldquo;Why, what the devil's this?&rdquo; vociferated
Jonathan, looking up. &ldquo;Have you broken out
of the cage, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like it,&rdquo; replied the lad carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried the thieftaker approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that beats all I ever heard of!&rdquo; 
roared Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you really there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I'm here,&rdquo; answered Jack, leaping
down. &ldquo;I tell you what, Mr. Wild,&rdquo; he added,
laughing, &ldquo;it must be a stronger prison than
Willesden cage that can hold me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; observed Jonathan, &ldquo;you 'll give
the keepers of his Majesty's jails some trouble
before you're many years older, I'll warrant
you. But get up behind, Blueskin. Some one
may observe us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Come, jump up,&rdquo; cried Blueskin, mounting
his steed, &ldquo;and I 'll soon wisk you to
town. Edgeworth Bess and Poll Maggot are
dying to see you. I thought Bess would have
cried her pretty eyes out when she heard you
was nabbed. You need give yourself no more</pp>
<pb n="96">
<pp>concern about Kneebone. Mr. Wild has done
his business.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;ay,&rdquo; laughed Jonathan. &ldquo;The
pocket&hyphen;book you prigged contained the letters
I wanted. He's now in spring&hyphen;ankle warehouse
with Sir Rowland Trenchard. So get
up, and let's be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I leave this place, I must see
my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; returned Jonathan gruffly.
&ldquo;Would you expose yourself to fresh risk?
If it hadn't been for her you wouldn't have
been placed in your late jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't care for that,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;See
her I <it>will</it>. Leave me behind: I'm not
afraid. I'll be at the Cross Shovels in the
course of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, if you're bent upon this folly,&rdquo; 
observed Wild, who appeared to have his own
reasons for humouring the lad, &ldquo;I shan't
hinder you. Blueskin will take care of the
horses, and I'll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>So saying, he dismounted; and flinging his
bridle to his companion, and ordering him to
ride off to a little distance, he followed Jack,
who had quitted the main road, and struck</pp>
<pb n="97">
<pp>into a narrow path opposite the cage. This
path, bordered on each side by high privet
hedges of the most beautiful green, soon
brought them to a stile.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;There's the house,&rdquo; said Jack, pointing
to a pretty cottage, the small wooden porch of
which was covered with roses and creepers,
with a little trim garden in front of it. &ldquo;I'll
be back in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't hurry yourself,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
&ldquo;I'll wait for you here.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>As</smallcap> Jack opened the gate, and crossed the
little garden, which exhibited in every part the
neatness and attention of its owner, he almost
trembled at the idea of further disturbing her
peace of mind. Pausing with the intention of
turning back, he glanced in the direction of
the village church, the tower of which could
just be seen through the trees. The rooks
were cawing amid the boughs, and all nature
appeared awaking to happiness. From this
peaceful scene Jack's eye fell upon Jonathan,
who, seated upon the stile, under the shade
of an elder tree, was evidently watching him.
A sarcastic smile seemed to play upon the
thieftaker's lips; and abashed at his own irresolution,
the lad went on.</p>
<p><pp>After knocking for some time at the door
without effect, he tried the latch, and to his</pp>
<pb n="99">
<pp>surprise found it open. He stepped in with a
heavy foreboding of calamity. A cat came
and rubbed herself against him as he entered
the house, and seemed by her mewing to ask
him for food. That was the only sound he
heard.</pp></p>
<p>Jack was almost afraid of speaking; but at
length he summoned courage to call out
&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; asked a faint voice from
the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son,&rdquo; answered the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; exclaimed the widow, starting up
and drawing back the curtain. Is it indeed
you, or am I dreaming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're not dreaming, mother,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I'm come to say good bye to you,
and to assure you of my safety before I leave
this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; returned Jack; &ldquo;but it's
not safe for me to remain much longer here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the widow, upon whom all
the terrible recollections of the day before
crowded, &ldquo;I know it isn't. I won't keep you
long. But tell me how have you escaped from</pp>
<pb n="100">
<pp>the confinement in which you were placed&mdash; 
come and sit by me&mdash;here&mdash;upon the bed&mdash; 
give me your hand&mdash;and tell me all about it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Her son complied, and sat down upon the
patch&hyphen;work coverlet beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard, clasping him
with a hand that burnt with fever, &ldquo;I have
been ill&mdash;dreadfully ill&mdash;I believe delirious&mdash;I
thought I should have died last night&mdash;I won't
tell you what agony you have caused me&mdash;I
won't reproach you. Only promise me to
amend&mdash;to quit your vile companions&mdash;and I
will forgive you&mdash;will bless you. Oh! my
dear, dear son, be warned in time. You are
in the hands of a wicked, a terrible man, who
will not stop till he has completed your destruction.
Listen to your mother's prayers,
and do not let her die broken&hyphen;hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; returned Jack, sullenly; &ldquo;I
can't be honest, if I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Oh! do not say so,&rdquo; replied his wretched
parent. &ldquo;It is never too late. I know you
are in Jonathan Wild's power, for I saw him
near you in the church; and if ever the enemy
of mankind was permitted to take human form,
I beheld him then. Beware of him, my son!</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>410Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010115">
<pb n="101">
<pp>Beware of him! You know not what villany
he is capable of. Be honest, and you will be
happy. You are yet a child; and though you
have strayed from the right path, a stronger
hand than your own has led you thence. Return,
I implore of you, to your master,&mdash;to Mr.
Wood. Acknowledge your faults. He is all
kindness, and will overlook them for your poor
father's sake&mdash;for mine. Return to him, I
say&mdash;&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't,&rdquo; replied Jack, doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't!&rdquo; repeated his mother. &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'<it>ll</it> tell you,&rdquo; cried a deep voice from the
back of the bed. And immediately afterwards
the curtain was drawn aside, and disclosed
the Satanic countenance of Jonathan
Wild, who had crept into the house unperceived.
&ldquo;I'll tell you, why he can't go back
to his master,&rdquo; cried the thieftaker, with a
malignant grin. &ldquo;He has robbed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed him!&rdquo; screamed the widow.
&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her son averted his gaze.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Ay, robbed him,&rdquo; reiterated Jonathan.
&ldquo;The night before last, Mr. Wood's house</pp>
<pb n="102">
<pp>was broken into and plundered. Your son
was seen by the carpenter's wife in company
with the robbers. Here,&rdquo; he added, throwing
a handbill on the bed, &ldquo;are the particulars of
the burglary, with the reward for Jack's apprehension.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated the widow, hiding her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Wild, turning authoritatively
to Jack,&mdash;&ldquo;you have overstayed your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go with him, Jack!&rdquo; shrieked his
mother. &ldquo;Do not&mdash;do not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <it>must</it>!&rdquo; thundered Jonathan, &ldquo;or he
goes to gaol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must go to prison, I will go with
you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard: &ldquo;but avoid that
man as you would a serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; thundered Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, Jack!&rdquo; shrieked his mother.
&ldquo;You know not what you do. The wretch
you confide in has sworn to hang you. As I
hope for mercy, I speak the truth!&mdash;let him
deny it if he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Wild. &ldquo;I could hang him
now if I liked. But he may remain with you
if he pleases: <it>I</it> sha'n't hinder him.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="103">
<p>&ldquo;You hear, my son,&rdquo; said the widow eagerly.
&ldquo;Choose between good and evil;&mdash;between
him and me. And mind, your life,&mdash;more
than your life&mdash;hangs upon your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does so,&rdquo; said Wild. &ldquo;Choose, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad made no answer, but left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard despairingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ever!&rdquo; said the thieftaker, preparing
to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil!&rdquo; cried the widow, catching his arm,
and gazing with frantic eagerness in his face,
&ldquo;how many years will you give my son before
you execute your terrible threat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<smallcap>nine</smallcap>!&rdquo; answered Jonathan sternly.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Nearly</smallcap> nine years after the events last recorded,
and about the middle of May, 1724, a
young man of remarkably prepossessing appearance
took his way, one afternoon, along
Wych&hyphen;street; and, from the curiosity with
which he regarded the houses on the left of
the road, seemed to be in search of some particular
habitation. The age of this individual
could not be more than twenty&hyphen;one; his figure
was tall, robust, and gracefully proportioned; 
and his clear grey eye and open countenance
bespoke a frank, generous, and resolute nature.
His features were regular, and finely&hyphen;formed; 
his complexion bright and blooming,&mdash;a little
shaded, however, by travel and exposure to the
sun; and, with a praiseworthy contempt for</pp>
<pb n="108">
<pp>the universal and preposterous fashion then
prevailing, of substituting a peruke for the
natural covering of the head, he allowed his
own dark&hyphen;brown hair to fall over his shoulders
in ringlets as luxuriant as those that distinguished
the court gallant in Charles the Second's
days&mdash;a fashion, which we do not despair
of seeing revived in our own days. He
wore a French military undress of the period,
with high jack&hyphen;boots, and a laced hat; and,
though his attire indicated no particular rank,
he had completely the air of a person of distinction.
Such was the effect produced upon
the passengers by his good looks and manly
deportment, that few&mdash;especially of the gentler
and more susceptible sex&mdash;failed to turn round
and bestow a second glance upon the handsome
stranger. Unconscious of the interest
he excited, and entirely occupied by his own
thoughts&mdash;which, if his bosom could have
been examined, would have been found composed
of mingled hopes and fears&mdash;the young
man walked on till he came to an old house,
with great, projecting, bay windows on the
first floor, and situated as nearly as possible at
the back of St. Clement's church. Here he</pp>
<pb n="109">
<pp>halted; and, looking upwards, read, at the foot
of an immense sign&hyphen;board, displaying a gaudily&hyphen;painted
angel with expanded pinions and
an olive&hyphen;branch, not the name he expected to
find, but that of WILLIAM KNEEBONE,
WOOLLEN&hyphen;DRAPER.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Tears started to the young man's eyes on
beholding the change, and it was with difficulty
he could command himself sufficiently to make
the inquiries he desired to do respecting the
former owner of the house. As he entered the
shop, a tall portly personage advanced to meet
him, whom he at once recognised as the present
proprietor. Mr. Kneebone was attired in
the extremity of the mode. A full&hyphen;curled wig
descended half&hyphen;way down his back and shoulders; 
a neckcloth of &ldquo;right Mechlin&rdquo; was
twisted round his throat so tightly as almost
to deprive him of breath, and threaten him
with apoplexy; he had lace, also, at his wrists
and bosom; gold clocks to his hose, and red
heels to his shoes. A stiff, formally&hyphen;cut coat
of cinnamon&hyphen;coloured cloth, with rows of plate
buttons, each of the size of a crown piece, on
the sleeves, pockets, and skirts, reached the
middle of his legs; and his costume was completed</pp>
<pb n="110">
<pp>by the silver&hyphen;hilted sword at his side,
and the laced hat under his left arm.</pp></p>
<p>Bowing to the stranger, the woollen&hyphen;draper
very politely requested to know his business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm almost afraid to state it,&rdquo; faltered the
other; &ldquo;but, may I ask whether Mr. Wood, the
carpenter, who formerly resided here, is still
living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel any anxiety on his account, sir,
I'm happy to be able to relieve it,&rdquo; answered
Kneebone, readily. &ldquo;My good friend, Owen
Wood,&mdash;heaven preserve him!&mdash;<it>is</it> still living.
And, for a man who'll never see sixty again,
he's in excellent preservation, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You delight me with the intelligence,&rdquo; 
said the stranger, entirely recovering his cheerfulness
of look. &ldquo;I began to fear, from his
having quitted the old place, that some misfortune
must have befallen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Quite the contrary,&rdquo; rejoined the woollen&hyphen;draper,
laughing good&hyphen;humouredly. &ldquo;Everything
has prospered with him in an extraordinary
manner. His business has thriven; 
legacies have unexpectedly dropped into his
lap; and, to crown all, he has made a large
fortune by a lucky speculation in South&hyphen;Sea</pp>
<pb n="111">
<pp>stock,&mdash;made it, too, where so many others have
lost fortunes, your humble servant amongst
the number&mdash;ha! ha! In a word, sir, Mr.
Wood is now in very affluent circumstances.
He stuck to the shop as long as it was necessary,
and longer, in my opinion: When he
left these premises, three years ago, I took
them from him; or rather&mdash;to deal frankly
with you,&mdash;he placed me in them rent&hyphen;free,
for, I'm not ashamed to confess it, I've had
losses, and heavy ones; and, if it hadn't been
for him, I don't know where I should have
been. Mr. Wood, sir,&rdquo; he added, with much
emotion, &ldquo;is one of the best of men, and
would be the happiest, were it not that&mdash;&rdquo; 
and he hesitated.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; cried the other, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife is still living,&rdquo; returned Kneebone,
drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied the stranger, unable
to repress a smile. &ldquo;But, it strikes me,
I've heard that Mrs. Wood was once a favourite
of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;So she was,&rdquo; replied the woollen&hyphen;draper,
helping himself to an enormous pinch of snuff
with the air of a man who does not dislike to</pp>
<pb n="112">
<pp>be rallied about his gallantry,&mdash;&ldquo;so she was.
But those days are over&mdash;quite over. Since
her husband has laid me under such a weight
of obligation, I couldn't, in honour, continue&mdash; 
hem!&rdquo; and he took another explanatory pinch.
&ldquo;Added to which, she is neither so young as
she was, nor is her temper by any means improved
&mdash;hem!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more on the subject, sir,&rdquo; observed
the stranger, gravely; &ldquo;but let us turn to a
more agreeable one&mdash;her daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a far more agreeable one, I must
confess,&rdquo; returned Kneebone, with a self&hyphen;sufficient
smirk.</p>
<p>The stranger looked at him as if strongly
disposed to chastise his impertinence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she married?&rdquo; he asked, after a brief
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married!&mdash;no&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied the woollen&hyphen;draper.
Winifred Wood will never marry,
unless the grave can give up its dead. When
a mere child, she fixed her affections upon a
youth named Thames Darrell, whom her father
brought up, and who perished, it is supposed,
about nine years ago; and she has determined
to remain faithful to his memory.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="113">
<p>&ldquo;You astonish me,&rdquo; said the stranger, in a
voice full of emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it <it>is</it> astonishing, certainly,&rdquo; remarked
Kneebone, &ldquo;to find any woman constant&mdash; 
especially to a girlish attachment; but such is
the case. She has had offers innumerable; 
for where wealth and beauty are combined, as
in her instance, suitors are seldom wanting.
But she was not to be tempted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a matchless creature!&rdquo; exclaimed
the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think,&rdquo; replied Kneebone, again applying
to the snuff&hyphen;box, and by that means
escaping the angry glance levelled at him by
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one enquiry more to make of
you, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, as soon as he had
conquered his displeasure, &ldquo;and I will then
trouble you no further. You spoke just now
of a youth whom Mr. Wood brought up. As
far as I recollect, there were two. What has
become of the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, surely you don't mean Jack Sheppard?&rdquo; 
cried the woollen&hyphen;draper in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the lad's name?&rdquo; returned the
stranger.</p>
<pb n="114">
<p><pp>&ldquo;I guessed from your dress and manner, sir,
that you must have been long absent from your
own country,&rdquo; said Kneebone; &ldquo;and now I'm
convinced of it, or you wouldn't have asked
that question. Jack Sheppard is the talk and
terror of the whole town. The ladies can't
sleep in their beds for him; and as to the men,
they daren't go to bed at all. He's the most
daring and expert housebreaker that ever used
a crow&hyphen;bar. He laughs at locks and bolts; and
the more carefully you guard your premises
from him, the more likely are you to insure an
attack. His exploits and escapes are in every
body's mouth. He has been lodged in every
roundhouse in the metropolis, and has broken
out of them all, and boasts that no prison can
hold him. We shall see. His skill has not
been tried. At present, he is under the protection
of Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that villain still maintain his power?&rdquo; 
asked the stranger sternly.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; replied Kneebone, &ldquo;and, what
is more surprising, it seems to increase. Jonathan
completely baffles and derides the ends
of justice. It is useless to contend with him,
even with right on your side. Some years ago,</pp>
<pb n="115">
<pp>in 1715, just before the Rebellion, I was rash
enough to league myself with the Jacobite
party, and by Wild's machinations got clapped
into Newgate, whence I was glad to escape
with my head upon my shoulders. I charged
the thieftaker, as was the fact, with having
robbed me, by means of the lad Sheppard,
whom he instigated to the deed, of the very
pocket&hyphen;book he produced in evidence against
me; but it was of no avail&mdash;I couldn't obtain
a hearing. Mr. Wood fared still worse.
Bribed by a certain Sir Rowland Trenchard,
Jonathan kidnapped the carpenter's adopted
son, Thames Darrell, and placed him in the
hands of a Dutch Skipper, with orders to throw
him overboard when he got out to sea; and
though this was proved as clear as day, the
rascal managed matters so adroitly, and gave
such a different complexion to the whole affair,
that he came off with flying colours. One reason,
perhaps, of his success in this case might
be, that having arrested his associate in the
dark transaction, Sir Rowland Trenchard, on a
charge of high treason, he was favoured by
Walpole, who found his account in retaining
such an agent. Be this as it may, Jonathan</pp>
<pb n="116">
<pp>remained the victor; and shortly afterwards,&mdash; 
at the price of a third of his estate, it was
whispered,&mdash;he procured Trenchard's liberation
from confinement.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>At the mention of the latter occurrence, a
dark cloud gathered upon the stranger's brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything further of Sir
Rowland?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more than this,&rdquo; answered Kneebone,
&mdash;&ldquo;that after the failure of his projects,
and the downfall of his party, he retired to his
seat, Ashton Hall, near Manchester, and has
remained there ever since, entirely secluded
from the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger was for a moment lost in reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; he said, preparing to take
his departure, &ldquo;will you add to the obligation
already conferred by informing me where I
can meet with Mr. Wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; replied the woollen&hyphen;draper.
He lives at Dollis Hill, a beautiful spot
near Willesden, about four or five miles from
town, where he has taken a farm. If you ride
out there,&mdash;and the place is well worth a visit,
for the magnificent view it commands of some</pp>
<pb n="117">
<pp>of the finest country in the neighbourhood of
London,&mdash;you are certain to meet with him.
I saw him yesterday, and he told me he shouldn't
stir from home for a week to come. He
called here on his way back, after he had
been to Bedlam to visit poor Mrs. Shepdard.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack's mother!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man.
&ldquo;Gracious heaven!&mdash;is she the inmate of a
mad&hyphen;house?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;She is, sir,&rdquo; answered the woollen&hyphen;draper,
sadly, &ldquo;driven there by her son's misconduct.
Alas! that the punishment of his offences
should fall on her head. Poor soul! she
nearly died when she heard he had robbed
his master; and it might have been well if she
had done so, for she never afterwards recovered
her reason. She rambles continually about
Jack, and her husband, and that wretch Jonathan,
to whom, as far as can be gathered
from her wild ravings, she attributes all her
misery. I pity her from the bottom of my
heart. But, in the midst of all her affliction,
she has found a steady friend in Mr. Wood,
who looks after her comforts, and visits her</pp>
<pb n="118">
<pp>constantly. Indeed, I've heard him say that,
but for his wife, he would shelter her under
his own roof. That, sir, is what I call being
a Good Samaritan.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>The stranger said nothing, but hastily brushed
away a tear. Perceiving he was about to take
leave, Kneebone ventured to ask whom he
had had the honour of addressing.</p>
<p>Before the question could be answered, a
side&hyphen;door was opened, and a very handsome
woman of Amazonian proportions presented
herself, and marched familiarly up to Mr. Kneebone.
She was extremely showily dressed,
and her large hooped petticoat gave additional
effect to her lofty stature. As soon as she
noticed the stranger, she honoured him with
an extremely impudent stare, and scarcely endeavoured
to disguise the admiration with
which his good looks impressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't you perceive, my dear Mrs. Maggot,
that I'm engaged,&rdquo; said Kneebone, a little
disconcerted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who've you got with you?&rdquo; demanded
the Amazon, boldly.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;The gentleman is a stranger to me, Poll,&rdquo;</pp>
<pb n="119">
<pp>replied the woollen&hyphen;draper, with increased embarrassment.
&ldquo;I don't know his name.&rdquo; And
he looked at the moment as if he had lost all
desire to know it.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he's a pretty fellow at all events,&rdquo; 
observed Mrs. Maggot, eyeing him from head
to heel with evident satisfaction;&mdash;&ldquo;a devilish
pretty fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Poll,&rdquo; said Kneebone, becoming
very red, &ldquo;you might have a little
more delicacy than to tell him so before my
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Maggot, drawing
up her fine figure to its full height; &ldquo;because
I condescend to live with you, am I never to
look at another man,&mdash;especially at one so
much to my taste as this? Don't think it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better retire, madam,&rdquo; said the
woolen&hyphen;draper, sharply, &ldquo;if you can't conduct
yourself with more propriety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order those who choose to obey you,&rdquo; 
rejoined the lady scornfully. &ldquo;Though you
lorded it over that fond fool, Mrs. Wood, you
shan't lord it over me, I can promise you.
That for you!&rdquo; And she snapped her fingers
in his face.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="120">
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; cried Kneebone, furiously. &ldquo;Go
to your own room, woman, directly, or I'll
make you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make me!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Maggot, bursting
into a loud contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;Try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enraged at the assurance of his mistress,
the woollen&hyphen;draper endeavoured to carry his
threat into execution, but all his efforts to
remove her were unavailing. At length, after
he had given up the point from sheer exhaustion,
the Amazon seized him by the throat,
and pushed him backwards with such force
that he rolled over the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she cried, laughing, &ldquo;that'll teach
you to lay hands upon me again. You should
remember, before you try your strength against
mine, that when I rescued you from the watch,
and you induced me to come and live with
you, I beat off four men, any of whom was a
match for you&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Poll!&rdquo; said Kneebone, picking
himself up, &ldquo;I intreat you to moderate yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Intreat a fiddlestick!&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Maggot:
&ldquo;I'm tired of you, and will go back to
my old lover, Jack Sheppard. He's worth a</pp>
<pb n="121">
<pp>dozen of you. Or, if this good&hyphen;looking young
fellow will only say the word, I'll go with
him.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go, and welcome, madam!&rdquo; rejoined
Kneebone, spitefully. &ldquo;But, I should
think, after the specimen you've just given of
your amiable disposition, no person would be
likely to saddle himself with such an incumbrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you, sir?&rdquo; said the Amazon,
with an engaging leer at the stranger. &ldquo;<it>You</it>
will find me tractable enough; and, with <it>me</it>
by your side, you need fear neither constable
nor watchman. I've delivered Jack Sheppard
from many an assault. I can wield a quarterstaff
as well as a prize&hyphen;fighter, and have beaten
Figg himself at the broadsword. Will you
take me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However tempting Mrs. Maggot's offer may
appear, the young man thought fit to decline
it, and, after a few words of well&hyphen;merited
compliment on her extraordinary prowess, and
renewed thanks to Mr. Kneebone, he took his
departure.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Good bye!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maggot, kissing
her hand to him. &ldquo;I'll find you out. And</pp>
<pb n="122">
<pp>now,&rdquo; she added, glancing contemptuously at
the woolen&hyphen;draper, &ldquo;I'll go to Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall first go to Bridewell, you jade!&rdquo; 
rejoined Kneebone. &ldquo;Here, Tom,&rdquo; he added,
calling to a shop&hyphen;boy, &ldquo;run and fetch a constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had better bring half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen,&rdquo; said
the Amazon, taking up a cloth&hyphen;yard wand, and
quietly seating herself; &ldquo;one won't do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>On leaving Mr. Kneebone's house, the
young man hastened to a hotel in the neighbourhood
of Covent Garden, where, having
procured a horse, he shaped his course towards
the west end of the town. Urging his
steed along Oxford Road,&mdash;as that great approach
to the metropolis was then termed,
&mdash;he soon passed Marylebone Lane, beyond
which, with the exception of a few scattered
houses, the country was completely open on
the right, and laid out in pleasant fields and
gardens; nor did he draw in the rein until he
arrived at Tyburn&hyphen;gate, where, before he
turned off upon the Edgeware Road, he halted
for a moment, to glance at the place of execution.
This &ldquo;fatal retreat for the unfortunate</pp>
<pb n="123">
<pp>brave&rdquo; was marked by a low wooden railing,
within which stood the triple tree. Opposite
the gallows was an open gallery, or scaffolding,
like the stand at a race&hyphen;course, which, on state
occasions, was crowded with spectators. Without
the inclosure were reared several lofty gibbets,
with their ghastly burthens. Altogether,
it was a hideous and revolting sight. Influenced,
probably, by what he had heard from
Mr. Kneebone, respecting the lawless career
of Jack Sheppard, and struck with the probable
fate that awaited him, the young man,
as he contemplated this scene, fell into a
gloomy reverie. While he was thus musing,
two horsemen rode past him; and, proceeding
to a little distance, stopped likewise. One of
them was a stout square&hyphen;built man, with a
singularly swarthy complexion, and harsh forbidding
features. He was well mounted, as
was his companion; and had pistols in his
holsters, and a hanger at his girdle. The
other individual, who was a little in advance,
was concealed from the stranger's view. Presently,
however, a sudden movement occurred,
and disclosed his features, which were those
of a young man of nearly his own age. The</pp>
<pb n="124">
<pp>dress of this person was excessively showy,
and consisted of a scarlet riding&hyphen;habit, lined
and faced with blue, and bedizened with broad
gold lace, a green silk&hyphen;knit waistcoat, embroidered
with silver, and decorated with a deep
fringe, together with a hat tricked out in the
same gaudy style. His figure was slight, but
well&hyphen;built; and, in stature he did not exceed
five feet four. His complexion was pale; and
there was something sinister in the expression
of his large black eyes. His head was small
and bullet&hyphen;shaped, and he did not wear a wig,
but had his sleek black hair cut off closely
round his temples. A mutual recognition
took place at the same instant between the
stranger and this individual. Both started.
The latter seemed inclined to advance and address
the former; but suddenly changing his
mind, he shouted to his companion in tones
familiar to the stranger's ear; and, striking
spurs into his steed, dashed off at full speed
along the Edgeware Road. Impelled by a
feeling, into which we shall not pause to inquire,
the stranger started after them; but
they were better mounted, and soon distanced
him. Remarking that they struck off at a</pp>
<pb n="125">
<pp>turning on the left, he took the same road,
and soon found himself on Paddington&hyphen;Green.
A row of magnificent, and even then venerable,
elms threw their broad arms over this pleasant
spot. From a man, who was standing beneath
the shade of one of these noble trees, information
was obtained that the horsemen had
ridden along the Harrow Road. With a faint
view of overtaking them, the pursuer urged
his steed to a quicker pace. Arrived at Westbourne
&hyphen;Green&mdash;then nothing more than a
common covered with gorse and furzebushes,
and boasting only a couple of cottages and an
alehouse&mdash;he perceived through the hedges
the objects of his search slowly ascending the
gentle hill that rises from Kensall&hyphen;Green.</pp></p>
<p><pp>By the time he had reached the summit of
this hill, he had lost all trace of them; and
the ardour of the chase having in some measure
subsided, he began to reproach himself
for his folly, in having wandered&mdash;as he conceived
&mdash;so far out of his course. Before retracing
his steps, however, he allowed his gaze
to range over the vast and beautiful prospect
spread out beneath him, which is now hidden
from the traveller's view by the high walls of</pp>
<pb n="126">
<pp>the General Cemetery, and can, consequently,
only be commanded from the interior of that
attractive place of burial,&mdash;and which, before
it was intersected by canals and railroads, and
portioned out into hippodromes, was exquisite
indeed. After feasting his eye upon this
superb panorama, he was about to return,
when he ascertained from a farmer that his
nearest road to Willesden would be down a
lane a little further on, to the right. Following
this direction, he opened a gate, and struck
into one of the most beautiful green lanes
imaginable; which, after various windings,
conducted him into a more frequented road,
and eventually brought him to the place he
sought. Glancing at the finger&hyphen;post over the
cage, which has been described as situated at
the outskirts of the village, and seeing no direction
to Dollis Hill, he made fresh inquiries
as to where it lay, from an elderly man, who
was standing with another countryman near
the little prison.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose house do you want, master?&rdquo; said
the man, touching his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wood's,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;There is Dollis Hill,&rdquo; said the man, pointing</pp>
<pb n="127">
<pp>to a well&hyphen;wooded eminence about a mile
distant, &ldquo;and there,&rdquo; he added, indicating
the roof of a house just visible above a grove
of trees &ldquo;is Mr. Wood's. If you ride past
the church, and mount the hill, you'll come
to Neasdon, and then you'll not have above
half a mile to go.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>The young man thanked his informant, and
was about to follow his instructions, when the
other called after him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, master, did you ever hear tell of
Mr. Wood's famous prentice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What apprentice?&rdquo; asked the stranger, in
surprise.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Why, Jack Sheppard, the notorious
house&hyphen;breaker,&mdash;him as has robbed half Lunnun, to
be sure. You must know, sir, when he was
a lad, the day after he broke into his master's
house in Wych Street, he picked a gentleman's
pocket in our church, during sarvice time,&mdash; 
that he did, the heathen. The gentleman
catched him i' th' fact, and we shut him up
for safety i' that pris'n. But,&rdquo; said the fellow,
with a laugh, &ldquo;he soon contrived to make his
way out on it, though. Ever since he's become
so famous, the folks about here ha' christened</pp>
<pb n="128">
<pp>it Jack Sheppard's cage. His mother used
to live i' this village, just down yonder; but
when her son took to bad ways, she went distracted,
&mdash;and now she 's i' Bedlam, I've
heerd.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell e'e what, John Dump,&rdquo; said the
other fellow, who had hitherto preserved
silence, &ldquo;I don't know whether you talkin'
o' Jack Sheppard has put him into my head
or not; but I once had him pointed out to me,
and if that <it>were</it> him as I seed then, he's just
now ridden past us, and put up at the Six
Bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce he has!&rdquo; cried Dump. &ldquo;If
you were sure o' that we might seize him, and
get the reward for his apprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That'ud be no such easy matter,&rdquo; replied
the countryman. &ldquo;Jack's a desperate fellow,
and is always well armed; besides, he has a
comrade with him. But I'll tell e'e what we
<it>might</it> do&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>The young man heard no more. Taking
the direction pointed out, he rode off. As he
passed the Six Bells, he noticed the steeds of
the two horsemen at the door; and glancing
into the house, perceived the younger of the</pp>
<pb n="129">
<pp>two in the passage. The latter no sooner
beheld him than he dashed hastily into an
adjoining room. After debating with himself
whether he should further seek an interview,
which, though now in his power, was so sedulously
shunned by the other party, he decided
in the negative; and contenting himself with
writing upon a slip of paper the hasty words,&mdash; 
&ldquo;You are known by the villagers,&mdash;be upon
your guard,&rdquo;&mdash;he gave it to the ostler, with
instructions to deliver it instantly to the owner
of the horse he pointed out, and pursued his
course.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Passing the old rectory, and still older
church, with its reverend screen of trees, and
slowly ascending a hill side, from whence he
obtained enchanting peeps of the spire and
college of Harrow, he reached the cluster of
well&hyphen;built houses which constitute the village
of Neasdon. From this spot a road, more
resembling the drive through a park than a
public thoroughfare, led him gradually to the
brow of Dollis Hill. It was a serene and
charming evening, and twilight was gently
stealing over the face of the country. Bordered
by fine timber, the road occasionally</pp>
<pb n="130">
<pp>offered glimpses of a lovely valley, until a
wider opening gave a full view of a delightful
and varied prospect. On the left lay the
heights of Hampstead, studded villas, while
farther off a hazy cloud marked the position
of the metropolis. The stranger concluded he
could not be far from his destination, and a
turn in the road showed him the house.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Beneath two tall elms, whose boughs completely
overshadowed the roof, stood Mr.
Wood's dwelling,&mdash;a plain, substantial, commodious
farmhouse. On a bench at the foot
of the trees, with a pipe in his mouth, and a
tankard by his side, sat the worthy carpenter,
looking the picture of good&hyphen;heartedness and
benevolence. The progress of time was marked
in Mr. Wood by increased corpulence and
decreased powers of vision,&mdash;by deeper
wrinkles and higher shoulders, by scantier
breath and a fuller habit. Still he looked
hale and hearty, and the country life he led
had imparted a ruddier glow to his cheek.
Around him were all the evidences of plenty.
A world of hay&hyphen;stacks, bean&hyphen;stacks, and straw&hyphen;ricks
flanked the granges adjoining his habitation; 
the yard was crowded with poultry,</pp>
<pb n="131">
<pp>pigeons were feeding at his feet, cattle were
being driven towards the stall, horses led to
the stable, a large mastiff was rattling his
chain, and stalking majestically in front of his
kennel, while a number of farming&hyphen;men were
passing and repassing about their various occupations.
At the back of the house, on a
bank, rose an old&hyphen;fashioned terrace&hyphen;garden,
full of apple&hyphen;trees and other fruit&hyphen;trees in
blossom, and lively with the delicious verdure
of early spring.</pp></p>
<p>Hearing the approach of the rider, Mr.
Wood turned to look at him. It was now
getting dusk, and he could only imperfectly
distinguish the features and figure of the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not ask whether this is Mr.
Wood's,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;since I find him
at his own gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; said the worthy carpenter,
rising. &ldquo;I am Owen Wood, at your
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not remember me, I dare say,&rdquo; 
observed the stranger.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I can't say I do,&rdquo; replied Wood. &ldquo;Your
voice seems familiar to me&mdash;and&mdash;but I'm</pp>
<pb n="132">
<pp>getting a little deaf&mdash;and my eyes don't serve
me quite so well as they used to do, especially
by this light.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; returned the stranger, dismounting; 
&ldquo;you'll recollect me by and by,
I've no doubt. I bring you tidings of an old
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you're heartily welcome, sir, whoever
you are. Pray, walk in. Here, Jem, take
the gentleman's horse to the stable&mdash;see him
dressed and fed directly. Now, sir, will you
please to follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wood then led the way up a rather
high and, according to modern notions, incommodious
flight of steps, and introduced
his guest to a neat parlour, the windows of
which were darkened by pots of flowers and
creepers. There was no light in the room; 
but, notwithstanding this, the young man
did not fail to detect the buxom figure of Mrs.
Wood, now more buxom and more gorgeously
arrayed than ever,&mdash;as well as a young and
beautiful female, in whom he was at no loss
to recognise the carpenter's daughter.</p>
<p><pp>Winifred Wood was now in her twentieth
year. Her features were still slightly marked</pp>
<pb n="133">
<pp>by the disorder alluded to in the description of
her as a child,&mdash;but that was the only drawback
to her beauty. Their expression was so amiable,
that it would have redeemed a countenance
a thousand times plainer than hers. Her
figure was perfect,&mdash;tall, graceful, rounded,&mdash; 
and, then, she had deep liquid blue eyes, that
rivalled the stars in lustre. On the stranger's
appearance, she was seated near the window
busily occupied with her needle.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife and daughter, sir,&rdquo; said the carpenter,
introducing them to his guest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wood, whose admiration for masculine
beauty was by no means abated, glanced at the
well&hyphen;proportioned figure of the young man, and
made him a very civil salutation. Winifred's
reception was kind, but more distant, and after
the slight ceremonial she resumed her occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman brings us tidings of an old
friend, my dear,&rdquo; said the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, indeed! And who may that be?&rdquo; inquired
his wife.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;One whom you may perhaps have forgotten,&rdquo; 
replied the stranger, &ldquo;but who can
never forget the kindness he experienced at</pp>
<pb n="134">
<pp>your hands, or at those of your excellent husband.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>At the sound of his voice every vestige of
colour fled from Winifred's cheeks, and the
work upon which she was engaged fell from her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a token to deliver to you,&rdquo; continued
the stranger, addressing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; gasped Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This locket,&rdquo; he said, taking a little ornament
attached to a black ribband from his breast,
and giving it her,&mdash;&ldquo;do you remember it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;I do!&rdquo; cried Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's all this?&rdquo; exclaimed Wood in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know me, father?&rdquo; said the
young man, advancing towards him, and warmly
grasping his hand. &ldquo;Have nine years so
changed me, that there is no trace left of your
adopted son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; ejaculated the carpenter,
rubbing his eyes, &ldquo;can&mdash;can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Wood, joining the
group, &ldquo;it isn't Thames Darrell come to life
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It is&mdash;it is!&rdquo; cried Winifred, rushing</pp>
<pb n="135">
<pp>towards him, and flinging her arms round his
neck,&mdash;&ldquo;it is my dear&mdash;dear brother!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is what I never expected to see,&rdquo; 
said the carpenter, wiping his eyes; &ldquo;I hope
I'm not dreaming! Thames, my dear boy, as
soon as Winny has done with you, let me embrace you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My turn comes before yours, sir,&rdquo; interposed
his better half. &ldquo;Come to my arms,
Thames! Oh! dear! Oh! dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>To repeat the questions and congratulations
which now ensued, or describe the extravagant
joy of the carpenter, who, after he had hugged
his adopted son to his breast with such warmth
as almost to squeeze the breath from his body,
capered around the room, threw his wig into
the empty fire&hyphen;grate, and committed various
other fantastic actions, in order to get rid of
his superfluous satisfaction&mdash;to describe the
scarcely less extravagant raptures of his spouse,
or the more subdued, but not less heartfelt delight
of Winifred, would be a needless task, as
it must occur to every one's imagination. Supper
was quickly served; the oldest bottle of
wine was brought from the cellar; the strongest
barrel of ale was tapped; but not one of the</pp>
<pb n="136">
<pp>party could eat or drink&mdash;their hearts were too
full.</pp></p>
<p>Thames sat with Winifred's hand clasped in
his own, and commenced a recital of his adventures,
which may be briefly told. Carried
out to sea by Van Galgebrok, and thrown overboard,
while struggling with the waves, he had
been picked up by a French fishing&hyphen;boat, and
carried to Ostend. After encountering various
hardships and privations for a long time, during
which he had no means of communicating with
England, he, at length, found his way to Paris,
where he was taken notice of by Cardinal
Dubois, who employed him as one of his
secretaries, and subsequently advanced to the
service of Philip of Orleans, from whom he
received a commission. On the death of his
royal patron, he resolved to return to his own
country; and, after various delays, which had
postponed it to the present time, he had succeeded
in accomplishing his object.</p>
<p>Winifred listened to his narration with the
profoundest attention; and, when it concluded,
her tearful eye and throbbing bosom told how
deeply her feelings had been interested.</p>
<p><pp>The discourse, then, turned to Darrell's old</pp>
<pb n="137">
<pp>playmate, Jack Sheppard; and Mr. Wood, in
deploring his wild career, adverted to the melancholy
condition to which it had reduced his
mother.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part, it's only what I expected of
him,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Wood, and I'm sorry and
surprised he hasn't swung for his crimes before
this. The gallows has groaned for him for
years. As to his mother, I've no pity for her.
She deserves what has befallen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother, don't say so,&rdquo; returned
Winifred. &ldquo;One of the consequences of criminal
conduct, is the shame and disgrace which
&mdash;worse than any punishment the evil&hyphen;doer can
suffer&mdash;is brought by it upon the innocent relatives; 
and, if Jack had considered this, perhaps
he would not have acted as he has done,
and have entailed so much misery on his unhappy
parent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always detested Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; cried
the carpenter's wife bitterly; &ldquo;and, I repeat,
Bedlam's too good for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; observed Wood, &ldquo;you should
be more charitable&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Charitable!&rdquo; repeated his wife, &ldquo;that's
your constant cry. Marry, come up! I've</pp>
<pb n="138">
<pp>been a great deal too charitable. Here's Winny
always urging you to go and visit Mrs. Sheppard
in the asylum, and take her this, and send
her that;&mdash;and I've never prevented you, though
such mistaken liberality's enough to provoke a
saint. And, then, forsooth, she must needs
prevent your hanging Jack Sheppard after the
robbery in Wych&hyphen;Street, when you might have
done so. Perhaps you'll call that charity: <it>I</it>
call it defeating the ends of justice. See what
a horrible rascal you've let loose upon the
world!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure, mother,&rdquo; rejoined Winifred, &ldquo;if
any one was likely to feel resentment, I was; 
for no one could be more frightened. But I
was sorry for poor Jack&mdash;as I am still, and
hoped he would mend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mend!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Wood, contemptuously,
&ldquo;he'll never mend till he comes to
Tyburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;At least, I will hope so,&rdquo; returned Winifred.
&ldquo;But, as I was saying, I was most
dreadfully frightened on the night of the robbery.
Though so young at the time, I remember
every circumstance distinctly. I was sitting
up, lamenting your departure, dear Thames,</pp>
<pb n="139">
<pp>when, hearing an odd noise, I went to the
landing, and, by the light of a dark lantern, saw
Jack Sheppard stealing up stairs, followed by
two men with crape on their faces. I'm ashamed
to say that I was too much terrified to scream
out&mdash;but ran and hid myself.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wood. I
declare you throw me into an ague. Do you
think <it>I</it> forget it? Didn't they help themselves
to all the plate and the money&mdash;to several of
my best dresses, and, amongst others, to my
favourite kincob gown; and I've never been
able to get another like it! Marry, come up!
I'd hang 'em all, if I could. Were such a
thing to happen again, I'd never let Mr.
Wood rest till he brought the villains to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope such a thing never <it>will</it> happen
again, my dear,&rdquo; observed Wood, mildly; &ldquo;but,
when it does, it will be time to consider what
course we ought to pursue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them attempt it, if they dare!&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Wood, who had worked herself into a passion; 
&ldquo;and, I'll warrant 'em, the boldest robber
among 'em shall repent it, if he comes across
me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="140">
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, my dear,&rdquo; acquiesced the carpenter,
&ldquo;no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thames, who had been more than once on
the point of mentioning his accidental rencounter
with Jack Sheppard, not being altogether
without apprehension, from the fact of his
being in the neighbourhood,&mdash;now judged it
more prudent to say nothing on the subject,
from a fear of increasing Mrs. Wood's displeasure; 
and he was the more readily induced to
do this, as the conversation began to turn upon
his own affairs. Mr. Wood could give him no
further information respecting Sir Rowland
Trenchard than what he had obtained from
Kneebone; but begged him to defer the further
consideration of the line of conduct he
meant to pursue until the morrow, when he
hoped to have a plan to lay before him, of
which he would approve.</p>
<p>The night was now advancing, and the party
began to think of separating. As Mrs. Wood,
who had recovered her good humour, quitted
the room, she bestowed a hearty embrace on
Thames, and she told him, laughingly, that she
would &ldquo;defer all <it>she</it> had to propose to him
until to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="141">
<p>To&hyphen;morrow! She never beheld it.</p>
<p>After an affectionate parting with Winifred,
Thames was conducted by the carpenter to his
sleeping apartment&mdash;a comfortable cosy chamber; 
such a one, in short, as can only be met
with in the country, with its dimity&hyphen;curtained
bed, its sheets fragrant of lavender, its clean
white furniture, and an atmosphere breathing
of freshness. Left to himself, he took a survey
of the room, and his heart leaped as he
beheld over the chimney&hyphen;piece, a portrait of
himself. It was a copy of the pencil sketch
taken of him nine years ago by Winifred, and
awakened a thousand tender recollections.</p>
<p><pp>When about to retire to rest, the rencounter
with Jack Sheppard again recurred to him, and
he half blamed himself for not acquainting
Mr. Wood with the circumstances, and putting
him upon his guard against the possibility of
an attack. On weighing the matter over, he
grew so uneasy that he resolved to descend,
and inform him of his misgivings. But, when
he got to the door with this intention, he became
ashamed of his fears; and feeling convinced
that Jack&mdash;bad as he might be&mdash;was
not capable of such atrocious conduct as to</pp>
<pb n="142">
<pp>plunder his benefactor twice, he contented himself
with looking to the priming of his pistols,
and placing them near him, to be ready in case
of need, he threw himself on the bed, and
speedily fell asleep.</pp></p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Thames Darrell's</smallcap> fears were not, however
groundless. Danger, in the form he
apprehended, was lurking outside: nor was he
destined to enjoy long repose. On receiving
the warning note from the ostler, Jack Sheppard
and his companion left Willesden, and
taking&mdash;as a blind&mdash;the direction of Harrow,
returned at night&hyphen;fall by a by&hyphen;lane to Neasdon,
and put up at a little public&hyphen;house called the
Spotted Dog. Here they remained till midnight
when, calling for their reckoning and their
steeds, they left the house.</p>
<p>It was a night well&hyphen;fitted to their enterprise,
calm, still, and profoundly dark. As they
passed beneath the thick trees that shade the
road to Dollis Hill, the gloom was almost impenetrable.
The robbers proceeded singly,
and kept on the grass skirting the road, so
that no noise was made by their horses' feet.</p>
<pb n="144">
<p>As they neared the house, Jack Sheppard,
who led the way, halted, and addressed his
companion in a low voice:&mdash;</p>
<lb><p>&ldquo;I don't half like this job, Blueskin,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;it always went against the grain. But,
since I've seen the friend and companion of
my childhood, Thames Darrell, I've no heart
for it. Shall we turn back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And disappoint Mr. Wild, captain?&rdquo; remonstrated
the other, in a deferential tone.
&ldquo;You know this is a pet project. It might be
dangerous to thwart him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; cried Jack: &ldquo;I don't value his
anger a straw. All our fraternity are afraid of
him; but <it>I</it> laugh at his threats. He daren't
quarrel with me: and if he does, let him look
to himself. I've my own reasons for disliking
this job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know I always act under your
orders, captain,&rdquo; returned Blueskin; &ldquo;and if
you give the word to retreat, I shall obey, of
course: but I know what Edgeworth Bess will
say when we go home empty&hyphen;handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what will she say?&rdquo; inquired Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we were afraid,&rdquo; replied the other; 
&ldquo;but never mind her.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="145">
<p>&ldquo;Ay; but I do mind her,&rdquo; cried Jack, upon
whom his comrade's observation had produced
the desired effect. &ldquo;We'll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's right, captain,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin.
&ldquo;You pledged yourself to Mr. Wild&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; interrupted Jack; and I never yet
broke an engagement. Though a thief, Jack
Sheppard is a man of his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure he is,&rdquo; acquiesced Blueskin.
&ldquo;I should like to meet the man who would
dare to gainsay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word before we begin, Blueskin,&rdquo; 
said Jack, authoritatively; &ldquo;in case the family
should be alarmed&mdash;mind, no violence. There's
one person in the house whom I wouldn't
frighten for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood's daughter, I suppose?&rdquo; observed
the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've hit it,&rdquo; answered Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you to carrying her off, captain?&rdquo; 
suggested Blueskin. &ldquo;If you've a
fancy for the girl, we might do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;Bess wouldn't
bear a rival. But if you wish to do old Wood
a friendly turn, you may bring off his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I shouldn't mind ridding him of her,&rdquo; said</pp>
<pb n="146">
<pp>Blueskin, gruffly; &ldquo;and if she comes in my
way, may the devil seize me if I don't make
short work with her!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; rejoined Jack, sternly, &ldquo;I've
just said I'll have no violence&mdash;mind that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>With this, they dismounted; and fastening
their horses to a tree, proceeded towards the
house. It was still so dark, that nothing could
be distinguished except the heavy masses of
timber by which the premises were surrounded; 
but as they advanced, lights were visible in
some of the windows. Presently they came to
a wall, on the other side of which the dog began
to bark violently; but Blueskin tossed him
a piece of prepared meat, and uttering a low
growl, he became silent. They then clambered
over a hedge, and scaling another wall, got into
the garden at the back of the house. Treading
with noiseless step over the soft mould, they
soon reached the building. Arrived there, Jack
felt about for a particular window; and having
discovered the object of his search, and received
the necessary implements from his companion,
he instantly commenced operations. In
a few seconds, the shutter flew open,&mdash;then
the window,&mdash;and they were in the room.</pp>
<pb n="147">
<pp>Jack now carefully closed the shutters, while
Blueskin struck a light, with which he set fire
to a candle. The room they were in was a
sort of closet, with the door locked outside; 
but this was only a moment's obstacle to Jack,
who with a chisel forced back the bolt. The
operation was effected with so much rapidity
and so little noise, that even if any one had
been on the alert, he could scarcely have detected
it. They then took off their boots, and
crept stealthily up stairs, treading upon the
point of their toes so cautiously, that not a
board creaked beneath their weight. Pausing
at each door on the landing, Jack placed his
ear to the key&hyphen;hole, and listened intently.
Having ascertained by the breathing which
room Thames occupied, he speedily contrived
to fasten him in. He then tried the door of
Mr. Wood's bedchamber&mdash;it was locked, with
the key left in it. This occasioned a little delay; 
but Jack, whose skill as a workman in
the particular line he had chosen was unequalled,
and who laughed at difficulties, speedily
cut out a panel by means of a centre&hyphen;bit and
knife, took the key from the other side, and
unlocked the door. Covering his face with a</pp>
<pb n="148">
<pp>crape mask, and taking the candle from his
associate, Jack entered the room; and, pistol
in hand, stepped up to the bed, and approached
the light to the eyes of the sleepers. The loud
noise proceeding from the couch proved that
their slumbers were deep and real; and unconscious
of the danger in which she stood,
Mrs. Wood turned over to obtain a more comfortable
position. During this movement, Jack
grasped the barrel of his pistol, held in his
breath, and motioned to Blueskin, who bared a
long knife, to keep still. The momentary
alarm over, he threw a piece of wash leather
over a bureau, so as to deaden the sound, and
instantly broke it open with a small crow&hyphen;bar.
While he was filling his pockets with golden
coin from this store, Blueskin had pulled the
plate&hyphen;chest from under the bed, and having
forced it open, began filling a canvass bag with
its contents,&mdash;silver coffee&hyphen;pots, chocolate&hyphen;dishes,
waiters, trays, tankards, goblets, and
candlesticks. It might be supposed that these
articles, when thrust together into the bag,
would have jingled; but these skilful practitioners
managed matters so well that no noise
was made. After rifling the room of everything</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>294Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010116">
<pb n="149">
<pp>portable, including some of Mrs. Wood's
ornaments and wearing apparel, they prepared
to depart. Jack then intimated his intention
of visiting Winifred's chamber, in which several
articles of value were known to be kept; 
but as, notwithstanding his reckless character,
he still retained a feeling of respect for the object
of his boyish affections, he would not
suffer Blueskin to accompany him, so he commanded
him to keep watch over the sleepers&mdash; 
strictly enjoining him, however, to do them no
injury. Again having recourse to the centrebit,
&mdash;for Winifred's door was locked,&mdash;Jack
had nearly cut out a panel, when a sudden outcry
was raised in the carpenter's chamber.
The next moment, a struggle was heard, and
Blueskin appeared at the door, followed by
Mrs. Wood.</pp></p>
<p>Jack instantly extinguished the light, and
called to his comrade to come after him.</p>
<p>But Blueskin found it impossible to make
off,&mdash;at least with the spoil,&mdash;Mrs. Wood
having laid hold of the canvass&hyphen;bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give back the things!&rdquo; cried the lady.
&ldquo;Help!&mdash;help, Mr. Wood!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="150">
<p>&ldquo;Leave go! thundered Blueskin&mdash;&ldquo;leave
go&mdash;you'd better!&rdquo;&mdash;and he held the sack
as firmly as he could with one hand, while with
the other he searched for his knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won't leave go!&rdquo; screamed Mrs.
Wood. &ldquo;Fire!&mdash;murder&mdash;thieves!&mdash;I've
got one of 'em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't,&rdquo; answered Blueskin. &ldquo;This shedevil
has got hold of the sack. Leave go, I
tell you!&rdquo; and he forced open the knife with
his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&mdash;murder!&mdash;thieves!&rdquo; screamed
Mrs. Wood;&mdash;&ldquo;Owen&mdash;Owen!&mdash;Thames,
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wood, leaping from
the bed. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Wood. &ldquo;Help&mdash; 
I'll hold him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave her,&rdquo; cried Jack, darting down
stairs, amid a furious ringing of bells,&mdash;&ldquo;the
house is alarmed,&mdash;follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curses light on you!&rdquo; cried Blueskin,
savagely; &ldquo;since you won't be advised, take
your fate.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="151">
<p>And seizing her by the hair, he pulled back
her head, and drew the knife with all his force
across her throat. There was a dreadful stifled
groan, and she fell heavily upon the landing.</p>
<p><pp>The screams of the unfortunate woman had
aroused Thames from his slumbers. Snatching
up his pistols, he rushed to the door, but
to his horror found it fastened. He heard the
struggle on the landing, the fall of the heavy
body, the groan,&mdash;and excited almost to
frenzy by his fears, he succeeded in forcing
open the door. By this time, several of the
terrified domestics appeared with lights. A
terrible spectacle was presented to the young
man's gaze:&mdash;the floor deluged with blood
&mdash;the mangled and lifeless body of Mrs.
Wood,&mdash;Winifred fainted in the arms of a
female attendant,&mdash;and Wood standing beside
them almost in a state of distraction. Thus, in
a few minutes, had this happy family been
plunged into the depths of misery. At this
juncture, a cry was raised by a servant from
below, that the robbers were flying through
the garden. Darting to a window looking in
that direction, Thames threw it up, and discharged</pp>
<pb n="152">
<pp>both his pistols, but without effect.
In another minute, the tramp of horses' feet
told that the perpetrators of the outrage had
effected their escape.</pp></p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Scarcely</smallcap> an hour after the horrible occurrence
just related, as Jonathan Wild was seated
in the audience&hyphen;chamber of his residence at
the Old Bailey, occupied, like Peachum, (for
whose portrait he sat,) with his account&hyphen;books
and registers, he was interrupted by the sudden
entrance of Quilt Arnold, who announced
Jack Sheppard and Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Wild, laying down his pen
and looking up with a smile of satisfaction.
&ldquo;I was just thinking of you Jack. What news.
Have you done the trick at Dollis Hill?&mdash; 
brought off the swag&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo; answered Jack, flinging himself sullenly
into a chair, &ldquo;I've not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why how's this?&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan.
&ldquo;Jack Sheppard failed! I'd not believe it, if
any one but himself told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've not failed,&rdquo; returned Jack, angrily; 
&ldquo;but we've done too much.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="154">
<p>&ldquo;I'm no reader of riddles,&rdquo; said Jonathan.
&ldquo;Speak plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let this speak for me,&rdquo; said Sheppard,
tossing a heavy bag of money towards him.
&ldquo;You can generally understand that language.
There's more than I undertook to bring. It
has been purchased by blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! have you cut old Wood's throat?&rdquo; 
asked Wild, with great unconcern, as he took
up the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I <it>had</it>, you'd not have seen me here,&rdquo; 
replied Jack, sullenly. &ldquo;The blood that has
been spilt is that of his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was her own fault,&rdquo; observed Blueskin,
moodily. &ldquo;She wouldn't let me go. I did it
in self&hyphen;defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care not why you did it,&rdquo; said Jack,
sternly. &ldquo;We work together no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, captain,&rdquo; remonstrated Blueskin.
&ldquo;I thought you'd have got rid of your
ill&hyphen;humour by this time. You know as well as
I do that it was accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accident or not,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard; 
&ldquo;you're no longer pal of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;And so this is my reward for having made
you the tip&hyphen;top cracksman you are,&rdquo; muttered</pp>
<pb n="155">
<pp>Blueskin;&mdash;&ldquo;to be turned off at a moment's
notice, because I silenced a noisy woman. It's
too hard. Think better of it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind's made up,&rdquo; rejoined Jack,
coldly,&mdash;&ldquo;we part to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll not go,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;I love
you like a son, and will follow you like a dog.
You'd not know what to do without me, and
shan't drive me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; remarked Jonathan, who had paid
little attention to the latter part of the conversation; 
&ldquo;this is an awkward business certainly; 
but we must do the best we can in it.
You must keep out of the way till it's blown
over. I can accommodate you below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't require it,&rdquo; returned Sheppard.
&ldquo;I'm tired of the life I'm leading. I shall
quit it and go abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll go with you,&rdquo; said Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before either of you go, you will ask my
permission,&rdquo; said Jonathan, coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; exclaimed Sheppard. &ldquo;Do you
mean to say you will interfere&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I mean to say this,&rdquo; interrupted Wild,
with contemptuous calmness, &ldquo;that I'll
neither allow you to leave England nor the</pp>
<pb n="156">
<pp>profession you've engaged in. I would'nt
allow you to be honest even if you could be so,
&mdash;which I doubt. You are my slave&mdash;and
such you shall continue.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Slave?&rdquo; echoed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare to disobey,&rdquo; continued Jonathan:
&ldquo;neglect my orders, and I will hang you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheppard started to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me,&rdquo; he cried, restraining himself
with difficulty. &ldquo;It is time you should know
whom you have to deal with. Henceforth, I
utterly throw off the yoke you have laid upon
me. I will neither stir hand nor foot for you
more. Attempt to molest me, and I split.
You are more in my power than I am in yours.
Jack Sheppard is a match for Jonathan Wild,
any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he is,&rdquo; added Blueskin, approvingly.</p>
<p>Jonathan smiled contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One motive alone shall induce me to go on
with you,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youth whom you delivered to Van&hyphen;Galgebrok,
&mdash;Thames Darrell, is returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Jonathan. &ldquo;He was
thrown overboard, and perished at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="157">
<p>&ldquo;He is alive,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;I have seen
him, and might have conversed with him if I
had chosen. Now, I know you can restore
him to his rights, if you choose. Do so; and
I am yours as heretofore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your answer!&rdquo; cried Sheppard. &ldquo;Yes,
or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make no terms with you,&rdquo; rejoined
Wild, sternly. &ldquo;You have defied me, and
shall feel my power. You have been useful to
me, or I would not have spared you thus long.
I swore to hang you two years ago, but I deferred
my purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deferred!&rdquo; echoed Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me out,&rdquo; said Jonathan. &ldquo;You
came hither under my protection, and you shall
depart freely,&mdash;nay, more, you shall have an
hour's grace. After that time, I shall place my
setters on your heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot prevent my departure,&rdquo; replied
Jack, dauntlessly, &ldquo;and therefore your
offer is no favour. But I tell you in return,
I shall take no pains to hide myself. If you
want me, you know where to find me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="158">
<p>&ldquo;An hour,&rdquo; said Jonathan, looking at his
watch,&mdash;&ldquo;remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you send for me to the Cross Shovels
in the Mint, where I'm going with Blueskin,
I will surrender myself without resistance,&rdquo; 
returned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will spare the officers a labour then,&rdquo; 
rejoined Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't I settle this business, captain,&rdquo; muttered
Blueskin, drawing a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't harm him,&rdquo; said Jack, carelessly:
&ldquo;he dares not do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blueskin,&rdquo; said Jonathan, as that worthy
was about to follow, &ldquo;I advise you to remain
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the ruffian, moodily. &ldquo;If
you arrest him, you must arrest me also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said Jonathan, seating himself.</p>
<p><pp>Jack and his comrade went to the Mint,
where he was joined by Edgeworth Bess, with
whom he sat down most unconcernedly to
supper. His revelry, however, was put an
end to at the expiration of the time mentioned</pp>
<pb n="159">
<pp>by Jonathan, by the entrance of a posse of constables
with Quilt Arnold and Abraham Mendez
at their head. Jack, to the surprise of all
his companions, at once surrendered himself:
but Blueskin would have made a fierce resistance,
and attempted a rescue if he had not
been ordered by his leader to desist. He then
made off. Edgeworth Bess, who passed for
Sheppard's wife, was secured. They were hurried
before a magistrate, and charged by Jonathan
Wild with various robberies; but, as
Jack Sheppard stated that he had most important
disclosures to make, as well as charges
to bring forward against his accuser, he was
committed with his female companion to the
New Prison in Clerkenwell for further examination.</pp></p></div4>

<subhead>JACK SHEPPARD'S ESCAPE FROM THE NEW PRISON.</subhead> <attbytes>8Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030651</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard.

<p><pp><smallcap>In</smallcap> consequence of Jack Sheppard's desperate
character, it was judged expedient by the
keeper of the New Prison to load him with
fetters of unusual weight, and to place him in
a cell which, from its strength and security, was
called the Newgate Ward. The ward in which
he was confined, was about six yards in length,
and three in width, and in height, might be
about twelve feet. The windows which were
about nine feet from the floor, had no glass; 
but were secured by thick iron bars, and
an oaken beam. Along the floor ran an
iron bar to which Jack's chain was attached,
so that he could move along it from
one end of the chamber to the other. No
prisoner except Edgeworth Bess was placed in
the same cell with him. Jack was in excellent
spirits; and by his wit, drollery, and agreeable
demeanour, speedily became a great favourite</pp>
<pb n="161">
<pp>with the turnkey, who allowed him every indulgence
consistent with his situation. The
report of his detention caused an immense
sensation. Numberless charges were preferred
against him, amongst others, information was
lodged of the robbery at Dollis Hill, and
murder of Mrs. Wood, and a large reward
offered for the apprehension of Blueskin; and
as, in addition to this, Jack had threatened to
impeach Wild, his next examination was
looked forward to with the greatest interest.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The day before this examination was appointed
to take place&mdash;the third of the prisoner's
detention&mdash;an old man, respectably
dressed, requested permission to see him.
Jack's friends were allowed to visit him; but,
as he had openly avowed his intention of attempting
an escape, their proceedings were
narrowly watched. The old man was conducted
to Jack's cell by the turnkey, who
remained near him during the interview. He
appeared to be a stranger to the prisoner, and
the sole motive of his visit, curiosity. After
a brief conversation, which Sheppard sustained
with his accustomed liveliness, the old man
turned to Bess and addressed a few words of</pp>
<pb n="162">
<pp>common&hyphen;place gallantry to her. While this
was going on, Jack suddenly made a movement
which attracted the turnkey's attention; 
and during that interval the old man slipped
some articles wrapped in a handkerchief into
Bess's hands, who instantly secreted them in
her bosom. The turnkey looked round the
next moment, but the man&oelig;uvre escaped his
observation. After a little further discourse
the old man took his departure.</pp></p>
<p>Left alone with Edgeworth Bess, Jack burst
into a loud laugh of exultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blueskin's a friend in need,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His
disguise was capital; but I detected it in a
moment. Has he given you the tools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; replied Bess, producing the
handkerchief.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Sheppard, examining its
contents, which proved to be a file, a chisel,
two or three gimblets, and a piercer.
&ldquo;Jonathan Wild shall find it's not easy to
detain me. As sure as he's now living, I'll
pay him a visit in the Old Bailey before morning.
And then I'll pay off old scores. It's
almost worth while being sent to prison to
have the pleasure of escaping. I shall now be</pp>
<pb n="163">
<pp>able to test my skill.&rdquo; And running on in this
way, he carefully concealed the tools.</pp></p>
<p>Whether the turnkey entertained any suspicions
of the old man, Jack could not tell,
but that night he was more than usually rigorous
in his search; and having carefully
examiend the prisoners and finding nothing
to excite his suspicions, he departed tolerably
satisfied.</p>
<p><pp>As soon as he was certain he should be
disturbed no more, Jack set to work, and with
the aid of the file in less than an hour had
freed himself from his fetters. With Bess's assistance
he then climbed up to the window,
which, as has just been stated, was secured
by iron bars of great thickness crossed by a
stout beam of oak. The very sight of these
impediments, would have appalled a less courageous
spirit than Sheppard's&mdash;but nothing
could daunt him. To work then he went, and
with wonderful industry filed off two of the
iron bars. Just as he completed this operation,
the file broke. The oaken beam, nine
inches in thickness, was now the sole but most
formidable obstacle to his flight. With his</pp>
<pb n="164">
<pp>gimblet he contrived to bore a number
of holes so close together that at last one
end of the bar, being completely pierced
through, yielded; and pursuing the same plan
with the other extremity, it fell out altogether.</pp></p>
<p><pp>This last operation was so fatiguing, that for
a short time he was obliged to pause to recover
the use of his fingers. He then descended; 
and having induced Bess to take off some
part of her clothing, he tore the gown and
petticoat into shreds and twisted them into a
sort of rope which he fastened to the lower
bars of the window. With some difficulty he
contrived to raise her to the window, and with
still greater difficulty to squeeze her through it
&mdash;her bulk being much greater than his own.
He then made a sort of running noose, passed
it over her body, and taking firmly hold of the
bars, prepared to guide her descent. But
Bess could scarcely summon resolution enough
to hazard the experiment; and it was only on
Jack's urgent intreaties, and even threats, that
she could be prevailed on to trust herself to
the frail tenure of the rope he had prepared.</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>430Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010117">
<pb n="165">
<pp>At length, however, she threw herself off; and
Jack carefully guiding the rope she landed in
safety.</pp></p>
<p>The next moment he was by her side.</p>
<p>But the great point was still unaccomplished.
They had escaped from the New Prison, it is
true; but the wall of Clerkenwell Bridewell, by
which that jail was formerly surrounded, and
which was more than twenty feet high, and
protected by formidable and bristling <it>chevaux
de frise</it>, remained to be scaled. Jack, however,
had an expedient for mastering this difficulty.
He ventured to the great gates, and by inserting
his gimblets into the wood at intervals, so
as to form points upon which he could rest his
foot, he contrived to ascend them; and when at
the top, having fastened a portion of his dress to
the spikes, he managed, not without considerable
risk, to draw up his female companion.
Once over the iron spikes, Bess exhibited no
reluctance to be let down on the other side of
the wall. Having seen his mistress safe down,
Jack instantly descended, leaving the best part
of his clothes, as a memorial of his flight, to the
jailor.</p>
<p>And thus he effected his escape from the
New Prison.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>In</smallcap> a hollow in the meadows behind the
prison whence Jack Sheppard had escaped,&mdash; 
for, at this time, the whole of the now thickly&hyphen;peopled
district north of Clerkenwell Bridewell
was open country, stretching out in fertile
fields in the direction of Islington&mdash;and about
a quarter of a mile off, stood a solitary hovel,
known as Black Mary's Hole. This spot,
which still retains its name, acquired the appellation
from an old crone who lived there, and
who, in addition to a very equivocal character
for honesty, enjoyed the reputation of being a
witch. Without enquiring into the correctness
of the latter part of the story, it may be sufficient
to state, that Black Mary was a person
in whom Jack Sheppard thought he could confide,
and, as Edgeworth Bess was incapable of
much further exertion, he determined to leave
her in the old woman's care till the following</pp>
<pb n="167">
<pp>night, while he shifted for himself and fulfilled
his design&mdash;for, however rash or hazardous a
project might be, if once conceived, Jack always
executed it,&mdash;of visiting Jonathan Wild at
his house in the Old Bailey.</pp></p>
<p><pp>It was precisely two o'clock on the morning
of Whitmonday, the 25th of May 1724, when
the remarkable escape before detailed was completed:
and, though it wanted full two hours
to daybreak, the glimmer of a waning moon
prevented it from being totally dark. Casting
a hasty glance, as he was about to turn an
angle of the wall, at the great gates and upper
windows of the prison, and perceiving no symptoms
of pursuit, Jack proceeded towards the
hovel at a very deliberate pace, carefully assisting
his female companion over every obstacle in the
road, and bearing her in his arms when, as was
more than once the case, she sank from fright
and exhaustion. In this way he crossed one
or two public gardens and a bowling&hyphen;green,
&mdash;the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell then
abounded in such places of amusement,&mdash; 
passed the noted Ducking Pond, where Black
Mary had been frequently immersed; and,</pp>
<pb n="168">
<pp>striking off to the left across the fields, arrived
in a few minutes at his destination.</pp></p>
<p>Descending the hollow, or rather excavation,
&mdash;for it was an old disused clay&hyphen;pit, at the
bottom of which the cottage was situated,&mdash;he
speedily succeeded in arousing the ancient sibyl,
and having committed Edgeworth Bess to her
care, with a promise of an abundant reward in
case she watched diligently over her safety,
and attended to her comforts till his return,&mdash; 
to all which Black Mary readily agreed,&mdash;he
departed with a heart lightened of half its load.</p>
<p><pp>Jack's first object was to seek out Blueskin,
whom he had no doubt he should find at the
New Mint, at Wapping, for the Old Mint no
longer afforded a secure retreat to the robber; 
and, with this view, he made the best of his
way along a bye&hyphen;lane leading towards Hockley&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;Hole.
He had not proceeded far when
he was alarmed by the tramp of a horse, which
seemed to be rapidly approaching, and he had
scarcely time to leap the hedge and conceal
himself behind a tree, when a tall man, enveloped
in an ample cloak, with his hat pulled
over his brows, rode by at full speed. Another</pp>
<pb n="169">
<pp>horseman followed quickly at the heels of the
first; but just as he passed the spot where
Jack stood, his steed missed its footing, and
fell. Either ignorant of the accident, or heedless
of it, the foremost horseman pursued his
way without even turning his head.</pp></p>
<p>Conceiving the opportunity too favourable to
be lost, Jack sprang suddenly over the hedge,
and before the man, who was floundering on
the ground with one foot in the stirrup, could
extricate himself from his embarrassing position,
secured his pistols, which he drew from
the holsters, and held them to his head. The
fellow swore lustily, in a voice which Jack instantly
recognised as that of Quilt Arnold, and
vainly attempted to rise and draw his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; thundered Sheppard, putting the
muzzle of the pistol so close to the janizary's
car, that the touch of the cold iron made him
start, &ldquo;don't you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood and thunder!&rdquo; exclaimed Quilt,
opening his eyes with astonishment. &ldquo;It can't
be Captain Sheppard!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It <it>is</it>,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;and you had better
have met the devil on your road than me. Do
you remember what I said when you took me</pp>
<pb n="170">
<pp>at the Mint four days ago? I told you my turn
would come. It <it>has</it> come,&mdash;and sooner than
you expected.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;So I find, captain,&rdquo; rejoined Quilt, submissively; 
&ldquo;but you're too noble&hyphen;hearted to
take advantage of my situation. Besides, I
acted for others, and not for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied Sheppard, &ldquo;and therefore
I spare your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure you wouldn't injure me, captain,&rdquo; 
remarked Quilt, in a wheedling tone,
while he felt about for his sword; &ldquo;you're far
too brave to strike a fallen man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! traitor!&rdquo; cried Jack, who had noticed
the movement; &ldquo;make such another attempt,
and it shall cost you your life.&rdquo; So saying, he
unbuckled the belt to which the janizary's
hanger was attached, and fastened it to his own
girdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he continued, sternly, &ldquo;was it
your master who has just ridden by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Quilt, sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, then?&rdquo; demanded Jack. &ldquo;Speak,
or I fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you <it>will</it> have it, it's Sir Rowland
Trenchard.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="171">
<p>&ldquo;Sir Rowland Trenchard!&rdquo; echoed Jack, in
amazement. &ldquo;What are you doing with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a long story, captain, and I've no
breath to tell it,&mdash;unless you choose to release
me,&rdquo; rejoined Quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, then,&rdquo; said Jack, freeing his foot
from the stirrup. &ldquo;Now&mdash;begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quilt, however, seemed unwilling to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to proceed to extremities,&rdquo; 
continued Sheppard, again raising the
pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you force me to betray my
master's secrets,&rdquo; replied Quilt, sullenly, &ldquo;I've
ridden express to Manchester to deliver a message
to Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respecting Thames Darrell?&rdquo; observed
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how the devil did you happen to
guess that?&rdquo; cried the janizary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; replied Sheppard. &ldquo;I'm
glad to find I'm right. You informed Sir
Rowland that Thames Darrell was returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Exactly so;&rdquo; replied Quilt, &ldquo;and he instantly
decided upon returning to London with</pp>
<pb n="172">
<pp>me. We've ridden post all the way, and I'm
horribly tired, or you wouldn't have mastered
me so easily.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Jack, to whom an
idea had suddenly occurred. &ldquo;Now, sir, I'll
trouble you for your coat. I've left mine on
the spikes of the New Prison, and must borrow
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, surely you can't be in earnest, captain.
You wouldn't rob Mr. Wild's chief janizary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd rob Mr. Wild himself if I met him,&rdquo; 
retorted Jack. &ldquo;Come, off with it, sirrah, or
I'll blow out your brains, in the first place,
and strip you afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, rather than you should commit so
great a crime, captain, here it is,&rdquo; replied Quilt,
handing him the garment in question. &ldquo;Anything
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your waistcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds! captain, I shall get my death of
cold. I was in hopes you'd be content with
my hat and wig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall require them as well,&rdquo; rejoined
Sheppard; &ldquo;and your boots.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="173">
<p>&ldquo;My boots! Fire and fury! They won't
fit you; they are too large. Besides, how am
I to ride home without them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't distress yourself,&rdquo; returned Jack,
&ldquo;you shall walk. Now,&rdquo; he added, as his
commands were reluctantly obeyed, &ldquo;help me
on with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quilt knelt down, as if he meant to comply; 
but, watching his opportunity, he made a
sudden grasp at Sheppard's leg, with the intention
of overthrowing him.</p>
<p>But Jack was too nimble for him. Striking
out his foot, he knocked half a dozen teeth
down the janizary's throat; and, seconding the
kick with a blow on the head from the buttend
of the pistol, stretched him, senseless and
bleeding on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like master like man,&rdquo; observed Jack as
he rolled the inanimate body to the side of the
road. &ldquo;From Jonathan Wild's confidential
servant what could be expected but treachery?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>With this, he proceeded to dress himself in
Quilt Arnold's clothes, pulled the wig over his
face and eyes so as completely to conceal his
features, slouched the hat over his brows, drew</pp>
<pb n="174">
<pp>the huge boots above his knees, and muffled
himself up in the best way he could. On
searching the coat, he found, amongst other
matters, a mask, a key, and a pocket&hyphen;book.
The latter appeared to contain several papers,
which Jack carefully put by, in the hope that
they might turn out of importance in a scheme
of vengeance which he meditated against the
thieftaker. He then mounted the jaded hack,
which had long since regained its legs, and was
quietly browsing the grass at the road&hyphen;side, and,
striking spurs into its side, rode off. He had
not proceeded far when he encountered Sir
Rowland, who, having missed his attendant,
had returned to look after him.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;What has delayed you?&rdquo; demanded the
knight, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My horse has had a fall,&rdquo; replied Jack, assuming
to perfection&mdash;for he was a capital
mimic&mdash;the tones of Quilt Arnold. &ldquo;It was
some time before I could get him to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancied I heard voices,&rdquo; rejoined Sir
Rowland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; answered Jack; &ldquo;we had better
move on. This is a noted place for high&hyphen;waymen.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="175">
<p>&ldquo;I thought you told me that the rascal
who has so long been the terror of the town&mdash; 
Jack Sheppard&mdash;was in custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; returned Jack; &ldquo;but there's
no saying how long he may remain so. Besides,
there are greater rascals than Jack Sheppard
at liberty, Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Rowland made no reply, but angrily
quickened his pace. The pair then descended
Saffron&hyphen;hill, threaded Field&hyphen;lane, and, entering
Holborn, passed over the little bridge which
then crossed the muddy waters of Fleet&hyphen;ditch,
mounted Snow&hyphen;hill, and soon drew in the
bridle before Jonathan Wild's door. Aware of
Quilt Arnold's mode of proceeding, Jack instantly
dismounted, and, instead of knocking,
opened the door with the pass&hyphen;key. The
porter instantly made his appearance, and
Sheppard ordered him to take care of the
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what sort of journey have you had,
Quilt?&rdquo; asked the man as he hastened to assist
Sir Rowland to dismount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we've lost no time, as you perceive,&rdquo; 
replied Jack. &ldquo;Is the governor within?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="176">
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you'll find him in the audience&hyphen;chamber.
He has got Blueskin with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! indeed! what's he doing here?&rdquo; inquired
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to buy off Jack Sheppard, I suppose,&rdquo; 
replied the fellow. &ldquo;But it won't do.
Mr. Wild has made up his mind; and, when
that's the case, all the persuasion on earth
won't turn him. Jack will be tried to&hyphen;morrow; 
and, as sure as my name's Obadiah Lemon
he'll take up his quarters at the King's&hyphen;Head,&rdquo; 
pointing to Newgate, &ldquo;over the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Look
to the horses, Obadiah. This way, Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As familiar as Quilt Arnold himself with
every part of Wild's mysterious abode, as well
as with the ways of its inmates, Jack, without
a moment's hesitation, took up a lamp which
was burning in the hall, and led his companion
up the great stone stairs. Arrived at the audience&hyphen;chamber,
he set down the light upon a
stand, threw open the door, and announced in
a loud voice, but with the perfect intonation of
the person he represented,&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Rowland
Trenchard.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="177">
<p>Jonathan, who was engaged in conversation
with Blueskin, instantly arose, and bowed with
cringing ceremoniousness to the knight. The
latter haughtily returned his salutation, and
flung himself, as if exhausted, into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've arrived sooner than I expected,
Sir Rowland,&rdquo; observed the thieftaker. &ldquo;Lost
no time on the road&mdash;eh?&mdash;I didn't expect
you till to&hyphen;morrow at the earliest. Excuse me
an instant while I dismiss this person.&mdash;You've
your answer, Blueskin,&rdquo; he added, pushing
that individual, who seemed unwilling to depart,
towards the door; &ldquo;it's useless to urge
the matter further. Jack is registered in the
Black Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word before I go,&rdquo; urged Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a syllable,&rdquo; replied Wild. &ldquo;If you
talk as long as an Old Bailey counsel, you'll
not alter my determination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't my life do as well as his?&rdquo; supplicated
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan, doubtfully.
&ldquo;And you would surrender yourself&mdash; 
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I'll surrender myself at once, if you'll engage
to bring him off; and you'll get the reward</pp>
<pb n="178">
<pp>from old Wood. It's two hundred
pounds. Recollect that.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Faithful fellow!&rdquo; murmured Jack. &ldquo;I forgive
him his disobedience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do it?&rdquo; persisted Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Wild; &ldquo;and I've only listened
to your absurd proposal to see how far
your insane attachment to this lad would
carry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>do</it> love him,&rdquo; cried Blueskin, &ldquo;and
that's the long and short of it. I've taught
him all he can do; and there isn't his fellow,
and never will be again. I've seen many a
clever cracksman, but never one like him. If
you hang Jack Sheppard, you'll cut off the
flower o' the purfession. But I'll not believe
it of you. It's all very well to read him a
lesson, and teach him obedience; but you've
gone far enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; rejoined the thieftaker, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; growled Blueskin, &ldquo;you've had
my offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you my warning,&rdquo; retorted Wild.
&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Blueskin,&rdquo; whispered Jack, in his natural</pp>
<pb n="179">
<pp>tones, as the other passed him, &ldquo;wait without.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Powers o' mercy!&rdquo; cried Blueskin starting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; demanded Jonathan,
harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin'&mdash;nothin',&rdquo; returned Blueskin; 
&ldquo;only I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw the hangman, no doubt,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;Take courage, man; it is only Quilt
Arnold. Come, make yourself scarce. Don't
you see Mr. Wild's busy.&rdquo; And then he added,
in an under tone, &ldquo;Conceal yourself outside,
and be within call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blueskin nodded, and left the room. Jack
affected to close the door, but left it slightly ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say to him?&rdquo; inquired Jonathan,
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advised him not to trouble you farther
about Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; answered the supposed
janizary.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;He seems infatuated about the lad,&rdquo; observed
Wild. &ldquo;I shall be obliged to hang him
to keep him company. And now, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
he continued, turning to the knight, &ldquo;to our
own concerns. It's a long time since we met,
eight years and more. I hope you've enjoyed</pp>
<pb n="180">
<pp>your health. 'S life! you are wonderfully
altered. I should scarcely have known you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>The knight was indeed greatly changed.
Though not much passed the middle term of
life, he seemed prematurely stricken with old
age. His frame was wasted, and slightly bent; 
his eyes were hollow, his complexion haggard,
and his beard, which had remained unshorn
during his hasty journey, was perfectly white.
His manner, however, was as stern and haughty
as ever, and his glances retained their accustomed
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not come hither to consult you as to
the state of my health, sir,&rdquo; he observed, displeased
by Jonathan's allusion to the alteration
in his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Wild. &ldquo;You were no
doubt surprised by the unlooked&hyphen;for intelligence
I sent you of your nephew's return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it <it>unlooked&hyphen;for</it> on your part?&rdquo; demanded
the knight, distrustfully.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;On my soul, yes,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan. &ldquo;I
should as soon have expected the bones of
Tom Sheppard to reunite themselves and
walk out of that case, as Thames Darrell to
return. The skipper, Van Galgebrok, affirmed</pp>
<pb n="181">
<pp>to me,&mdash;nay, gave me the additional testimony
of two of his crew,&mdash;that he was thrown overboard.
But it appears he was picked up by
fishermen, and carried to France, where he has
remained ever since, and where it would have
been well for him if he had remained altogether.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo; asked Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Wild; &ldquo;and nothing but
the evidence of my senses would have made me
believe he was living, after the positive assurance
I received to the contrary. He is at
present with Mr. Wood,&mdash;the person whom
you may remember adopted him,&mdash;at Dollis
Hill, near Willesden; and it's a singular but
fortunate circumstance, so far as we are concerned,
that Mrs. Wood chanced to be murdered
by Blueskin, the fellow who just left the
room, on the very night of his return, as it has
thrown the house into such confusion, and so
distracted them, that he has had no time as
yet for hostile movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what course do you propose to pursue
in reference to him?&rdquo; asked Sir Rowland.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;My plan is a very simple one,&rdquo; rejoined</pp>
<pb n="182">
<pp>the thieftaker, smiling bitterly. &ldquo;I would
treat him as you treated his father, Sir Rowland.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder him!&rdquo; cried Trenchard, shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, murder him, if you like the term,&rdquo; 
returned Wild. &ldquo;I should call it putting him
out of the way. But, no matter how you
phrase it, the end is the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot consent to it,&rdquo; replied Sir Rowland
firmly. &ldquo;Since the sea has spared him,
I will spare him. It is in vain to struggle
against the arm of fate. I will shed no more
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perish upon the gibbet,&rdquo; rejoined
Jonathan, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flight is still left me,&rdquo; replied Trenchard.
&ldquo;I can escape to France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think I'll allow you to depart,&rdquo; 
cried Jonathan in a menacing tone, &ldquo;and compromise
<it>my</it> safety? No, no. We are linked
together in this matter, and must go through
with it. You cannot&mdash;shall not retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Death and hell!&rdquo; cried Sir Rowland,
rising and drawing his sword; &ldquo;do you</pp>
<pb n="183">
<pp>think you can shackle my free will, villain?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;In this particular instance I do, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
replied Jonathan, calmly, &ldquo;because
you are wholly in my power. But be patient,
I am your fast friend. Thames Darrell MUST
die. Our mutual safety requires it. Leave the
means to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More blood! more blood!&rdquo; cried Trenchard,
passing his hand with agony across his
brow. &ldquo;Shall I never banish those horrible
phantoms from my couch&mdash;the father with his
bleeding breast and dripping hair!&mdash;the mother
with her wringing hands and looks of vengeance
and reproach!&mdash;And must another be
added to their number&mdash;their son! Horror!&mdash; 
let me be spared this new crime! And yet the
gibbet&ndash;my name tarnished&mdash;my escutcheon
blotted by the hangman!&mdash;No, I cannot
submit to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; observed Jonathan,
who had some practice in the knight's moods,
and knew how to humour him. &ldquo;It's a miserable
weakness to be afraid of bloodshed.</p>
<p><pp>The general who gives an order for wholesale
carnage never sleeps a wink the less</pp>
<pb n="184">
<pp>soundly for the midnight groans of his victims,
and we should deride him as a coward if he
did. And life is much the same, whether taken
in battle, on the couch, or by the road&hyphen;side. Besides
those whom I've slain with my own hands,
I've brought upwards of thirty persons to the
gallows. Most of their relics are in yonder cases; 
but I don't remember that any of them have
disturbed my rest. The mode of destruction
makes no difference. It's precisely the same
thing to me to bid my janizaries cut Thames
Darrell's throat, as to order Jack Sheppard's
execution.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>As Jonathan said this, Jack's hand involuntarily
sought a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to the point,&rdquo; continued Wild, unconscious
of the peril in which the remark had
placed him,&mdash;&ldquo;to the point. On the terms
that procured your liberation from Newgate, I
will free you from this new danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those terms were a third of my estate,&rdquo; 
observed Trenchard bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that?&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan. &ldquo;Any
price was better than your head. If Thames
Darrell escapes, you will lose both life and
property.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="185">
<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; replied the knight, with an
agonized look; &ldquo;there is no alternative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; rejoined Wild. &ldquo;Is it
a bargain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take half of my estate&mdash;take all&mdash;my life,
if you will&mdash;I am weary of it!&rdquo; cried Trenchard
passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, &ldquo;I'll not take you
at your word, as regards the latter proposition.
We shall both, I hope, live to enjoy
our shares&mdash;long after Thames Darrell is forgotten
&mdash;ha! ha! A third of your estate I
accept. And as these things should always be
treated as matters of business, I'll just draw
up a memorandum of our arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as he spoke, he took up a sheet of
paper, and hastily traced a few lines upon
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sign this,&rdquo; he said, pushing the document
towards Sir Rowland.</p>
<p>The knight mechanically complied with his
request.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; cried Jonathan, eagerly pocketing
the memorandum. &ldquo;And now, in return
for your liberality, I'll inform you of a secret</pp>
<pb n="186">
<pp>with which it is important you should be
acquainted.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret!&rdquo; exclaimed Trenchard. &ldquo;Concerning
whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sheppard!&rdquo; echoed Jack, surprised
out of his caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Wild, looking angrily
towards his supposed attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; replied Jack, with the
accent and manner of the janizary; &ldquo;I was
betrayed into the exclamation by my surprise
that anything in which Sir Rowland Trenchard
was interested could have reference to so humble
a person as Mrs. Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be pleased, then, in future not to let your
surprise find vent in words,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan,
sternly. &ldquo;My servants, like Eastern
mutes, must have eyes, and ears,&mdash;and <it>hands</it>,
if need be,&mdash;but no tongues. You understand
me, sirrah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I'm dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your secret?&rdquo; demanded Trenchard, impatiently.</p>
<pb n="187">
<p>&ldquo;I need not remind you, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; replied
Wild, &ldquo;that you had two sisters&mdash;Aliva
and Constance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both are dead,&rdquo; observed the knight,
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so;&rdquo; answered Wild. &ldquo;Constance
is yet living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance alive! Impossible!&rdquo; ejaculated
Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've proofs to the contrary,&rdquo; replied Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is the case, where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Bedlam,&rdquo; replied the thieftaker, with a
Satanic grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight,
upon whom a light seemed suddenly to break.
&ldquo;You mentioned Mrs. Sheppard. What has
she to do with Constance Trenchard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sheppard <it>is</it> Constance Trenchard,&rdquo; 
replied Jonathan, maliciously.</p>
<p>Here Jack Sheppard was unable to repress
an exclamation of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; cried Jonathan, sternly: &ldquo;beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; vociferated Trenchard. &ldquo;My</pp>
<pb n="188">
<pp>sister the wife of one condemned felon! the
parent of another! It cannot be.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It <it>is</it> so, nevertheless,&rdquo; replied Wild.
&ldquo;Stolen by a gipsy when scarcely five years
old, Constance Trenchard, after various vicissitudes,
was carried to London, where she
lived in great poverty, with the dregs of society.
It is useless to trace out her miserable
career; though I can easily do so if you require
it. To preserve herself, however, from destitution,
or what she considered worse, she wedded
a journeyman carpenter, named Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! that one so highly born should submit
to such a degradation?&rdquo; groaned the
knight.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I see nothing surprising in it,&rdquo; rejoined
Jonathan. &ldquo;In the first place, she had no
knowledge of her birth; and, consequently, no
false pride to get rid of. In the second, she
was wretchedly poor, and assailed by temptations
of which you can form no idea. Distress
like hers might palliate far greater offences than
she ever committed. With the same inducements
we should all do the same thing. Poor</pp>
<pb n="189">
<pp>girl! she was beautiful once; so beautiful as to
make <it>me</it>, who care little for the allurements of
women, fancy myself enamoured of her.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Jack Sheppard again sought his pistol, and
was only withheld from levelling it at the thieftaker's
head, by the hope that he might gather
some further information respecting his mother.
And he had good reason before long to congratulate
himself on his forbearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What proof have you of the truth of this
story?&rdquo; inquired Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, taking a paper
from a portfolio, and handing it to the knight,
&ldquo;this written evidence, signed by Martha
Cooper, the gipsy, by whom the girl was
stolen, and who was afterwards executed for a
similar crime. It is attested, you will observe,
by the Reverend Mr. Purney, the present ordinary
of Newgate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am acquainted with Mr. Purney's handwriting,&rdquo; 
said Jack, advancing, &ldquo;and can at
once decide whether this is a forgery or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it, then,&rdquo; said Wild, giving him
the portfolio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's the ordinary's signature, undoubtedly,&rdquo; 
replied Jack.</p>
<pb n="190">
<p>And as he gave back the portfolio to Sir Rowland
he contrived, unobserved, to slip the precious
document into his sleeve, and from thence
into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, does any of our bright blood flow in
the veins of a ruffianly housebreaker?&rdquo; cried
Trenchard, with a look of bewilderment. &ldquo;I'll
not believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others may, if you won't,&rdquo; muttered
Jack, retiring. &ldquo;Thank heaven! I'm not
basely born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, mark me,&rdquo; said Jonathan, &ldquo;and
you'll find I don't do things by halves. By
your father, Sir Montacute Trenchard's will,
you are aware,&mdash;and, therefore, I need not repeat
it, except for the special purpose I have in
view,&mdash;you are aware, I say, that, by this will,
in case your sister Aliva, died without issue,
or, on the death of such issue, the property
reverts to Constance and <it>her</it> issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Sir Rowland, moodily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; muttered Jack.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Thames Darrell once destroyed,&rdquo; pursued
Jonathan, &ldquo;Constance&mdash;or, rather, Mrs.
Sheppard&mdash;becomes entitled to the estates;</pp>
<pb n="191">
<pp>which eventually&mdash;provided he escaped the
gallows&mdash;would descend to her son.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, drawing in his
breath, and leaning forward with intense curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; gasped Sir Rowland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this need give you no uneasiness,&rdquo; 
pursued Jonathan; &ldquo;Mrs. Sheppard, as I told
you, is in Bedlam, an incurable maniac; while
her son is in the New Prison, whence he will
only be removed to Newgate and Tyburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think,&rdquo; muttered Jack, between
his ground teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make your mind perfectly easy on the
score of Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; continued Jonathan; 
&ldquo;after we've disposed of Thames Darrell, I'll
visit her in Bedlam; and, as I understand I
form one of her chief terrors, I'll give her
such a fright that I'll engage she shan't long
survive it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil!&rdquo; muttered Jack, again grasping
his pistol. But, feeling secure of vengeance,
he determined to abide his time.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;And now, having got rid of the minor obstacles,&rdquo; 
said Jonathan, &ldquo;I'll submit a plan
for the removal of the main difficulty. Thames</pp>
<pb n="192">
<pp>Darrell, I've said, is at Mr. Wood's at Dollis&hyphen;hill,
wholly unsuspicious of any designs
against him, and, in fact, entirely ignorant of
your being acquainted with his return, or even
of his existence. In this state, it will be easy
to draw him into a snare. To&hyphen;morrow night&mdash; 
or rather to&hyphen;night, for we are fast verging on
another day&mdash;I propose to lure him out of the
house by a stratagem which I am sure will
prove infallible; and, then, what so easy as to
knock him on the head. To make sure work
of it, I'll superintend the job myself. Before
mid&hyphen;night, I'll answer for it, it shall be done.
My janizaries shall go with me. You hear
what I say, Quilt?&rdquo; he added, looking at
Jack.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abraham Mendez will like the task,&mdash;for
he has entertained a hatred to the memory of
Thames Darrell ever since he received the
wound in the head, when the two lads attempted
to break out of St. Giles's roundhouse.
I've despatched him to the New Prison. But
I expect him back every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The New Prison!&rdquo; exclaimed Sheppard.
&ldquo;What is he gone there for?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="193">
<p>&ldquo;With a message to the turnkey to look
after his prisoner,&rdquo; replied Wild, with a cunning
smile. &ldquo;Jack Sheppard had a visiter, I
understand, yesterday, and may make an attempt
to escape. It's as well to be on the
safe side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>At this moment, his quick ears detected the
sound of foot&hyphen;steps on the stairs. He drew
both his pistols, and prepared for a desperate
encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another mystery I would have
solved,&rdquo; said Trenchard, addressing Wild; 
&ldquo;you have told me much, but not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you require further?&rdquo; asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name and rank of Thames Darrell's
father,&rdquo; said the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another time,&rdquo; replied the thieftaker, evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have it now,&rdquo; rejoined Trenchard,
&ldquo;or our agreement is void.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot help yourself, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
replied Jonathan, contemptuously.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied the knight, drawing his</pp>
<pb n="194">
<pp>sword, &ldquo;the secret, villain, or I will force it
from you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Before Wild could make any reply, the door
was thrown violently open, and Abraham
Mendez rushed into the room, with a face of
the utmost consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hash eshcaped!&rdquo; cried the Jew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesh,&rdquo; replied Abraham. &ldquo;I vent to de
New Prish'n, and on wishitin' his shell vid de
turnkey, vot should ve find but de shains on
de ground, de vinder broken, and Jack and
Agevorth Besh gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; cried Jonathan, stamping his
foot with uncontrollable rage. &ldquo;I'd rather
have given a thousand pounds than this had
happened. But he might have broken out of
prison, and yet not got over the wall of
Clerkenwell Bridewell. Did you search the
yard, fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve did,&rdquo; replied Abraham; &ldquo;and found
his fine goat and ruffles torn to shtrips on de

<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>381Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010118">
<pb n="195">
<p>Jonathan gave utterance to a torrent of imprecations.</p>
<p>While he thus vented his rage, the door again
opened, and Quilt Arnold rushed into the
room, bleeding, and half&hyphen;dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Sblood! what's this?&rdquo; cried Jonathan,
in the utmost surprise. &ldquo;Quilt Arnold, is
that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, sir,&rdquo; sputtered the janizary. &ldquo;I've
been robbed, maltreated, and nearly murdered
by Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jack Sheppard!&rdquo; exclaimed the thieftaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I hope you'll take ample vengeance
upon him,&rdquo; said Quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, when I catch him, rely on it,&rdquo; rejoined
Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn't go far to do that,&rdquo; returned
Quilt; &lsquo;there he stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, here I am,&rdquo; said Jack, throwing off
his hat and wig, and marching towards the
group, amongst whom there was a general
movement of surprise at his audacity. &ldquo;Sir
Rowland, I salute you as your nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Back, villain!&rdquo; said the knight, haughtily.</pp>
<pb n="196">
<pp>&ldquo;I disown you. The whole story of your relationship
is a fabrication.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; replied Jack with equal
haughtiness. &ldquo;But, however, it may turn
out, I disown <it>you.</it>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jack,&rdquo; said Jonathan, who had
looked at him with surprise not unmixed with
admiration, &ldquo;you are a bold and clever fellow,
I must allow. Were I not Jonathan Wild, I'd
be Jack Sheppard. I'm almost sorry I've
sworn to hang you. But, it can't be helped.
I'm a slave to my word. Were I to let you
go, you'd say I feared you. Besides, you've
secrets which must not be disclosed. Nab and
Quilt to the door! Jack, you are my prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you flatter yourself you can detain
me?&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I'll try,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, sarcastically.
&ldquo;You must be a cleverer lad than
even <it>I</it> take you for, if you get out of this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ho! Blueskin!&rdquo; shouted Jack.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Here I am, captain,&rdquo; cried a voice from
without. And the door was suddenly thrown</pp>
<pb n="197">
<pp>open, and the two janizaries felled to the
ground by the strong arm of the stalwart robber.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boast, you see, was a little premature,
Mr. Wild,&rdquo; said Sheppard. &ldquo;Adieu,
my worthy uncle. Fortunately, I've secured
the proof of my birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confusion!&rdquo; thundered Wild. &ldquo;Close the
doors below! Loose the dogs! Curses! they
don't hear me! I'll ring the alarm&hyphen;bell.&rdquo; And
he raised his arm with the intention of executing
his purpose, when a ball from Jack's
pistol passed through the back of his hand,
shattering the limb. &ldquo;Aha! my lad!&rdquo; he
cried, without appearing to regard the pain of
the wound; &ldquo;now I'll show you no quarter.&rdquo; 
And, with the uninjured hand he drew a
pistol, which he fired, but without effect, at
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly, captain, fly!&rdquo; vociferated Blueskin; 
&ldquo;I shan't be able to keep these devils
down. Fly! They shall knock me on the
head&mdash;curse 'em!&mdash;before they shall touch
you.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="198">
<p>&ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; cried Jack, darting through
the door. &ldquo;The key's on the outside&mdash;quick!
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly alive to this chance, Blueskin
broke away. Two shots were fired at him by
Jonathan; one of which passed through his
hat, and the other through the fleshy part of
his arm; but he made good his retreat. The
door was closed&mdash;locked,&mdash;and the pair were
heard descending the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell's curses!&rdquo; roared Jonathan. &ldquo;They'll
escape. Not a moment is to be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he took hold of a ring in the floor,
and disclosed a flight of steps, down which he
hurried, followed by the janizaries. This means
of communication instantly brought them to
the lobby. But Jack and his companion were
already gone.</p>
<p><pp>Jonathan threw open the street&hyphen;door. Upon
the pavement near the court lay the porter,
who had been prostrated by a blow from
the butt&hyphen;end of a pistol. The man, who
was just able to move, pointed towards
Giltspur&hyphen;street. Jonathan looked in that</pp>
<pb n="199">
<pp>direction, and beheld the fugitives riding off
in triumph.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;To&hyphen;night it is <it>their</it> turn,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
binding up his wounded fingers with a handkerchief.
&ldquo;To&hyphen;morrow it will be <it>mine.</it>&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>The</smallcap> tragical affair at Dollis Hill, it need
scarcely be said, was a dreadful blow to the
family. Mr. Wood bore up with great fortitude
against the shock, attended the inquest,
delivered his evidence with composure, and
gave directions afterwards for the funeral,
which took place on the day but one following
&mdash;Sunday. As soon, however, as the last solemn
rites were over, and the remains of the
unfortunate woman committed to their final
resting&hyphen;place in Willesden churchyard, his firmness
completely deserted him, and he sank beneath
the weight of his affliction. It was fortunate
that by this time Winifred had so far
recovered, as to be able to afford her father the
best and only solace that, under the circumstances,
he could have received,&mdash;her personal
attentions.</p>
<pb n="201">
<p>The necessity which had previously existed
of leaving the ghastly evidence of the murderous
deed undisturbed,&mdash;the presence of the
mangled corpse,&mdash;the bustle of the inquest, at
which her attendance was required,&mdash;all these
circumstances produced a harrowing effect
upon the young girl's imagination. But when
all was over, a sorrowful calm succeeded, and,
if not free from grief, she was tranquil. As to
Thames, though deeply and painfully affected
by the horrible occurrence that had marked his
return to his old friends, he was yet able to
control his feelings, and devote himself to the
alleviation of the distress of the more immediate
sufferers by the calamity.</p>
<p><pp>It was Sunday evening&mdash;a soft delicious
evening, and, from the happy, <it>cheerful</it> look of
the house, none would have dreamed of the
dismal tragedy so lately acted within its walls.
The birds were singing blithely amid the trees,
&mdash;the lowing of the cows resounded from the
yard,&mdash;a delicious perfume from the garden
was wafted through the open window,&mdash;at a
distance, the church&hyphen;bells of Willesden were
heard tolling for evening service. All these</pp>
<pb n="202">
<pp>things spoke of peace;&mdash;but there are seasons
when the pleasantest external influences have a
depressing effect on the mind, by painfully recalling
past happiness. So, at least, thought
one of two persons who were seated together
in a small back&hyphen;parlour of the house at Dollis
Hill. She was a lovely girl, attired in deep
mourning, and having an expression of profound
sorrow on her charming features. Her
companion was a portly handsome man, also
dressed in a full suit of the deepest mourning,
with the finest of lace at his bosom and wrists,
and a sword in a black sheath by his side.
These persons were Mr. Kneebone and Winifred.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The funeral, it has just been said, took place
on that day. Amongst others who attended
the sad ceremony was Mr. Kneebone. Conceiving
himself called upon, as the intimate
friend of the deceased, to pay this last tribute
of respect to her memory, he appeared as one
of the chief mourners. Overcome by his affliction,
Mr. Wood had retired to his own room,
where he had just summoned Thames. Much
to her annoyance, therefore, Winifred was left</pp>
<pb n="203">
<pp>alone with the woollen&hyphen;draper, who following
up a maxim of his own, &ldquo;that nothing was
gained by too much bashfulness,&rdquo; determined
to profit by the opportunity. He had only
been prevented, indeed, by a fear of Mrs. Wood
from pressing his suit long ago. This obstacle
removed, he thought he might now make the
attempt. Happen what might, he could not
be in a worse position.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had a sad loss, my dear Winifred,&rdquo; 
he began,&mdash;&ldquo;for I must use the privilege
of an old friend, and address you by that
familiar name,&mdash;we have had a sad loss in the
death of your lamented parent, whose memory
I shall for ever revere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winifred's eyes filled with tears. This was
not exactly what the woollen&hyphen;draper desired.
So he resolved to try another tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very remarkable thing it is,&rdquo; he
observed, applying to his snuff&hyphen;box, &ldquo;that
Thames Darrell, whom we all supposed dead,&rdquo; 
&mdash;Kneebone in his heart sincerely wished he
<it>had</it> been so,&mdash;&ldquo;should turn out to be alive
after all. Strange, I shouldn't know him when
he called on me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="204">
<p>&ldquo;It <it>is</it> strange,&rdquo; replied Winifred, artlessly.
&ldquo;<it>I</it> knew him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone, a little
maliciously, &ldquo;but that's easily accounted for.
May I be permitted, as a very old and very
dear friend of your lamented parent, whose
loss I shall ever deplore, to ask you one question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will answer it frankly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for it,&rdquo; thought the woollen&hyphen;draper.
&ldquo;I shall, at least, ascertain how the land lies.
&mdash;Well, then, my dear,&rdquo; he added aloud, &ldquo;do
you still entertain the strong attachment you
did to Captain Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winifred's cheeks glowed with blushes, and
fixing her eyes, which flashed with resentment,
upon the questioner, she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have promised to answer your question,
and I will do so. I love him as a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>Only</it> as a brother?&rdquo; persisted Kneebone.</p>
<p>If Winifred remained silent, her looks would
have disarmed a person of less assurance than
the woollen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<pb n="205">
<p>&ldquo;If you knew how much importance I attach
to your answer,&rdquo; he continued, passionately,
&ldquo;you would not refuse me one. Were Captain
Darrell to offer you his hand, would you accept
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your impertinence deserves very different
treatment, sir,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;but, to put
an end to this annoyance, I will tell you&mdash;I
would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; asked Kneebone, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not submit to be thus interrogated,&rdquo; 
said Winifred, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of your lamented parent,
whose memory I shall for ever revere, I implore
you to answer me,&rdquo; urged Kneebone, &ldquo;why
&mdash;why would you not accept him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because our positions are different,&rdquo; replied
Winifred, who could not resist this appeal
to her feelings.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You are a paragon of prudence and discretion,&rdquo; 
rejoined the woollen&hyphen;draper, drawing his
chair closer to hers. &ldquo;Disparity of rank is
ever productive of unhappiness in the married
state. When Captain Darrell's birth is ascertained,
I've no doubt he'll turn out a nobleman's</pp>
<pb n="206">
<pp>son. At least, I hope so for his sake as
well as my own,&rdquo; he added, mentally. &ldquo;He
has quite the air of one. And now, my angel,
that I am acquainted with your sentiments on
this subject, I shall readily fulfil a promise
which I made to your lamented parent, whose
loss I shall ever deplore.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;A promise to my mother?&rdquo; said Winifred,
unsuspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my angel, to <it>her</it>&mdash;rest her soul! She
extorted it from me, and bound me by a so
lemn oath to fulfil it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! name it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a party concerned. Promise me
that you will not disobey the injunctions of her
whose memory we must both of us ever revere.
Promise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If in my power&mdash;certainly. But, what is
it? What <it>did</it> you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To offer you my heart, my hand, my life,&rdquo; 
replied Kneebone, falling at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Winifred, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inequality of rank can be no bar to <it>our</it>
union,&rdquo; continued Kneebone. &ldquo;Heaven be
praised, <it>I</it> am not the son of a nobleman.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="207">
<p>In spite of her displeasure, Winifred could
not help smiling at the absurdity of this address.
Taking this for encouragement, her
suitor proceeded still more extravagantly.
Seizing her hand, he covered it with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adorable girl!&rdquo; he cried, in the most impassioned
tone, and with the most impassioned
look he could command. &ldquo;Adorable girl, I
have long loved you to desperation. Your
lamented mother, whose loss I shall ever deplore,
perceived my passion, and encouraged it.
Would she were alive to back my suit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is beyond all endurance,&rdquo; said Winifred,
striving to withdraw her hand. &ldquo;Leave
me, sir; I insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone, with increased
ardour,&mdash;&ldquo;never, till I receive from your
own lips the answer which is to make me the
happiest or the most miserable of mankind.
Hear me, adorable girl! You know not the
extent of my devotion. No mercenary consideration
influences me. Love&mdash;admiration for
your matchless beauty alone sways me. Let
your father&mdash;if he chooses, leave all his wealth
to his adopted son. I care not. Possessed of</pp>
<pb n="208">
<pp><it>you</it>, I shall have a treasure such as kings could
not boast.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray cease this nonsense,&rdquo; said Winifred,
&ldquo;and quit the room, or I will call for assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, the door opened, and
Thames entered the room. As the woollen&hyphen;draper's
back was towards him, he did not perceive
him, but continued his passionate addresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call as you please, beloved girl,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;I will not stir till I am answered. You say
that you only love Captain Darrell as a brother
&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kneebone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you would not accept him were he
to offer&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then,&rdquo; continued the woollen&hyphen;draper,
&ldquo;is no longer considered&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; cried Thames, advancing,
&ldquo;what is the meaning of your reference to my
name? Have you dared to insult this lady?
If so&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Insult her!&rdquo; replied Kneebone, rising,</pp>
<pb n="209">
<pp>and endeavouring to hide his embarrassment
under a look of defiance. &ldquo;Far from it, sir. I
have made her an honourable proposal of marriage,
in compliance with the request of her
lamented parent, whose memory&wblank;&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare to utter that falsehood in my hearing
again, scoundrel,&rdquo; interrupted Thames fiercely,
&ldquo;and I will put it out of your power to repeat
the offence. Leave the room! leave the house,
sir! and enter it again at your peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do neither, sir,&rdquo; replied Kneebone,
&ldquo;unless I am requested by this lady to withdraw,
&mdash;in which case I shall comply with her
request. And you have to thank her presence,
hot&hyphen;headed boy, that I do not chastise your
insolence as it deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Mr. Kneebone,&mdash;pray go!&rdquo; implored
Winifred. &ldquo;Thames, I entreat&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wishes are my laws, beloved girl,&rdquo; 
replied Kneebone, bowing profoundly. &ldquo;Captain
Darrell,&rdquo; he added, sternly, &ldquo;you shall
hear from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;When you please, sir,&rdquo; said Thames,
coldly.</pp>
<pb n="210">
<pp>And the woollen&hyphen;draper departed.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all this, dear Winny?&rdquo; inquired
Thames, as soon as they were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; she answered, bursting
into tears. &ldquo;Don't ask me about it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winny,&rdquo; said Thames, tenderly, &ldquo;something
which that self&hyphen;sufficient fool has said
has so far done me a service in enabling me to
speak upon a subject which I have long had
upon my lips, but have not had courage to
utter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to doubt my love,&rdquo; he continued,
&mdash;&ldquo;you seem to think that change of
circumstances may produce some change in my
affections. Hear me then, now, before I take
one step to establish my origin, or secure my
rights. Whatever those rights may be, whoever
I am, my heart is yours. Do you accept
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Thames!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive this ill&hyphen;timed avowal of my love.
But, answer me. Am I mistaken? Is your
heart mine?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="211">
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;it is; and has ever been,&rdquo; replied
Winifred, falling upon his neck.</p>
<p>Lovers' confidences should be respected.
We close the chapter.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>On</smallcap> the following night&mdash;namely Monday,&mdash; 
the family assembled together, for the first
time since the fatal event, in the chamber to
which Thames had been introduced on his arrival
at Dollis Hill. As this had been Mrs.
Wood's favourite sitting&hyphen;room, and her image
was so intimately associated with it, neither the
carpenter nor his daughter could muster courage
to enter it before. Determined, however, to
conquer the feeling as soon as possible, Wood
had given orders to have the evening meal served
there; but, notwithstanding all his good resolutions
upon his first entrance, he had much
ado to maintain his self&hyphen;command. His wife's
portrait had been removed from the walls, and
the place it had occupied was only to be known
by the cord by which it had been suspended.</pp>
<pb n="213">
<pp>The very blank, however, affected him more
deeply than if it had been left. Then a handkerchief
was thrown over the cage, to prevent
the bird from singing; it was <it>her</it> favourite canary.
The flowers upon the mantel&hyphen;shelf were
withered and drooping&mdash;<it>she</it> had gathered them.
All these circumstances,&mdash;slight in themselves,
but powerful in their effect,&mdash;touched the heart
of the widowed carpenter, and added to his depression.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Supper was over. It had been discussed in
silence. The cloth was removed, and Wood,
drawing the table as near the window as possible
&mdash;for it was getting dusk&mdash;put on his spectacles,
and opened that sacred volume from
which the best consolation in affliction is derived,
and left the lovers&mdash;for such they may
now be fairly termed&mdash;to their own conversation.
Having already expressed our determination
not to betray any confidences of this
sort, which, however interesting to the parties
concerned, could not possibly be so to others,
we shall omit also the &ldquo;love passages,&rdquo; and
proceeding to such topics as may have general
interest, take up the discourse at the point</pp>
<pb n="214">
<pp>when Thames Darrell expressed his determination
of starting for Manchester, as soon as Jack
Sheppard's examination had taken place.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised we have received no summons
for attendance to&hyphen;day,&rdquo; he remarked; 
&ldquo;perhaps the other robber may be secured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Jack have escaped,&rdquo; remarked Winny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think that's likely. But, this sad
affair disposed of, I will not rest till I have
avenged my murdered parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<it>The avenger of blood himself shall slay
the murderer</it>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Wood, who was culling
for himself certain texts from the scriptures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the voice of inspiration,&rdquo; said
Thames; &ldquo;and I receive it as a solemn command.
The villain has enjoyed his security
too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<it>Bloody and deceitful men shall not live
half their days</it>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Wood, reading aloud
another passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, <it>he</it> has been spared thus long; 
perhaps with a wise purpose,&rdquo; rejoined
Thames. &ldquo;But, though the storm has
spared him, <it>I</it> will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;&lsquo;<it>No doubt</it>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Wood, who had again</pp>
<pb n="215">
<pp>turned over the leaves of the sacred volume,&mdash; 
&ldquo;&lsquo;<it>no doubt this man is a murderer, whom,
though he escaped the seas, yet vengeance suffereth
not to live</it>,&rsquo;&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;No feelings of consanguinity shall stay my
vengeance,&rdquo; said Thames, sternly. &ldquo;I will
have no satisfaction but his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<it>Thou shalt take no satisfaction for the
life of a murderer which is guilty of death,
but he shall surely be put to death</it>,&rdquo; said Wood,
referring to another text.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not steel your heart against him, dear
Thames,&rdquo; interposed Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<it>And thine eye shall not pity</it>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said her
father, in a tone of rebuke, &ldquo;&lsquo;<it>but, life shall
be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand
for hand, foot for foot.</it>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As these words were delivered by the carpenter
with stern emphasis, a female servant
entered the room, and stated that a gentleman
was at the door, who wished to speak with
Captain Darrell on business of urgent importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me?&rdquo; said Thames. &ldquo;Who is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="216">
<p>&ldquo;He didn't give his name, sir,&rdquo; replied the
maid; &ldquo;but he's a young gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't go near him, dear Thames,&rdquo; said
Winifred; &ldquo;he may have some ill intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; cried Thames. &ldquo;What! refuse
to see a person who desires to speak with me.
Say I will come to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law! miss,&rdquo; observed the maid, &ldquo;there's
nothing mischievous in the person's appearance,
I'm sure. He 's as nice and civil&hyphen;spoken
a gentleman as need be; by the same
token,&rdquo; she added, in an under tone, &ldquo;that
he gave me a span new crown piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<it>The thief cometh in the night, and the
troop of robbers spoileth without</it>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Wood,
who had a text for every emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor' ha' mussy, sir!&mdash;how you <it>do</it> talk,&rdquo; 
said the woman; &ldquo;this is no robber, I 'm
sure. I should have known at a glance if it
was. He 's more like a lord than&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, steps were heard approaching; 
the door was thrown open, and a young man
marched boldly into the room.</p>
<p><pp>The intruder was handsomely, even richly,</pp>
<pb n="217">
<pp>attired in a scarlet riding&hyphen;suit, embroidered
with gold; a broad belt, to which a hanger
was attached, crossed his shoulders; his boots
rose above his knee, and he carried a laced hat
in his hand. Advancing to the middle of the
chamber, he halted, drew himself up, and fixed
his dark, expressive eyes, on Thames Darrell.
His appearance excited the greatest astonishment
and consternation amid the group. Winifred
screamed. Thames sprang to his feet,
and half drew his sword, while Wood, removing
his spectacles to assure himself that his
eyes did not deceive him, exclaimed in a tone
and with a look that betrayed the extremity
of surprise&mdash;&ldquo;Jack Sheppard!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Sheppard!&rdquo; echoed the maid. &ldquo;Is
this Jack Sheppard? Oh, la! I'm undone!
We shall all have our throats cut! Oh! oh!&rdquo; 
And she rushed, screaming, into the passage
where she fell down in a fit.</p>
<p><pp>The occasion of all this confusion and dismay,
meanwhile, remained perfectly motionless; 
his figure erect, and with somewhat of
dignity in his demeanour. He kept his keen</pp>
<pb n="218">
<pp>eyes steadily fixed on Thames, as if awaiting
to be addressed.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your audacity passes belief,&rdquo; cried the
latter, as soon as his surprise would allow him
utterance. &ldquo;If you have contrived to break
out of your confinement, villain, this is the last
place where you ought to show yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, therefore, the first I would visit,&rdquo; 
replied Jack, boldly. &ldquo;But, pardon my intrusion.
I was <it>resolved</it> to see you. And, fearing
you might not come to me, I forced my
way hither, even with certainty of discomposing
your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, villain!&rdquo; replied Thames, &ldquo;I know
not the motive of your visit. But, if you have
come to surrender yourself to justice, it is well.
You cannot depart hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Cannot?&rdquo; echoed Jack, a slight smile
crossing his features. &ldquo;But, let that pass.
My motive in coming hither is to serve you,
and save your life. If you choose to requite
me by detaining me, you are at liberty to do
so. I shall make no defence. That I am not
ignorant of the reward offered for my capture
this will show,&rdquo; he added, taking a large placard</pp>
<pb n="219">
<pp>headed &lsquo;<it>Murder</it>&rsquo; from his pocket, and
throwing it on the floor. &ldquo;My demeanour ought
to convince you that I came with no hostile intention.
And, to show you that I have no intention
of flying, I will myself close and lock the
door. There is the key. Are you now satisfied?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; interposed Wood, furiously, &ldquo;I
shall never be satisfied till I see you hanged on
the highest gibbet at Tyburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A time may come when you will be gratified,
Mr. Wood,&rdquo; replied Jack, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May come!&mdash;it <it>will</it> come!&mdash;it <it>shall</it>
come!&rdquo; cried the carpenter, shaking his hand
menacingly at him. &ldquo;I have some difficulty
in preventing myself from becoming your
executioner. Oh! that I should have nursed
such a viper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, sir,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won't hear you, murderer,&rdquo; rejoined
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no murderer,&rdquo; replied Sheppard. &ldquo;I
had no thought of injuring your wife, and would
have died rather than commit so foul a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Think not to delude me, audacious
wretch,&rdquo; cried the carpenter. &ldquo;Even if you</pp>
<pb n="220">
<pp>are not a principal, you are an accessary. If
you had not brought your companion here, it
would not have happened. But you shall
swing, rascal,&mdash;you shall swing.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;My conscience acquits me of all share in
the offence,&rdquo; replied Jack, humbly. &ldquo;But
the past is irremediable, and I did not come
hither to exculpate myself. I came to save
<it>your</it> life,&rdquo; he added, turning to Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not aware it was in danger,&rdquo; rejoined
Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to be thankful to me for
the warning. You <it>are</it> in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From some of your associates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your uncle, from <it>my</it> uncle,&mdash;Sir
Rowland Trenchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What means this idle boasting, villain?&rdquo; 
said Thames. &ldquo;<it>Your</it> uncle, Sir Rowland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no idle boasting,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;You are cousin to the housebreaker, Jack
Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were so, he would have great reason
to be proud of the relationship, truly,&rdquo; observed
Wood, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to make an assertion like this,&rdquo; 
said Thames, contemptuously.</p>
<pb n="221">
<p>&ldquo;And equally easy to prove it,&rdquo; replied
Jack, giving him the paper he had abstracted
from Wild. &ldquo;Read that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thames hastily cast his eyes over it, and
transferred it, with a look of incredulity, to
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious heavens! this is more wonderful
than all the rest,&rdquo; cried the carpenter, rubbing
his eyes. &ldquo;Thames, this is no forgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe it, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the bottom of my heart. I always
thought Mrs. Sheppard superior to her station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;Let me look
at the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul!&mdash;poor soul!&rdquo; groaned Wood,
brushing the tears from his vision. &ldquo;Well,
I'm glad she's spared this. Oh! Jack, Jack,
you've much to answer for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, indeed,&rdquo; replied Sheppard, in a
tone of contrition.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;If this document is correct,&rdquo; continued
Wood, &ldquo;and I am persuaded it is so,&mdash;you
are as unfortunate as wicked. See what your
misconduct has deprived you of&mdash;see what</pp>
<pb n="222">
<pp>you might have been. This is retribution.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel it,&rdquo; replied Jack, in a tone of agony,
&ldquo;and I feel it more on my poor mother's account
than my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has suffered enough for you,&rdquo; said
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has, she has,&rdquo; said Jack, in a broken
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weep on, reprobate,&rdquo; cried the carpenter,
a little softened. &ldquo;Those tears will do you
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not distress him, dear father,&rdquo; said
Winifred; &ldquo;he suffers deeply. Oh, Jack!
repent, while it is yet time, of your evil conduct.
I will pray for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot repent.&mdash;I cannot pray,&rdquo; replied
Jack, recovering his hardened demeanour.
&ldquo;I should never have been what I am, but
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; inquired Winifred.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I loved you,&rdquo; replied Jack,&mdash;&ldquo;don't start
&mdash;it is over now&mdash;I loved you, I say, as a boy,
<it>hopelessly</it>, and it made me desperate. And now
I find, when it is too late, that I <it>might</it> have</pp>
<pb n="223">
<pp>deserved you&mdash;that I am as well born as
Thames Darrell. But I mustn't think of these
things, or I shall grow mad. I have said
your life is in danger, Thames. Do not slight
my warning. Sir Rowland Trenchard is aware of
your return to England. I saw him last night at
Jonathan Wild's, after my escape from the New
Prison. He had just arrived from Manchester,
whence he had been summoned by that
treacherous thief taker. I overheard them
planning your assassination. It is to take place
to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh heavens!&rdquo; screamed Winifred, while
her father lifted up his hands in silent horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I further tell you,&rdquo; continued
Jack, &ldquo;that, after yourself and my mother, <it>I</it>
am the next heir to the estates of my grandfather,
Sir Montacute Trenchard, you will perhaps
own that my caution is sufficiently disinterested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I credit your wild story, I might do
so,&rdquo; returned Thames, with a look of perplexity.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Here are Jonathan Wild's written instructions
to Quilt Arnold,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard, producing
the pocket&hyphen;book he had found in the</pp>
<pb n="224">
<pp>janizary's clothes. &ldquo;This letter will vouch for
me that a communication has taken place between
your enemies.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Thames glanced at the despatch, and, after
a moment's reflection, inquired, &ldquo;In what
way is the attempt upon my life to be made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I couldn't ascertain,&rdquo; replied Jack; 
&ldquo;but I advise you to be upon your guard.
For aught I know, they may be in the neighbourhood
at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; ejaculated Wood, with a look of
alarm. &ldquo;Oh lord! I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I do know,&rdquo; continued Jack,&mdash;&ldquo;Jonathan
Wild superintends the attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan Wild!&rdquo; repeated the carpenter,
trembling. &ldquo;Then it's all over with us. Oh
dear!&mdash;how sorry I am I ever left Wych&hyphen;street.
We may be all murdered in this unprotected
place, and nobody be the wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's some one in the garden at this
moment,&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;I saw a face at the
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where?&rdquo; cried Thames.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Don't stir,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I will at
once convince you of the truth of my assertions,</pp>
<pb n="225">
<pp>and ascertain whether the enemy really is at
hand.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>So saying, he advanced towards the window,
threw open the sash, and called out in the voice
of Thames Darrell,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was answered by a shot from a pistol.
The ball passed over his head, and lodged in
the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; replied Jack, returning as
coolly as if nothing had happened. &ldquo;It is Jonathan.
Your uncle&mdash;<it>our</it> uncle is with him.
I saw them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I trust you?&rdquo; cried Thames, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;I'll fight for
you to the last gasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, then,&rdquo; cried Thames, drawing
his sword, and springing through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the world's end,&rdquo; answered Jack, darting
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames!&mdash;Thames!&rdquo; cried Winifred,
rushing to the window. &ldquo;He will be murdered!
&mdash;Help!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="226">
<p>&ldquo;My child!&mdash;my love!&rdquo; cried Wood,
dragging her forcibly back.</p>
<p>Two shots were fired, and presently the
clashing of swords was heard below.</p>
<p>After some time, the scuffle grew more and
more distant, until nothing could be heard.</p>
<p>Wood, meanwhile, had summoned his men&hyphen;servants,
and having armed them with such
weapons as could be found, they proceeded to
the garden, where the first object they encountered
was Thames Darrell, extended on
the ground, and weltering in his blood. Of
Jack Sheppard or the assailants they could not
discover a single trace.</p>
<p>As the body was borne to the house in the
arms of the farming&hyphen;men, Mr. Wood fancied
he heard the exulting laugh of Jonathan Wild.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>When</smallcap> Thames Darrell and Jack Sheppard
sprang through the window, they were instantly
assailed by Wild, Trenchard, and their attendants.
Jack attacked Jonathan with such
fury, that he drove him into a shrubbery, and
might perhaps have come off the victor, if his
foot had not slipped as he made a desperate
lunge. In this state it would have been all
over with him, as, being stunned by the fall,
it was some moments before he could recover
himself, if another party had not unexpectedly
come to his rescue. This was Blueskin, who
burst through the trees, and sword in hand assaulted
the thieftaker. As soon as Jack gained
his legs, he perceived Blueskin lying, as he
thought, dead in the plantation, with a severe
cut across his temples, and while he was stooping
to assist him, he heard groans at a little</pp>
<pb n="228">
<pp>distance. Hastening in the direction of the
sound, he discovered Thames Darrell, stretched
upon the ground.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Thames?&rdquo; asked Jack,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dangerously, I hope,&rdquo; returned
Thames; &ldquo;but fly&mdash;save yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the assassins?&rdquo; cried Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; replied the wounded man. &ldquo;They
imagine their work is done. But I may yet
live to thwart them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will carry you to the house, or fetch Mr.
Wood,&rdquo; urged Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; rejoined Thames; &ldquo;fly&mdash;or I
will not answer for your safety. If you desire
to please me, you will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you thus?&rdquo; rejoined Jack. &ldquo;I
cannot do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, I insist,&rdquo; cried Thames, &ldquo;or take the
consequences upon yourself. I cannot protect
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Thus urged, Jack reluctantly departed.
Hastening to the spot where he had tied his
horse to a tree, he vaulted into the saddle, and</pp>
<pb n="229">
<pp>rode off across the fields,&mdash;for he was fearful of
encountering the hostile party,&mdash;till he reached
the Edgeware Road. Arrived at Paddington,
he struck across Marylebone Fields,&mdash;for as yet
the New Road was undreamed of,&mdash;and never
moderated his speed until he reached the city.
His destination was the New Mint. At this
place of refuge, situated in the heart of Wapping,
near the river&hyphen;side, he arrived in less than
an hour, in a complete state of exhaustion.</pp></p>
<p><pp>In consequence of the infamous abuse of its
liberties, an act for the entire suppression of
the Old Mint was passed in the ninth year of
the reign of George the First, not many months
before the date of the present epoch of this history; 
and as, after the destruction of Whitefriars,
which took place in the reign of Charles
the Second, owing to the protection afforded
by its inmates to the Levellers and Fifth&hyphen;monarchy&hyphen;men,
when the inhabitants of Alsatia
crossed the water, and settled themselves in the
borough of Southwark,&mdash;so now, driven out of
their fastnesses, they again migrated, and recrossing
the Thames, settled in Wapping, in a
miserable quarter between Artichoke Lane and</pp>
<pb n="230">
<pp>Nightingale Lane, which they termed the New
Mint. Ousted from his old retreat, the Cross
Shovels, Baptist Kettleby opened another tavern,
conducted upon the same plan as the
former, which he denominated the Seven Cities
of Refuge. His subjects, however, were no
longer entirely under his control; and, though
he managed to enforce some little attention to
his commands, it was evident his authority
was waning fast. Aware that they would not
be allowed to remain long unmolested, the
New Minters conducted themselves so outrageously,
and with such extraordinary insolence,
that measures were at this time being taken for
their effectual suppression.</pp></p>
<p>To the Seven Cities of Refuge Jack proceeded.
Having disposed of his steed and
swallowed a glass of brandy, without taking any
other refreshment, he threw himself on a couch,
where he sank at once into a heavy slumber.
When he awoke it was late in the day, and he
was surprised to find Blueskin seated by his
bed&hyphen;side, watching over him with a drawn
sword on his knee, a pistol in each hand, and
a blood&hyphen;stained cloth bound across his brow.</p>
<pb n="231">
<p>&ldquo;Don't disturb yourself,&rdquo; said his follower,
motioning him to keep still; &ldquo;it's all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Past noon,&rdquo; replied Blueskin. &ldquo;I didn't
awake you, because you seemed tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you escape?&rdquo; asked Sheppard,
who, as he shook off his slumber, began to recall
the events of the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, easily enough,&rdquo; rejoined the other.
&ldquo;I suppose I must have been senseless for
some time; for, on coming to myself, I found
this gash in my head, and the ground covered
with blood. However, no one had discovered
me, so I contrived to drag myself to my horse.
I thought if you were living, and not captured,
I should find you here,&mdash;and I was right. I
kept watch over you, for fear of a surprise on
the part of Jonathan. But what's to be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing I do,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;will
be to visit my poor mother in Bedlam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'd better take care of your mother's
son instead,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin. &ldquo;It's runnin'
a great risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Risk, or no risk, I shall go,&rdquo; replied Jack.</pp>
<pb n="232">
<pp>&ldquo;Jonathan has threatened to do her some mischief.
I am resolved to see her, without delay,
and ascertain if it's possible to remove her.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a hopeless job,&rdquo; grumbled Blueskin,
&ldquo;and harm will come of it. What are you to
do with a mad mother at a time when you
need all your wits to take care of yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't concern yourself further about me,&rdquo; 
returned Jack. &ldquo;Once for all, I shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't you take me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you must await my return here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must wait a long time,&rdquo; grumbled
Blueskin. &ldquo;You'll never return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;But, if I
should <it>not</it> return, take this purse to Edgeworth
Bess. You'll find her at Black Mary's Hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, having partaken of a hasty breakfast,
he set out. Taking his way along East Smithfield,
mounting Little Tower&hyphen;hill, and threading
the Minories and Hounsditch, he arrived without
accident or molestation, at Moorfields.</p>
<p><pp>Old Bethlehem, or Bedlam,&mdash;every trace of
which has been swept away, and the hospital
for lunatics removed to Saint George's Field,&mdash; 
was a vast and magnificent structure. Erected</pp>
<pb n="233">
<pp>in Moorfields in 1675, upon the model of the
Tuileries, it is said that Louis the Fourteenth
was so incensed at the insult offered to his
palace, that he had a counterpart of St. James's
built for offices of the meanest description.
The size and grandeur of the edifice, indeed,
drew down the ridicule of several of the wits of
the age: by one of whom&mdash;the facetious Tom
Brown&mdash;it was said, &ldquo;Bedlam is a pleasant
place, and abounds with amusements;&mdash;the
first of which is the building, so stately a fabric
for persons wholly insensible of the beauty and
use of it: the outside being a perfect mockery
of the inside, and admitting of two amusing
queries,&mdash;Whether the persons that ordered the
building of it, or those that inhabit it, were the
maddest? and, whether the name and thing be
not as disagreeable as harp and harrow.&rdquo; By
another&mdash;the no less facetious Ned Ward&mdash;it
was termed, &ldquo;A costly college for a crackbrained
society, raised in a mad age, when the
chief of the city were in a great danger of losing
their senses, and so contrived it the more noble
for their own reception; or they would never
have flung away so much money to so foolish a</pp>
<pb n="234">
<pp>purpose.&rdquo; The cost of the building exceeded
seventeen thousand pounds. However the
taste of the architecture may be questioned,
which was the formal French style of the
period, the general effect was imposing. Including
the wings, it presented a frontage of
five hundred and forty feet. Each wing had a
small cupola; and, in the centre of the pile
rose a larger dome, surmounted by a gilded ball
and vane. The asylum was approached by a
broad gravel walk, leading through a garden
edged on either side by a stone balustrade, and
shaded by tufted trees. A wide terrace then
led to large iron gates, over which were placed
the two celebrated figures of Raving and Melancholy
Madness, executed by the elder Cibber,
and commemorated by Pope in the Dunciad, in
the well&hyphen;known lines:&mdash; 
<lb><lg><l>&ldquo;Close to those walls where Folly holds her throne,</l>
<l>And laughs to think Monroe would take her down,</l>
<l>Where, o'er the gates, by his famed father's hand,</l>
<l><it>Great Cibber's brazen, brainless brothers stand.</it>&rdquo;</l></lg></pp></p>
<lb><p><pp>Internally, it was divided by two long galleries,
one over the other. These galleries
were separated in the middle by iron grates.</pp>
<pb n="235">
<pp>The wards on the right were occupied by male
patients, on the left by the females. In the centre
of the upper gallery was a spacious saloon,
appropriated to the governors of the asylum.
But, the besetting evil of the place, and that
which drew down the severest censures of the
writers above&hyphen;mentioned, was that this spot,
&mdash;which of all others should have been most
free from such intrusion&mdash;was made a public
exhibition. There all the loose characters
thronged, assignations were openly made, and
the spectators diverted themselves with the
vagaries of its miserable inhabitants.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Entering the outer gate, and traversing the
broad gravel walk before&hyphen;mentioned, Jack
ascended the steps, and was admitted, on
feeing the porter, by another iron gate, into
the hospital. Here he was almost stunned by
the deafening clamour resounding on all sides.
Some of the lunatics were rattling their
chains; some shrieking; some singing; some
beating with frantic violence against the doors.
Altogether, it was the most dreadful noise he
had ever heard. Amidst it all, however, there</pp>
<pb n="236">
<pp>were several light&hyphen;hearted and laughing groups
walking from cell to cell, to whom all this
misery appeared matter of amusement. The
doors of several of the wards were thrown
open for these parties, and as Jack passed, he
could not help glancing at the wretched inmates.
Here was a poor half&hyphen;naked creature,
with a straw crown on his head, and a wooden
sceptre in his hand, seated on the ground with
all the dignity of a monarch on his throne.
There was a mad musician, seemingly rapt in
admiration of the notes he was extracting from
a child's violin. Here was a terrific figure
gnashing his teeth, and howling like a wild
beast;&mdash;there a lover, with hands clasped together,
and eyes turned passionately upward.
In this cell was a huntsman, who had fractured
his skull while hunting, and was perpetually
hallooing after the hounds;&mdash;in that,
the most melancholy of all, the grinning
gibbering lunatic, the realization of &ldquo;moody
madness, laughing wild.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>Hastening from this heart&hyphen;rending spectacle,
Jack soon reached the grating that divided the</pp>
<pb n="237">
<pp>men's compartment from that appropriated to
the women. Inquiring for Mrs. Sheppard, a
matron offered to conduct him to her cell.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll find her quiet enough to&hyphen;day, sir,&rdquo; 
observed the woman, as they walked along; 
&ldquo;but she has been very outrageous latterly.
Her nurse says she may live some time; but
she seems to me to be sinking fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help her!&rdquo; sighed Jack. &ldquo;I hope
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her release would be a mercy,&rdquo; pursued
the matron. &ldquo;Oh! sir, if you'd seen her as
I've seen her, you'd not wish her a continuance
of misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack made no reply, the woman proceeded,</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;They say her son's taken at last, and is to
be hanged. I'm glad of it, I'm sure; for it's
all owing to him his poor mother's here.
See what crime does, sir. Those who act
wickedly bring misery on all connected with
them. And so gentle as the poor creature is,
when she's not in her wild fits&mdash;it would melt
a heart of stone to see her. She will cry for
days and nights together. If Jack Sheppard</pp>
<pb n="238">
<pp>could behold his mother in this state, he'd
have a lesson he'd never forget&mdash;ay, and a
severer one than even the hangman could
read him. Hardened as he may be, that would
touch him. But he has never been near her&mdash; 
never.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Rambling in this way, the matron at
length came to a halt, and taking out a key,
pointed to a door and said, &ldquo;This is Mrs.
Sheppard's ward, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave us together, my good woman,&rdquo; said
Jack, putting a guinea into her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you please, sir,&rdquo; answered the
matron, dropping a curtsey. &ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; 
she added, unlocking the door, &ldquo;you can go
in. Don't be frightened of her. She's not
mischievous&mdash;and besides she's chained, and
can't reach you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, she retired, and Jack entered the
cell.</p>
<p><pp>Prepared as he was for a dreadful shock,
and with his nerves strung to endure it, Jack
absolutely recoiled before the appalling object
that met his gaze. Cowering in a corner upon
a heap of straw sat his unfortunate mother,</pp>
<pb n="239">
<pp>the complete wreck of what she had been. Her
eyes glistened in the darkness&mdash;for light was
only admitted through a small grated window
&mdash;like flames, and, as she fixed them on him,
their glances seemed to penetrate his very
soul. A piece of old blanket was fastened
across her shoulders, and she had no other
clothing except a petticoat. Her arms and
feet were uncovered, and of almost skeleton
thinness. Her features were meagre, and
ghastly white, and had the fixed and horrible
stamp of insanity. Her head had been shaved,
and around it was swathed a piece of rag, in
which a few straws were stuck. Her thin
fingers were armed with nails as long as the
talons of a bird. A chain, riveted to an iron
belt encircling her waist, bound her to the
wall. The cell in which she was confined was
about six feet long and four wide; the walls
were scored all over with fantastic designs,
snatches of poetry, short sentences and names,
&mdash;the work of its former occupants, and of its
present inmate.</pp></p>
<p><pp>When Jack entered the cell, she was talking
to herself in the muttering unconnected</pp>
<pb n="240">
<pp>way peculiar to her distracted condition; but,
after her eye had rested on him some time, the
fixed expression of her features relaxed, and a
smile crossed them. This smile was more harrowing
even than her former rigid look.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an angel,&rdquo; she cried, with a look
beaming with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a devil,&rdquo; groaned her son, &ldquo;to
have done this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an angel, I say,&rdquo; continued the
poor maniac; &ldquo;and my Jack would have been
like you, if he had lived. But he died when he
was a child&mdash;long ago&mdash;long ago&mdash;long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he had done so!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Van told me if he grew up he would
be hanged. He showed me a black mark under
his ear, where the noose would be tied. And
so I'll tell you what I did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she burst into a laugh that froze Jack's
blood in his veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; he asked, in a broken
voice.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I strangled him&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;strangled
him while he was at my breast&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;&mdash; 
And then with a sudden and fearful change of</pp>
<pb n="241">
<pp>look, she added, &ldquo;That's what has driven
me mad. I killed my child to save him from
the gallows&mdash;oh! oh! One man hanged in a
family is enough. If I'd not gone mad, they
would have hanged me.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul!&rdquo; ejaculated her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you a dream I had last night,&rdquo; 
continued the unfortunate being. &ldquo;I was at
Tyburn. There was a gallows erected, and a
great mob round it&mdash;thousands of people, and
all with white faces like corpses. In the midst
of them there was a cart with a man in it&mdash; 
and that man was Jack&mdash;my son Jack&mdash;they
were going to hang him. And opposite to
him, with a book in his hand,&mdash;but it could'nt
be a prayer&hyphen;book,&mdash;sat Jonathan Wild, in a
parson's cassock and band. I knew him in
spite of his dress. And when they came to
the gallows, Jack leaped out of the cart, and
the hangman tied up Jonathan instead&mdash;ha!
ha! How the mob shouted and huzzaed&mdash;and
I shouted too&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Jack, unable to endure
this agonizing scene longer. &ldquo;Don't you know
me, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="242">
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;What's
that?&mdash;Jack's voice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ceiling is breaking! the floor is opening!
he is coming to me!&rdquo; cried the unhappy
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stands before you,&rdquo; rejoined her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I can't see him.
Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you his ghost, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I am your
most unhappy son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me touch you, then; let me feel if
you are really flesh and blood,&rdquo; cried the poor
maniac, creeping towards him on all fours.</p>
<p>Jack did not advance to meet her. He could
not move; but stood like one stupified, with
his hands clasped together, and eyes almost
starting out of their sockets, fixed upon his
unfortunate parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me!&rdquo; cried the poor maniac, who
had crawled as far as the chain would permit
her,&mdash;&ldquo;come to me!&rdquo; she cried, extending her
thin arm towards him.</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>388Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010119">
<pb n="243">
<p>Jack fell on his knees beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Sheppard,
passing her hands over his face, and gazing
at him with a look that made him shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son,&rdquo; replied Jack,&mdash;&ldquo;your miserable,
repentant son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;You
are not. Jack was not half your age when he
died. They buried him in Willesden churchyard
after the robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;she does not
know me. Mother&mdash;dear mother!&rdquo; he added,
clasping her in his arms. &ldquo;Look at me
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off!&rdquo; she exclaimed, breaking from his
embrace with a scream. &ldquo;Don't touch me.
I'll be quiet. I'll not speak of Jack or Jonathan.
I won't dig their graves with my nails. Don't
strip me quite. Leave me my blanket! I'm
very cold at night. Or, if you must take off my
clothes, don't dash cold water on my head.
It throbs cruelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horror!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Don't scourge me,&rdquo; she cried, trying to
hide herself in the farthest corner of the cell.</pp>
<pb n="244">
<pp>&ldquo;The lash cuts to the bone. I can't bear it.
Spare me, and I'll be quiet&mdash;quiet&mdash;quiet!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; said Jack, advancing towards
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off!&rdquo; she cried with a prolonged and
piercing shriek. And she buried herself beneath
the straw, which she tossed above her
head with the wildest gestures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall kill her if I stay longer,&rdquo; muttered
her son, completely terrified.</p>
<p>While he was considering what would be
best to do, the poor maniac, over whose bewildered
brain another change had come,
raised her head from under the straw, and,
peeping round the room, asked in a low voice,
&ldquo;If they were gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nurses,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they treat you ill?&rdquo; asked her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said, putting her lean fingers
to her lips. &ldquo;Hush!&mdash;come hither, and I'll
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack approached her.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Sit beside me,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Sheppard.</pp>
<pb n="245">
<pp>&ldquo;And, now I'll tell you what they do. Stop!
we must shut the door, or they'll catch us.
See!&rdquo; she added, tearing the rag from her
head,&mdash;&ldquo;I had beautiful black hair once. But
they cut it all off.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go mad myself if I listen to her
longer,&rdquo; said Jack, attempting to rise. &ldquo;I
must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't stir, or they'll chain you to the wall,&rdquo; 
said his mother detaining him. &ldquo;Now, tell me
why they brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see you, dear mother!&rdquo; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; she echoed,&mdash;&ldquo;mother! why do
you call me by that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed, staring eagerly
in his face. &ldquo;Are you my son? Are you
Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Heaven be praised
she knows me at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; cried his mother, falling upon
his neck, and covering him with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&mdash;dear mother!&rdquo; said Jack, bursting
into tears.</p>
<pb n="246">
<p>&ldquo;You will never leave me,&rdquo; sobbed the poor
woman, straining him to her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely pronounced, when
the door was violently thrown open, and two
men appeared at it. They were Jonathan Wild
and Quilt Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, starting to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; said the thieftaker. &ldquo;You
are my prisoner, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall take my life first,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard.</p>
<p>And, as he was about to put himself into a
posture of defence, his mother clasped him in
her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall not harm you, my love!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>The movement was fatal to her son. Taking
advantage of his embarrassed position, Jonathan
and his assistant rushed upon him, and
disarmed him.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; cried the
thieftaker, as he slipped a pair of handcuffs over
Jack's wrists, &ldquo;for the help you have given us</pp>
<pb n="247">
<pp>in capturing your son. Without you, we might
have had some trouble.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Aware, apparently in some degree, of the
mistake she had committed, the poor maniac
sprang towards him with frantic violence, and
planted her long nails in his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off, you accursed jade!&rdquo; roared
Jonathan,&mdash;&ldquo;Keep off, I say, or&mdash;&rdquo; And he
struck her a violent blow with his clenched
hand.</p>
<p>The miserable woman staggered, uttered a
deep groan, and fell senseless on the straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil!&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;that blow shall cost
you your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It'll not need to be repeated, at all events,&rdquo; 
rejoined Jonathan, looking with a smile of
malignant satisfaction at the body. &ldquo;And, now,
&mdash;to Newgate.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>At</smallcap> the beginning of the twelfth century,&mdash; 
whether in the reign of Henry the First, or
Stephen is uncertain,&mdash;a fifth gate was added to
the four principal entrances of the city of London; 
then, it is almost needless to say, surrounded
by ramparts, moats, and other defences.
This gate, called <it>Newgate</it>, &ldquo;as being latelier
builded than the rest,&rdquo; continued, for upwards
of three hundred years, to be used as a place
of imprisonment for felons and trespassers; at
the end of which time, having grown old, ruinous,
and &ldquo;horribly loathsome,&rdquo; it was rebuilt
and enlarged by the executors of the renowned
Sir Richard Whittington, <it>the</it> Lord Mayor of
London: whence it afterwards obtained amongst
a certain class of students, whose examinations
were conducted with some strictness at the
Old Bailey, and their highest degrees taken at</pp>
<pb n="249">
<pp>Hyde&hyphen;park&hyphen;corner, the appellation of Whittington's
College, or, more briefly, the Whit. It
may here be mentioned that this gate, destined
to bequeath its name&mdash;a name, which has since
acquired a terrible significance,&mdash;to every successive
structure erected upon its site, was
granted, in 1400, by charter by Henry the
Sixth to the citizens of London, in return for
their royal services, and thenceforth became the
common gaol to that city and the country of
Middlesex. Nothing material occurred to Newgate,
until the memorable year 1666, when it
was utterly destroyed by the Great Fire. It is
with the building raised after this direful calamity
that our history has to deal.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Though by no means so extensive or commodious
as the modern prison, Old Newgate was
a large and strongly&hyphen;built pile. The body of
the edifice stood on the south side of Newgate
Street, and projected at the western extremity
far into the area opposite Saint Sepulchre's
Church. One small wing lay at the north of
the gate, where Giltspur Street Computer now
stands; and the Press Yard, which was detached
from the main building, was situated at the</pp>
<pb n="250">
<pp>back of Ph&oelig;nix Court. The south or principal
front, looking <it>down</it> the Old Bailey, and not
<it>upon it</it>, as is the case of the present structure,
with its massive walls of roughened free&hyphen;stone,
&mdash;in some places darkened by the smoke, in
others blanched, by exposure to the weather,&mdash; 
its heavy projecting cornice, its unglazed
doubly&hyphen;grated windows, its gloomy porch decorated
with fetters, and defended by an enormous
iron door, had a stern and striking effect. Over
the Lodge, upon a dial was inscribed the appropriate
motto, &ldquo;<it>Venio sicut fur.</it>&rdquo; The Gate,
which crossed Newgate Street, had a wide arch
for carriages, and a postern, on the north side,
for foot&hyphen;passengers. Its architecture was richly
ornamental, and resembled the style of a triumphal
entrance to a capital, rather than a dungeon,
having battlements and hexagonal towers,
and being adorned on the western side with a
triple range of pilasters of the Tuscan order,
amid the intercolumniations of which were
niches embellished with statues. The chief of
these was a figure of Liberty, with a cat at her
feet, in allusion to the supposed origin of the
fortunes of its former founder, Sir Richard Wittington.</pp>
<pb n="251">
<pp>On the right of the postern against
the wall was affixed a small grating, sustaining
the debtor's box; and any pleasure which the
passer&hyphen;by might derive from contemplating the
splendid structure above described was damped
at beholding the pale faces and squalid figures
of the captives across the bars of its strongly&hyphen;grated
windows. Some years after the date of
this history, an immense ventilator was placed
at the top of the Gate, with the view of purifying
the prison, which, owing to its insufficient
space and constantly&hyphen;crowded state, was never
free from that dreadful and contagious disorder,
now happily unknown, the gaol&hyphen;fever. So
frightful, indeed, were the ravages of this malady,
to which debtors and felons were alike exposed,
that its miserable victims were frequently
carried out by cart&hyphen;loads, and thrown into a
pit in the burial&hyphen;ground of Christ&hyphen;church, without
ceremony.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Old Newgate was divided into three separate
prisons,&mdash;the Master's Side, the Common Side,
and the Press Yard. The first of these, situated
at the south of the building, with the exception
of one ward over the gateway, was allotted</pp>
<pb n="252">
<pp>to the better class of debtors, whose funds enabled
them to defray their chamber&hyphen;rent, fees,
and garnish. The second, comprising the bulk
of the gaol, and by many degrees worse in point
of accommodation, having several dismal and
noisome wards under ground, was common
both to debtors and malefactors,&mdash;an association
little favourable to the morals or comforts
of the former, who, if they were brought there
with any notions of honesty, seldom left with
untainted principles. The last,&mdash;in all respects
the best and airiest of the three, standing, as has
been before observed, in Ph&oelig;nix Court, at the
rear of the main fabric,&mdash;was reserved for state&hyphen; 
offenders, and such persons as chose to submit
to the extortionate demands of the keeper: from
twenty to five hundred pounds premium, according
to the rank and means of the applicant,
in addition to a high weekly rent, being required
for accommodation in this quarter. Some excuse
for this rapacity may perhaps be found in
the fact, that five thousand pounds was paid for
the purchase of the Press Yard by Mr. Pitt,
the then governor of Newgate. This gentleman,
tried for high treason, in 1716, on suspicion of</pp>
<pb n="253">
<pp>aiding Mr. Forster, the rebel general's escape
but acquitted, reaped a golden harvest during
the occupation of his premises by the Preston
rebels, when a larger sum was obtained for a
single chamber than (in the words of a sufferer
on the occasion) &ldquo;would have paid the rent of
the best house in Saint James's Square or Piccadilly
for several years.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>Nor was this all. Other, and more serious
impositions, inasmuch as they affected a poorer
class of persons, were practised by the underlings
of the gaol. On his first entrance, a
prisoner, if unable or unwilling to comply with
the exactions of the turnkeys, was thrust into
the Condemned Hold with the worst description
of criminals, and terrified by threats into
submission. By the old regulations, the free
use of strong liquors not being interdicted, a
tap&hyphen;house was kept in the Lodge, and also in a
cellar on the Common Side,&mdash;under the superintendence
of Mrs. Spurling, formerly, it may
be remembered, the hostess of the Dark House
at Queenhithe,&mdash;whence wine, ale, and brandy
of inferior quality were dispensed, in false</pp>
<pb n="254">
<pp>measures, and at high prices, throughout the
prison, which in noise and debauchery rivalled,
if it did not surpass, the lowest tavern.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The chief scene of these disgusting orgies,&mdash; 
the cellar, just referred to,&mdash;was a large low&hyphen;roofed
vault, about four feet below the level of
the street, perfectly dark, unless when illumined
by a roaring fire, and candles stuck in pyramidal
lumps of clay, with a range of butts and
barrels at one end, and benches and tables at
the other, where the prisoners, debtors and
malefactors, male and female, assembled as
long as their money lasted, and consumed the
time in drinking, smoking, and gaming with
cards and dice. Above was a spacious hall,
connected with it by a flight of stone steps, at
the further end of which stood an immense
grated door, called in the slang of the place
&ldquo;The Jigger,&rdquo; through the bars of which the
felons in the upper wards were allowed to converse
with their friends, or if they wished to
enter the room, or join the revellers below, they
were at liberty to do so, on payment of a small
fine. Thus, the same system of plunder was</pp>
<pb n="255">
<pp>every where carried on. The gaolers robbed
the prisoners: the prisoners robbed one
another.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Two large wards were situated in the Gate; 
one of which, the Stone Ward, appropriated to
the master debtors, looked towards Holborn; 
the other called the Stone Hall, from a huge
stone standing in the middle of it, upon which
the irons of criminals under sentence of death
were knocked off previously to their being
taken to the place of execution, faced Newgate&hyphen;street.
Here the prisoners took exercise; and
a quaint, but striking picture has been left of
their appearance when so engaged, by the
author of the English Rogue. &ldquo;At my first
being acquainted with the place,&rdquo; says this
writer, in the &lsquo;Miseries of a Prison,&rsquo; &ldquo;the prisoners,
methought, walking up and down the
Stone Hall, looked like so many wrecks upon
the sea. Here the ribs of a thousand pounds
beating against the Needles&mdash;those dangerous
rocks, credulity; here floated, to and fro, silks,
stuffs, camlets, and velvet, without giving place
to each other, according to their dignity; here
rolled so many pipes of canary, whose bungholes</pp>
<pb n="256">
<pp>lying open, were so damaged that the
merchant may go hoop for his money.&rdquo; A less
picturesque, but more truthful, and, therefore,
more melancholy description of the same scene,
is furnished by the shrewd and satirical Ned
Ward, who informs us, in the &ldquo;Delectable History
of Whittington's College,&rdquo; that &ldquo;When
the prisoners are disposed to recreate themselves
with walking, they go up into a spacious
room, called the Stone Hall; where, when you
see them taking a turn together, it would
puzzle one to know which is the gentleman,
which the mechanic, and which the beggar, for
they are all suited in the same garb of squalid
poverty, making a spectacle of more pity than
executions; only to be out at the elbows is in
fashion here, and a great indecorum not to be
threadbare.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>In an angle of the Stone Hall was the Iron
Hold, a chamber containing a vast assortment
of fetters and handcuffs of all weights and
sizes. Four prisoners, termed &ldquo;The Partners,&rdquo; 
had charge of this hold. Their duty was to
see who came in, or went out; to lock up, and
open the different wards; to fetter such prisoners</pp>
<pb n="257">
<pp>as were ordered to be placed in irons; 
to distribute the allowances of provision; and
to maintain some show of decorum; for which
latter purpose they were allowed to carry whips
and truncheons. When any violent outrage
was committed,&mdash;and such matters were of
daily, sometimes hourly, occurrence,&mdash;a bell
the rope of which descended into the hall,
assistance. A narrow passage at the north of
the Stone Hall led to the Bluebeard's room of
this enchanted castle, a place shunned even by
the reckless crew who were compelled to pass
it. It was a sort of cooking&hyphen;room, with an
immense fire&hyphen;place flanked by a couple of cauldrons,
and was called Jack Ketch's Kitchen,
because the quarters of persons executed for
treason were there boiled by the hangman in
oil, pitch, and tar, before they were affixed on
the city gates, or on London Bridge. Above
this revolting spot was the female debtor's
ward; below it a gloomy cell, called Tangier; 
and noisome dungeon, situated underground,
and unvisited by a single ray of daylight. Built</pp>
<pb n="258">
<pp>and paved with stone, without beds, or any
other sort of protection from the cold, this
dreadful hole, accounted the most dark and
dismal in the prison, was made the receptacle
of such miserable wretches as could not pay
the customary fees. Adjoining it was the
Lower Ward,&mdash;&ldquo;Though, in what degree of
latitude it was situated,&rdquo; observes Ned Ward,
&ldquo;I cannot positively demonstrate, unless it lay
ninety degrees beyond the North Pole; for,
instead of being dark there but half a year, it
is dark all the year round.&rdquo; It was only a
shade better than the Stone Hold. Here were
imprisoned the fines; and, &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; adds
the before&hyphen;cited authority, &ldquo;if he behaved himself,
an outlawed person might creep in among
them.&rdquo; Ascending the gate once more on the
way back, we find over the Stone Hall another
large room, called Debtors' Hall, facing Newgate&hyphen;street,
with &ldquo;very good air and light,&rdquo; A
little too much of the former, perhaps; as the
windows being unglazed, the prisoners were
subjected to sever annoyance from the weather
and easterly winds.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Of the women felon's rooms nothing has yet</pp>
<pb n="259">
<pp>been said. There were two. One called
Waterman's Hall, a horrible place adjoining
the postern under the gate, whence, through a
small barred aperture, they solicited alms from
the passengers: the other, a large chamber,
denominated My Lady's Hold, was situated in
the highest part of the gaol, at the northern
extremity. Neither of these wards had beds,
and the unfortunate inmates were obliged to
take their rest on the oaken floor. The condition
of the rooms was indescribably filthy and
disgusting; nor were the habits of the occupants
much more cleanly. In other respects,
they were equally indecorous and offensive.
&ldquo;It is with no small concern,&rdquo; writes an anonymous
historian of Newgate, &ldquo;that I am
obliged to observe that the women in every
ward of this prison are exceedingly worse than
the worst of the men, not only in respect to
their mode of living, but more especially as to
their conversation, which, to their great shame,
is as profane and wicked as hell itself can possibly
be.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>There were two Condemned Holds,&mdash;one for</pp>
<pb n="260">
<pp>each sex. That for the men lay near the
Lodge, with which it was connected by a dark
passage. It was a large room, about twenty
feet long and fifteen broad, and had an arched
stone roof. In fact, it had been anciently the
right hand postern under the gate leading towards
the city. The floor was planked with
oak, and covered with iron staples, hooks, and
ring&hyphen;bolts, with heavy chains attached to them.
There was only one small grated window in this
hold, which admitted but little light.</pp></p>
<p>Over the gateway towards Snow Hill were
two strong wards, called the Castle and the
Red Room. They will claim particular attention
hereafter.</p>
<p><pp>Many other wards,&mdash;especially on the Master
Debtor's side,&mdash;have been necessarily
omitted in the foregoing hasty enumeration.
But there were two places of punishment which
merit some notice from their peculiarity. The
first of these, the Press Room, a dark close
chamber, near Waterman's Hall obtained its
name from an immense wooden machine kept
in it, with which such prisoners as refused to</pp>
<pb n="261">
<pp>plead to their indictments were pressed to
death&mdash;a species of inquisitorial torture not
discontinued until so lately as the early part of
the reign of George the Third, when it was
abolished by an express statute. Into the
second, denominated the Bilbowes,&mdash;also a dismal
place,&mdash;refractory prisoners were thrust,
and placed in a kind of stocks, whence the
name.</pp></p>
<p>The Chapel was situated in the south&hyphen;east
angle of the gaol; the ordinary at the time of
this history being the Reverend Thomas Purney; 
the deputy chaplain, Mr. Wagstaff.</p>
<p><pp>Much has been advanced by modern writers
respecting the demoralising effect of prison
society; and it has been asserted, that a youth
once confined in Newgate, is certain to come
out a confirmed thief. However this may be
now, it was unquestionably true of old Newgate.
It was the grand nursery of vice,&mdash;&ldquo;a
famous university,&rdquo; observes Ned Ward, in the
London Spy, &ldquo;where, if a man has a mind to
educate a hopeful child in the daring science of
padding; the light&hyphen;fingered subtlety of shoplifting;</pp>
<pb n="262">
<pp>the excellent use of jack and crow; for
the silently drawing bolts, and forcing barricades; 
with the knack of sweetening; or the
most ingenious dexterity of picking pockets; 
let him but enter in this college on the
Common Side, and confine him close to his
study but for three months; and if he does not
come out qualified to take any degree of villainy,
he must be the most honest dunce that
ever had the advantage of such eminent
tutors.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>To bring down this imperfect sketch of
Newgate to the present time, it may be mentioned
that, being found inadequate to the
purpose required, the old gaol was pulled down
in 1770. Just at the completion of the new
gaol, in 1780, it was assailed by the mob during
the Gordon riots, fired, and greatly damaged.
The devastations, however, were speedily made
good; and, in two years more, it was finished.</p>
<p><pp>It is a cheering reflection, that in the present
prison, with its clean, well&hyphen;whitewashed, and
well&hyphen;ventilated wards, its airy courts, its infirmary,
its improved regulations, and its humane</pp>
<pb n="263">
<pp>and intelligent officers, many of the miseries of
the old gaol are removed. The these beneficial
changes society is mainly indebted to the
unremitting exertions of the philanthropic
<smallcap>Howard.</smallcap></pp></p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Monday</smallcap>, the 31st of August 1724,&mdash;a day
long afterwards remembered by the officers
of Newgate,&mdash;was distinguished by an unusual
influx of visitors to the Lodge. On that morning
the dead warrant had arrived from Windsor,
ordering Sheppard for execution, (since
his capture by Jonathan Wild in Bedlam, as
related in a former chapter, Jack had been
tried, convicted, and sentenced to death,)
together with three malefactors, on the
following Friday. Up to this moment, hopes
had been entertained of a respite, strong representations
in his favour having been made
in the highest quarter; but now that his fate
seemed sealed, the curiosity of the sight&hyphen;seeing
public to behold him was redoubled. The
prison gates were besieged like the entrance of
a booth at a fair; and the Condemned Hold,</pp>
<pb n="265">
<pp>where he was confined, and to which visitors
were admitted at the moderate rate of a guinea
a&hyphen;head, had quite the appearance of a showroom.
As the day wore on, the crowds diminished,
&mdash;many who would not submit to the
turnkey's demands were sent away ungratified,
&mdash;and at five o'clock, only two strangers, Mr.
Shotbolt, the head turnkey of Clerkenwell
Prison, and Mr. Griffin, who held the same
office in Westminster Gatehouse, were left in
the Lodge. Jack, who had formerly been in
the custody of both these gentlemen, gave them
a very cordial welcome; apologized for the
sorry room he was compelled to receive them
in; and when they took leave, insisted on
treating them to a double bowl of punch, which
they were now discussing with the upper
gaoler, Mr. Ireton, and his two satellites, Austin
and Langley. At a little distance from the
party, sat a tall, sinister&hyphen;looking personage,
with harsh inflexible features, a gaunt but muscular
frame, and large bony hands. He was
sipping a glass of cold gin and water, and
smoking a short black pipe. His name was</pp>
<pb n="266">
<pp>Marvel, and his avocation, which was as repulsive
as his looks, was that of public executioner.
By his side sat a remarkably stout dame, to
whom he paid as much attention as it was in his
iron nature to pay. She had a nut&hyphen;brown
skin, a swarthy upper lip, a merry black eye, a
prominent bust, and a tun&hyphen;like circumference of
waist. A widow for the fourth time, Mrs. Spurling,
(for she it was,) either by her attractions
of purse or person, had succeeded in moving the
stony heart of Mr. Marvel, who, as he had
helped to deprive her of her former husbands,
thought himself in duty bound to offer to supply
their place. But the lady was not so easily
won; and though she did not absolutely reject
him, gave him very slight hopes. Mr. Marvel,
therefore, remained on his probation. Behind
Mrs. Spurling stood her negro attendant,
Caliban; a hideous, misshapen, malicious
monster, with broad hunched shoulders, a flat
nose, and ears like those of a wild beast, a
head too large for his body, and a body
too long for his legs. This horrible piece of
deformity, who acted as drawer and cellarman,</pp>
<pb n="267">
<pp>and was a constant butt to the small wits
of the gaol, was nicknamed the Black Dog of
Newgate.</pp></p>
<p><pp>In the general survey of the prison, taken in
the preceding chapter, but little was said of the
Lodge. It may be well, therefore, before proceeding
farther, to describe it more minutely.
It was approached from the street by a flight
of broad stone steps, leading to a ponderous
door, plated with iron, and secured on the
inner side by huge bolts, and a lock, with
wards of a prodigious size. A little within
stood a second door, or rather wicket, lower
than the first, but of equal strength, and surmounted
by a row of sharp spikes. As no
apprehension was entertained of an escape by
this outlet,&mdash;nothing of the kind having been
attempted by the boldest felon ever incarcerated
in Newgate,&mdash;both doors were generally
left open during the day&hyphen;time. At six o'clock,
the wicket was shut; and at nine, the gaol
was altogether locked up. Not far from the
entrance, on the left, was a sort of screen, or
partition&hyphen;wall, reaching from the floor to the
ceiling, formed of thick oaken planks riveted</pp>
<pb n="268">
<pp>together by iron bolts, and studded with broadheaded
nails. In this screen which masked the
entrance of a dark passage communicating with
the Condemned Hold, about five feet from the
ground, was a hatch, protected by long spikes
set six inches apart, and each of the thickness
of an elephant's tusk. The spikes almost
touched the upper part of the hatch: scarcely
space enough for the passage of a hand being
left between their points and the beam. Here,
as has already been observed, condemned malefactors
were allowed to converse with such of
their guests as had not interest or money
enough to procure admission to them in the
hold. Beyond the hatch, an angle, formed by
a projection in the wall of some three or four
feet, served to hide a door conducting to the
interior of the prison. At the farther end of
the Lodge, the floor was raised to the height of
a couple of steps; whence the whole place,
with the exception of the remotest corner of
the angle before&hyphen;mentioned, could be commanded
at a single glance. On this elevation a
table was now placed, around which sat the
turnkeys and their guests, regaling themselves
on the fragrant beverage provided by the prisoner.</pp>
<pb n="269">
<pp>A brief description will suffice for
them. They were all stout ill&hyphen;favoured men,
attired in the regular gaol&hyphen;livery of scratch
wig and snuff&hyphen;coloured suit; and had all a
strong family likeness to each other. The only
difference between the officers of Newgate and
their brethren was, that they had enormous
bunches of keys at their girdles, while the
latter had left their keys at home.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I've seen many a gallant fellow in
my time, Mr. Ireton,&rdquo; observed the chief turnkey
of Westminster Gatehouse, as he helped
himself to his third glass of punch; &ldquo;but I
never saw one like Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; returned Ireton, following his example:
&ldquo;and I've had some experience too.
Ever since he came here, three months ago,
he has been the life and soul of the place; and
now the dead warrant has arrived, instead of
being cast down, as most men would be, and
as all others <it>are</it>, he's gayer than ever. Well,
<it>I</it> shall be sorry to lose him, Mr. Griffin.
We've made a pretty penny by him&mdash;sixty
guineas this blessed day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No more!&rdquo; cried Griffin, incredulously;</pp>
<pb n="270">
<pp>I should have thought you must have made
double that sum at least.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a farthing more, I assure you,&rdquo; rejoined
Ireton, pettishly; &ldquo;we're all on the
square here. I took the money myself, and
<it>ought</it> to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; answered Griffin; &ldquo;certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offered Jack five guineas as his share,&rdquo; 
continued Ireton; &ldquo;but he wouldn't take it
himself, and gave it to the poor debtors and
felons, who are now drinking it out in the
cellar on the Common Side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack's a noble fellow,&rdquo; exclaimed the
head&hyphen;gaoler of Clerkenwell Prison, raising his
glass; &ldquo;and, though he played me a scurvy
trick, I'll drink to his speedy deliverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Tyburn, eh, Mr. Shotbolt?&rdquo; rejoined
the executioner. &ldquo;I'll pledge you in that
toast with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Spurling,
&ldquo;I hope he may never see Tyburn.
And, if I'd my own way with the Secretary of
State, he never <it>should</it>. It's a thousand pities
to hang so pretty a fellow. There haven't</pp>
<pb n="271">
<pp>been so many ladies in the Lodge since the
days of Claude Du Val, the gentleman highwayman; 
and they all declare it'll break their
hearts if he's scragged.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; ejaculated Marvel, gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think our sex has no feeling, I suppose,
sir,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Spurling, indignantly; 
&ldquo;but I can tell you we have. And, what's
more, I tell you, if Captain Sheppard <it>is</it> hanged,
you need never hope to call <it>me</it> Mrs. Marvel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Zounds!&rdquo; cried the executioner, in astonishment.
&ldquo;Do you know what you are talking
about, Mrs. Spurling? Why, if Captain
Sheppard should get off, it 'ud be fifty guineas
out of my way. There's the grand laced coat
he wore at his trial, which I intend for my
wedding&hyphen;dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Don't mention such a thing, sir,&rdquo; interrupted
the tapstress. &ldquo;I could'nt bear to see
you in it. You're speaking of the trial brings
the whole scene to my mind. Ah! I shall
never forget the figure Jack cut on that occasion.
What a buzz of admiration ran round
the court as he appeared! And, how handsome
and composed he looked! Everybody</pp>
<pb n="272">
<pp>wondered that such a stripling could commit
such desperate robberies. His firmness never
deserted him till his old master, Mr. Wood,
was examined. Then he <it>did</it> give way a bit.
And when Mr. Wood's daughter,&mdash;to whom,
I've heard tell, he was attached years ago,&mdash; 
was brought up, his courage forsook him altogether,
and he trembled, and could scarcely
stand. Poor young lady! <it>She</it> trembled too,
and was unable to give her evidence. When
sentence was passed there wasn't a dry eye in
the court.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was one,&rdquo; observed Ireton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess who you mean,&rdquo; rejoined Shotbolt.
&ldquo;Mr. Wild's.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; answered Ireton. &ldquo;It's strange
the antipathy he bears to Sheppard. I was
standing near Jack at that awful moment, and
beheld the look Wild fixed on him. It was
like the grin of a fiend, and made my flesh
creep on my bones. When the prisoner was removed
from the dock, we met Jonathan as we
passed through the yard. He stopped us, and,
addressing Jack in a taunting tone, said,
&lsquo;Well, I've been as good as my word!&rsquo;&mdash;</pp>
<pb n="273">
<pp>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; replied Sheppard; &lsquo;and I'll be as
good as mine!&rsquo; And so they parted.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope he will, if it's anything to
Jonathan's disadvantage,&rdquo; muttered Mrs. Spurling,
half aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm surprised Mr. Wild hasn't been to inquire
after him to&hyphen;day,&rdquo; observed Langley; 
&ldquo;it's the first time he's missed doing so since
the trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's gone to Enfield after Blueskin, who
has so long eluded his vigilance,&rdquo; rejoined
Austin. &ldquo;Quilt Arnold called this morning to
say so. Certain information, it seems, has
been received from a female, that Blueskin
would be at a flash&hyphen;ken near the Chase at five
o'clock to day, and they're all set out in the
expectation of nabbing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wild had a narrow escape lately, in
that affair of Captain Darrell,&rdquo; observed Shotbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't exactly know the rights of that
affair,&rdquo; rejoined Griffin, with some curiosity.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Nor any one else, I suspect,&rdquo; answered
Ireton, winking significantly. &ldquo;It's a mysterious
transaction altogether. But, as much</pp>
<pb n="274">
<pp>as is known is this: Captain Darrell, who
resides with Mr. Wood at Dollis Hill,
was assaulted and half&hyphen;killed by a party
of ruffians, headed, he swore, by Mr. Wild,
and his uncle, Sir Rowland Trenchard. Mr.
Wild, however, proved, on the evidence of
his own servants, that he was at the Old Bailey
at the time; and Sir Rowland proved that <it>he</it>
was in Manchester. So the charge was dismissed.
Another charge was then brought against them
by the captain, who accused them of kidnapping
him when a boy, and placing him in the
hands of a Dutch skipper, named Van Galgebrok,
with instructions to throw him overboard,
which was done, though he afterwards
escaped. But this accusation, for want of sufficient
evidence, met with the same fate as the
first, and Jonathan came off victorious. It
was thought, however, if the skipper <it>could</it>
have been found, that the result of the case
would have been materially different. This
was rather too much to expect; for we all
know, if Mr. Wild wishes to keep a man out of
the way, he'll speedily find the means to do so.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; cried the gaolers, laughing.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;<it>I</it> could have given awkward evidence in</pp>
<pb n="275">
<pp>that case, if I'd been so inclined,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Spurling, &ldquo;ay and found Van Galgebrok too.
But I never betray an old customer.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wild is a great man,&rdquo; said the hangman,
replenishing his pipe, &ldquo;and we owe him
much, and ought to support him. Were any
thing to happen to him, Newgate wouldn't be
what it is, nor Tyburn either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wild has given you some employment,
Mr. Marvel,&rdquo; remarked Shotbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, sir,&rdquo; replied the executioner, with
a grim smile. &ldquo;Out of the twelve hundred
subjects I've tucked up, I may safely place
half to his account. If ever he requires my
services, he shall find I'm not ungrateful.
And though I say it that shouldn't say it, no
man can tie a better knot. Mr. Wild, gentlemen,
and the nubbin'&hyphen;cheat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Fill your glasses, gentlemen,&rdquo; observed
Ireton, &ldquo;and I'll tell you a droll thing Jack said
this morning. Amongst others who came to see
him, was a Mr. Kneebone, a woollen&hyphen;draper in
Wych Street, with whose pockets, it appears,
Jack, when a lad, made a little too free. As
this gentleman was going away, he said to Jack</pp>
<pb n="276">
<pp>in a jesting manner, &lsquo;that he should be glad
to see him to&hyphen;night at supper.&rsquo; Upon which
the other answered, &lsquo;that he accepted his invitation
with pleasure, and would make a point
of waiting upon him.&rsquo; Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>Did</it> he say so?&rdquo; cried Shotbolt. &ldquo;Then I
advise you to look sharply after him, Mr. Ireton; 
for may I be hanged myself if I don't
believe he'll be as good as his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, two women, very smartly
attired in silk hoods and cloaks, appeared at
the door of the Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! who have we here?&rdquo; exclaimed Griffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Jack's two wives&mdash;Edgeworth Bess
and Poll Maggot,&rdquo; replied Austin, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can't go into the Condemned Hold,&rdquo; 
said Ireton, consequentially; &ldquo;it's against Mr.
Wild's orders. They must see the prisoner at
the hatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied Austin, rising and
walking towards them. &ldquo;Well, my pretty
dears,&rdquo; he added,&mdash;&ldquo;come to see your husband,
eh? You must make the most of your time.
You won't have him long. You've heard the
news, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="277">
<p>&ldquo;That the dead warrant's arrived,&rdquo; returned
Edgeworth Bess, bursting into a flood of tears; 
&ldquo;oh, yes! we've heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does Jack bear it?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Maggot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a hero,&rdquo; answered Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he would,&rdquo; replied the Amazon.
&ldquo;Come, Bess,&mdash;no whimpering. Don't unman
him. Are we to see him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, lose no time in bringing him
to us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maggot. There's a guinea
to drink our health,&rdquo; she added, slipping a
piece of money into his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Caliban,&rdquo; shouted the under&hyphen;turnkey,
&ldquo;unlock Captain Sheppard's padlock, and tell
him his wives are in the Lodge waiting to see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iss, Massa Austin,&rdquo; replied the black. And
taking the keys, he departed on the errand.</p>
<p><pp>As soon as he was gone, the two women
divested themselves of their hoods and cloaks,
and threw them, as if inadvertently, into the
farthest part of the angle in the wall. Their
beautifully proportioned figures and rather overdisplayed</pp>
<pb n="278">
<pp>shoulders attracted the notice of
Austin, who inquired of the chief turnkey
&ldquo;whether he should stand by them during the
interview?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! never mind them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Spurling,
who had been hastily compounding another
bowl of punch. &ldquo;Sit down, and enjoy yourself.
I'll keep a look out that nothing happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Caliban had returned, and Jack
appeared at the hatch. He was wrapped in a
loose dressing&hyphen;gown of light material, and stood
near the corner where the women's dresses
had just been thrown down, quite out of sight
of all the party, except Mrs. Spurling, who sat
on the right of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got Jonathan out of the way?&rdquo; 
he asked, in an eager whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied Edgeworth Bess. &ldquo;Patience
Kite has lured him to Enfield on a false
scent after Blueskin. You need fear no interruption
from him, or any of his myrmidons.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That's well!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Now stand
before me, Poll. I've got the watch&hyphen;spring
saw in my sleeve. Pretend to weep both of</pp>
<pb n="279">
<pp>you as loudly as you can. This spike is more
than half cut through. I was at work at it
yesterday and the day before. Keep up the
clamour for five minutes, and I'll finish it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Thus urged, the damsels began to raise their
voices in loud lamentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil are you howling about?&rdquo; 
cried Langley. &ldquo;Do you think we are to be
disturbed in this way? Make less noise,
hussies, or I'll turn you out of the Lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame, Mr. Langley,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs.
Spurling: &ldquo;I blush for you, sir! To call
yourself a man, and interfere with the natural
course of affection! Have you no feeling
for the situation of those poor disconsolate
creatures, about to be bereaved of all they hold
dear? Is it nothing to part with a husband to
the gallows? I've lost four in the same way,
and know what it is.&rdquo; Here she began to
blubber loudly for sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfort yourself, my charmer,&rdquo; said Mr.
Marvel, in a tone intended to be consolatory.
&ldquo;I'll be their substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>You</it>!&rdquo; cried the tapstress, with a look of
horror: &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="280">
<p>&ldquo;Confusion!&rdquo; muttered Jack, suddenly
pausing in his task, &ldquo;the saw has broken just
as I am through the spike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't we break it off?&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Maggot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; replied Jack, despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's try, at all events,&rdquo; returned the
Amazon.</p>
<p>And grasping the thick iron rod, she pushed
with all her force against it, while Jack seconded
her efforts from within. After great
exertions on both parts, the spike yielded to
their combined strength, and snapped suddenly off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa&mdash;what's that?&rdquo; cried Austin, starting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my darbies,&rdquo; returned Jack, clinking
his chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that was all, was it?&rdquo; said the turnkey,
quietly re&hyphen;seating himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, give me the woollen cloth to tie
round my fetters,&rdquo; whispered Sheppard.
&ldquo;Quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; replied Edgeworth Bess.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Give me your hand, Poll, to help me</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>407Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010120">
<pb n="281">
<pp>through,&rdquo; cried Jack, as he accomplished the
operation. &ldquo;Keep a sharp look out, Bess.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; interposed Edgeworth Bess; &ldquo;Mr
Langley is getting up, and coming this way.
We're lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me through at all hazards, Poll,&rdquo; 
cried Jack, straining towards the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The danger's past,&rdquo; whispered Bess.
&ldquo;Mrs. Spurling has induced him to sit down
again. Ah! she looks this way, and puts her
finger to her lips. She comprehends what
we're about. We're all safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't lose a moment then,&rdquo; cried Jack,
forcing himself into the aperture, while the
Amazon, assisted by Bess, pulled him through
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maggot, as she placed
him without noise upon the ground; &ldquo;you're
safe so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my disconsolate darlings,&rdquo; cried
Austin, &ldquo;it only wants five minutes to six. I
expect Mr. Wild here presently. Cut it as
short as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Only two minutes more, sir,&rdquo; intreated
Edgeworth Bess, advancing towards him in</pp>
<pb n="282">
<pp>such a manner as to screen Jack, who crept
into the farthest part of the angle,&mdash;&ldquo;only two
minutes, and we've done.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I'm not within a minute,&rdquo; 
rejoined the turnkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never be able to get you out unseen,
Jack,&rdquo; whispered Poll Maggot. &ldquo;You
must make a bold push.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; replied Sheppard, in the
same tone. &ldquo;That would be certain destruction.
I can't run in these heavy fetters. No:
I must face it out. Tell Bess to slip out, and
I'll put on her cloak and hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the party at the table continued
drinking and chatting as merrily as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't help thinking of Jack Sheppard's
speech to Mr. Kneebone,&rdquo; observed Shotbolt,
as he emptied his tenth tumbler; &ldquo;I'm sure
he's meditating an escape, and hopes to accomplish
it to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Poh! poh!&rdquo; rejoined Ireton; it was mere
idle boasting. I examined the Condemned
Hold myself carefully this morning, and didn't
find a nail out of its place. Recollect, he's
chained to the ground by a great horse&hyphen;padlock,</pp>
<pb n="283">
<pp>and is never unloosed except when he
comes to that hatch. If he escapes at all, it
must be before our faces.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn't surprise me if he did,&rdquo; remarked
Griffin. &ldquo;He's audacity enough for
anything. He got out in much the same way
from the Gatehouse,&mdash;stole the keys, and passed
through a room where I was sitting halfasleep
in a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught you napping, eh?&rdquo; rejoined Ireton,
with a laugh. &ldquo;Well, he won't do that here.
I'll forgive him if he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; said Austin. &ldquo;We're
too wide awake for that. Ain't we, partner?&rdquo; 
he added, appealing to Langley, whom punch
had made rather dozy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; responded the lethargic
turnkey, with a yawn.</p>
<p>During this colloquy, Jack had contrived
unobserved to put on the hood and cloak, and
being about the size of the rightful owner, presented
a very tolerable resemblance to her.
This done, Edgeworth Bess, who watched her
opportunity, slipped out of the Lodge.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; exclaimed Austin, who had</pp>
<pb n="284">
<pp>caught a glimpse of her departing figure, &ldquo;one
of the women is gone!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; hastily interposed Mrs. Spurling; 
they're both here. Don't you see they're
putting on their cloaks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's false!&rdquo; rejoined Marvel, in a low
tone; &ldquo;I perceive what has taken place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! goodness!&rdquo; ejaculated the tapstress,
in alarm. &ldquo;You won't betray him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say the word, and I'm mum,&rdquo; returned
the executioner. &ldquo;Will you be mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a very unfair advantage to take&mdash; 
very,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Spurling; &ldquo;however, I
consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I'll lend a helping hand. I shall
lose my fees and the laced coat. But it's better
to have the bride without the weddin'
dress, than the weddin' dress without the
bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, Saint Sepulchre's clock
struck six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the wicket, Austin,&rdquo; vociferated
Ireton, in an authoritative tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye!&rdquo; cried Jack, as if taking leave
of his mistresses, &ldquo;to&hyphen;morrow, at the same
time.</p>
<pb n="285">
<p>&ldquo;We'll be punctual,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Maggot.
&ldquo;Good bye, Jack! Keep up your spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for it!&mdash;life or death!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack, assuming the gait of a female, and stepping
towards the door.</p>
<p>As Austin rose to execute his principal's
commands, and usher the women to the gate,
Mrs. Spurling and Marvel rose too. The latter
walked carelessly towards the hatch, and
leaning his back against the place whence the
spike had been removed, so as completely to
hide it, continued smoking his pipe as coolly as
if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Just as Jack gained the entrance, he heard a
man's footstep behind him, and aware that the
slightest indiscretion would betray him, he
halted, uncertain what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a minute, my dear,&rdquo; cried Austin.
&ldquo;You forget that you promised me a kiss the
last time you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't one from me do as well?&rdquo; interposed
Mrs. Maggot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; said Mrs. Spurling, hastening
to the rescue. &ldquo;I want to speak to Edgeworth
Bess myself.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="286">
<p>So saying, she planted herself between Jack
and the turnkey. It was a moment of breathless
interest to all engaged in the attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come&mdash;the kiss!&rdquo; cried Austin, endeavouring
to pass his arm familiarly round the
Amazon's waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands off!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;or you'll
repent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what'll you do?&rdquo; demanded the
turnkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teach you to keep your distance!&rdquo; retorted
Mrs. Maggot, dealing him a buffet that sent
him reeling several yards backwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! off with you!&rdquo; whispered Mrs.
Spurling, squeezing Jack's arm, and pushing
him towards the door, &ldquo;and, don't come here
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Austin could recover himself, Jack
and Mrs. Maggot had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolt the wicket!&rdquo; shouted Ireton, who,
with the others, had been not a little entertained
by the gallant turnkey's discomfiture.</p>
<p><pp>This was done, and Austin returned with a
crest&hyphen;fallen look to the table. Upon which</pp>
<pb n="287">
<pp>Mrs. Spurling, and her now accepted suitor,
resumed their seats.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll be as good as your word, my
charmer,&rdquo; whispered the executioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; responded the widow, heaving
a deep sigh. &ldquo;Oh! Jack! Jack!&mdash;you little
know what a price I've paid for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I'm glad those women are gone,&rdquo; 
remarked Shotbolt. &ldquo;Coupling their presence
with Jack's speech, I couldn't help fearing
some mischief might ensue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me he's still at large,&rdquo; returned
Ireton. &ldquo;Here, Caliban, go and fasten
his padlock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iss, Massa Ireton,&rdquo; replied the black.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Stop, Caliban,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Spurling,
who wished to protract the discovery of the
escape as long as possible. &ldquo;Before you go,
bring me the bottle of pine&hyphen;apple rum I opened
yesterday. I should like Mr. Ireton and his
friends to taste it. It is in the lower cupboard.
Oh! you haven't got the key&mdash;then <it>I</it> must
have it, I suppose. How provoking!&rdquo; she
added, pretending to rummage her pockets;</pp>
<pb n="288">
<pp>&ldquo;one never <it>can</it> find a thing when one wants
it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind it, my dear Mrs. Spurling,&rdquo; 
rejoined Ireton; &ldquo;we can taste the rum when
he returns. We shall have Mr. Wild here presently,
and I wouldn't for the world&mdash;Zounds!&rdquo; 
he exclaimed, as the figure of the thieftaker
appeared at the wicket, &ldquo;here he is. Off with
you, Caliban! Fly, you rascal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wild here!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Spurling
in alarm. &ldquo;Oh gracious! he's lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who's lost?&rdquo; demanded Ireton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key,&rdquo; replied the widow.</p>
<p>All the turnkeys rose to salute the thieftaker,
whose habitually&hyphen;sullen countenance looked
gloomier than usual. Ireton rushed forward to
open the wicket for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Blueskin, I perceive, sir,&rdquo; he observed,
in a deferential tone, as Wild entered the
Lodge.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, moodily. I've
been deceived by false information. But the
wench who tricked me shall bitterly repent it.
I hope this is all. I begin to fear I might be</pp>
<pb n="289">
<pp>purposely got out of the way. Nothing has
gone wrong here?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; replied Ireton. &ldquo;Jack
is just gone back to the Condemned Hold.
His two wives have been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan, with a sudden
vehemence that electrified the chief turnkey; 
&ldquo;what's this! a spike gone! 'Sdeath! the
women, you say, have been here. He has
escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible, sir,&rdquo; replied Ireton, greatly
alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; echoed Wild, with a fearful
imprecation. &ldquo;No, sir, it's quite possible&mdash; 
more than possible. It's certain. I'll lay my
life he's gone. Come with me to the Condemned
Hold directly, and, if I find my fears
confirmed, I'll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was here interrupted by the sudden
entrance of the black, who rushed precipitately
into the room, letting fall the heavy bunch of
keys in his fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Massa Ireton! Massa Wild!&rdquo; ejaculated
Caliban, &ldquo;Shack Sheppart gone!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="290">
<p>&ldquo;Gone? you black devil!&mdash;Gone?&rdquo; cried
Ireton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iss, Massa. Caliban sarch ebery hole in
de place, but Shack no dere. Only him big
hoss padlock&mdash;noting else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; rejoined Wild, with concentrated
rage; &ldquo;and he escaped you all in broad
day, before your faces. You may well say it's
impossible! His Majesty's goal of Newgate is
admirably guarded, I must say. Ireton, you
are in league with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the chief turnkey, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <it>are</it>, sir,&rdquo; thundered Jonathan; &ldquo;and,
unless you find him, you shan't hold your
place a week. I don't threaten idly, as you
know. And you, Austin; and you Langley
I say the same thing to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Wild,&rdquo; implored the turnkeys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've said it,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan, peremptorily.
&ldquo;And you, Marvel, you must have
been a party&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he's not found, I'll get a new hangman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; cried marvel, &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="291">
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered the tapstress, &ldquo;or I
retract my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Spurling,&rdquo; said Jonathan, who overheard
the whisper, &ldquo;you owe your situation to
me. If you have aided Jack Sheppard's escape,
you shall owe your discharge to me also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, sir,&rdquo; replied the tapstress,
coolly. &ldquo;And the next time Captain Darrell
wants a witness, I promise you he shan't look
for one in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! hussy, dare you threaten?&rdquo; cried
Wild; but, checking himself, he turned to
Ireton and asked, &ldquo;How long have the women
been gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely five minutes,&rdquo; replied the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of you fly to the market,&rdquo; returned
Jonathan; &ldquo;another to the river; a third to
the New Mint. Disperse in every direction.
We'll have him yet. A hundred pounds to
the man who takes him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he rushed out, followed by Ireton
and Langley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Shotbolt.
&ldquo;That's a glorious reward. Do you think
he'll pay it?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="292">
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure of it,&rdquo; replied Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I'll have it before to&hyphen;morrow morning,&rdquo; 
said the keeper of the New Prison, to
himself. &ldquo;If Jack Sheppard sups with Mr.
Kneebone, I'll make one of the party.&rdquo;</p></div4></div3>

<p><smallcap>About</smallcap> an hour after the occurrences at Newgate,
the door of the small back&hyphen;parlour already
described at Dollis Hill was opened by
Winifred, who, gliding noiselessly across the
room, approached a couch, on which was extended
a sleeping female, and, gazing anxiously
at her pale careworn countenance, murmured,
&mdash;&ldquo;Heaven be praised! she still slumbers&mdash; 
slumbers peacefully. The opiate has done its
duty. Poor thing! how beautiful she looks!
but how like death!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Deathlike, indeed, was the repose of the
sleeper,&mdash;deathlike and deep. Its very calmness
was frightful. Her lips were apart, but
no breath seemed to issue from them; and, but
for a slight&mdash;very slight palpitation of the</pp>
<pb n="2">
<pp>bosom, the vital principle might be supposed
to be extinct. This lifeless appearance was
heightened by the extreme sharpness of her
features&mdash;especially the nose and chin,&mdash;and
by the emaciation of her limbs, which was
painfully distinct through her drapery. Her
attenuated arms were crossed upon her breast; 
and her black brows and eye&hyphen;lashes contrasted
fearfully with the livid whiteness of her skin.
A few short, dark locks, escaping from beneath
her head&hyphen;dress, showed that her hair had
been removed, and had only been recently allowed
to grow again.</pp></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Poor Mrs. Sheppard!&rdquo; sighed Winifred,
as she contemplated the beautiful wreck before
her,&mdash;&ldquo;Poor Mrs. Sheppard! when I see her
thus, and think of all she had endured, of all
she may yet have to endure, I could almost
pray for her release from trouble. I dare not
reflect upon the effect that her son's fate,&mdash;if
the efforts to save him are ineffectual,&mdash;may
have upon her enfeebled frame, and still worse
upon her mind. What a mercy that the blow</pp>
<pb n="3">
<pp>aimed at her by the ruffian, Wild, though it
brought her to the brink of the grave, should
have restored her to reason! Ah! she stirs.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>As she said this, she drew a little aside,
while Mrs. Sheppard heaved a deep sigh, and
opened her eyes, which now looked larger,
blacker, and more melancholy than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; she cried, passing her hand
across her brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your friends, dear Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; 
replied Winifred, advancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you are there, my dear young lady,&rdquo; 
said the widow, smiling faintly; &ldquo;when I first
waken, I'm always in dread of finding myself
again in that horrible asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need never be afraid of that,&rdquo; returned
Winifred, affectionately; &ldquo;my father
will take care you never leave him more.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Oh! how much I owe him!&rdquo; said the
widow, with fervour, &ldquo;for bringing me here,
and removing me from those dreadful sights
and sounds, that would have driven me distracted,
even if I had been in my right mind.</pp>
<pb n="4">
<pp>And how much I owe <it>you</it>, too, dearest Winifred,
for your kindness and attention. Without
you I should never have recovered either
health or reason. I can never be grateful
enough. But, though <it>I</it> cannot reward you,
Heaven will.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't say anything about it, dear Mrs.
Sheppard,&rdquo; rejoined Winifred, controlling her
emotion, and speaking as cheerfully as she
could; &ldquo;I would do anything in the world
for you, and so would my father, and so would
Thames; but he <it>ought</it>, for he's your nephew,
you know. We all love you dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you! bless you!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard,
averting her face to hide her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mustn't tell you what Thames means to
do for you if ever he gains his rights,&rdquo; continued
Winifred; &ldquo;but I <it>may</it> tell you what
my father means to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has done too much already,&rdquo; answered
the widow. &ldquo;I shall need little more.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;But, <it>do</it> hear what it is,&rdquo; rejoined Winifred; 
&ldquo;you know I'm shortly to be united to</pp>
<pb n="5">
<pp>your nephew,&mdash;that is,&rdquo; she added, blushing,
&ldquo;when he can be married by his right name,
for my father won't consent to it before.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father will never oppose your happiness,
my dear, I'm sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard; 
&ldquo;but, what has this to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall hear,&rdquo; replied Winifred; &ldquo;when
this marriage takes place, you and I shall be
closely allied, but my father wishes for a still
closer alliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be plain, then,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;he
has asked me whether I have any objection to
you as a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&mdash;what was your answer?&rdquo; demanded
the widow, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't you guess?&rdquo; returned Winifred,
throwing her arms about her neck. &ldquo;That he
couldn't choose any one so agreeable to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Winifred,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard, after a
brief pause, during which she appeared overcome
by her feelings,&mdash;&ldquo;Winifred,&rdquo; she said,
gently disengaging herself from the young</pp>
<pb n="6">
<pp>girl's embrace, and speaking in a firm voice,
&ldquo;you must dissuade your father from this
step.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;Can you
not love him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love him!&rdquo; echoed the widow. &ldquo;The
feeling is dead within my breast. My only
love is for my poor lost son. I can esteem
him, regard him; but, love him as he <it>ought</it>
to be loved&mdash;that I cannot do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your esteem is all he will require,&rdquo; urged
Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has it, and will ever have it,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Sheppard, passionately,&mdash;&ldquo;he has my
boundless gratitude and devotion. But I am
not worthy to be any man's wife&mdash;far less
<it>his</it> wife. Winifred, you are deceived in me.
You know not what a wretched guilty thing
I am. You know not in what dark places
my life has been cast; with what crimes it
has been stained. But the offences I <it>have</it>
committed are venial in comparison with what
I should commit were I to wed your father.
No&mdash;no, it must never be.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="7">
<p>&ldquo;You paint yourself worse than you are,
dear Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; rejoined Winifred kindly.
&ldquo;Your faults were the faults of circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palliate them as you may,&rdquo; replied the
widow, gravely, &ldquo;they <it>were</it> faults; and as
such, cannot be repaired by a greater wrong.
If you love me, do not allude to this subject
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry I mentioned it at all, since it
distresses you,&rdquo; returned Winifred; &ldquo;but, as
I knew my father intended to propose to you,
if poor Jack should be respited&wblank;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>If</it> he should be respited!&rdquo; repeated Mrs.
Sheppard, with startling eagerness. &ldquo;Does
your father doubt it? Speak! tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winifred made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hesitation convinces me he does,&rdquo; 
replied the widow. &ldquo;Is Thames returned from
London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but I expect
him every minute. My father's chief fear,
I must tell you, is from the baneful influence
of Jonathan Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That fiend is ever in my path,&rdquo; exclaimed</pp>
<pb n="8">
<pp>Mrs. Sheppard, with a look, the wildness of
which greatly alarmed her companion. &ldquo;I
cannot scare him thence.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Winifred, &ldquo;Thames is arrived.
I hear the sound of his horse's feet in
the yard. Now you will learn the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven support me!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard,
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breathe at this phial,&rdquo; said Winifred.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards,&mdash;it seemed an age to the
anxious mother,&mdash;Mr. Wood entered the room,
followed by Thames. The latter looked very
pale, either from the effect of his wound, which
was not yet entirely healed, or from suppressed
emotion,&mdash;partly, perhaps, from both causes,&mdash; 
and wore his left arm in a sling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard, raising herself,
and looking at him as if her life depended
upon the answer. &ldquo;He is respited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo; replied Thames, sadly. &ldquo;The
warrant for his execution is arrived. There is
no further hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor son!&rdquo; groaned the widow, sinking
backwards.</p>
<pb n="9">
<p>&ldquo;Heaven have mercy on his soul!&rdquo; ejaculated
Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Jack!&rdquo; cried Winifred, burying her
face in her lover's bosom.</p>
<p>Not a word was uttered for some time, nor
any sound heard except the stifled sobs of the
unfortunate mother.</p>
<p>At length, she suddenly started to her feet; 
and, before Winifred could prevent her, staggered
up to Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is he to suffer?&rdquo; she demanded, fixing
her large black eyes, which burnt with an
insane gleam, upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Friday,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Sheppard; &ldquo;and
to&hyphen;day is Monday. He has three days to live.
Only three days. Three short days. Horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul! her senses are going again,&rdquo; 
said Mr. Wood, terrified by the wildness of
her looks. &ldquo;I was afraid it would be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Only three days,&rdquo; reiterated the widow,
&ldquo;three short, short days,&mdash;and then all is over.
Jonathan's wicked threat is fulfilled at last. The</pp>
<pb n="10">
<pp>gallows is in view&mdash;I see it with all its hideous
apparatus!&mdash;ough!&rdquo; and shuddering violently,
she placed her hands before her, as if to exclude
some frightful vision from her sight.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not despair, my sweet soul,&rdquo; said Wood,
in a soothing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not despair!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Sheppard,
with a laugh that cut the ears of those who
listened to it like a razor,&mdash;&ldquo;Do not despair!
And who or what shall give me comfort when
my son is gone? I have wept till my eyes are
dry,&mdash;suffered till my heart is broken,&mdash;prayed
till the voice of prayer is dumb,&mdash;and all of
no avail. He will be hanged&mdash;hanged&mdash;hanged.
Ha! ha! What have I left but despair and
madness? Promise me one thing, Mr. Wood,&rdquo; 
she continued, with a sudden change of tone,
and convulsively clutching the carpenter's arm,
&ldquo;promise it me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything, my dear,&rdquo; replied Wood. &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Bury us together in one grave in Willesden
churchyard. There is a small yew&hyphen;tree
west of the church. Beneath that tree let us</pp>
<pb n="11">
<pp>lie. In one grave, mind. Do you promise to
do this?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Solemnly,&rdquo; rejoined the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said the widow, gratefully. &ldquo;I
must see him to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible, dear Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; said
Thames. &ldquo;To&hyphen;morrow I will take you to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To&hyphen;morrow will be too late,&rdquo; replied the
widow, in a hollow voice, &ldquo;I feel it will. I
must go to&hyphen;night, or I shall never behold
him again. I must bless him before I die.
I have strength enough to drag myself there,
and I do not want to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be pacified, sweet soul,&rdquo; said Wood, looking
meaningly at Thames; &ldquo;you <it>shall</it> go, and
I will accompany you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mother's blessing on you,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Sheppard, fervently. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she added,
with somewhat more composure, &ldquo;leave me,
dear friends, I entreat, for a few minutes to
collect my scattered thoughts&mdash;to prepare
myself for what I have to go through&mdash;to
pray for my son.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="12">
<p>&ldquo;Shall we do so?&rdquo; whispered Winifred to
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; returned Wood; &ldquo;don't
delay an instant.&rdquo; And, followed by the young
couple, who gazed wistfully at the poor sufferer,
he hastily quitted the room, and locked
the door after him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheppard was no sooner alone than she
fell upon her knees by the side of the couch,
and poured forth her heart in prayer. So
absorbed was she by her passionate supplications,
that she was insensible to anything passing
around her, until she felt a touch upon her
shoulder, and heard a well&hyphen;known voice breathe
in her ear&mdash;&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started at the sound as if an apparition
had called her, screamed, and fell into her son's
outstretched arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! dear mother!&rdquo; cried Jack, folding
her to his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! my dear, dear son!&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Sheppard, returning his embrace with all
a parent's tenderness.</p>
<p><pp>Jack was completely overcome. His chest</pp>
<pb n="13">
<pp>heaved violently, and big tears coursed rapidly
down his cheeks.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't deserve it,&rdquo; he said, at length; 
&ldquo;but I would have risked a thousand deaths
to enjoy this moment's happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you must have risked much to obtain
it, my love. I have scarcely recovered from
the shock of hearing of your condemnation,
when I behold you free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not two hours since,&rdquo; rejoined Jack, &ldquo;I
was chained down in the Condemned Hold
in Newgate. With a small saw, conveyed
to me a few days since by Thames Darrell,
which I contrived to conceal upon my person,
I removed a spike in the hatch, and, with the
aid of some other friends, worked my way out.
Having heard from Thames that you were
better, and that your sole anxiety was about
me, I came to give you the <it>first</it> intelligence
of my escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you for it. But you will stay
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not. I must provide for my
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="14">
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wood will protect you,&rdquo; urged Mrs.
Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not the power&mdash;perhaps not the
will to do so. And if he would, <it>I</it> would not
subject him to the annoyance. The moment
my escape is known, a large reward will be
placed on my head. My dress, my person
will be minutely described. Jonathan Wild
and his blood&hyphen;hounds, with a hundred others,
incited by the reward, will be upon my track.
Nay, for aught I know, some of them may
even now have got scent of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You terrify me,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard.
&ldquo;Oh! if this is the case, do not stay an
instant. Fly! fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can do so with safety, I will
return, or send to you,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not endanger yourself on my account,&rdquo; 
rejoined his mother. &ldquo;I am quite easy now; 
receive my blessing, my dear son; and if we
never meet again, rest assured my last prayer
shall be for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Do not talk thus, dear mother,&rdquo; returned
Jack, gazing anxiously at her pale countenance,</pp>
<pb n="15">
<pp>&ldquo;or I shall not be able to quit you.
You must live for me.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to do so,&rdquo; replied the widow; 
forcing a smile. &ldquo;One last embrace. I need
not counsel you to avoid those fatal courses
which have placed you in such fearful jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not,&rdquo; replied Jack, in a tone
of the deepest compunction. &ldquo;And, oh! forgive
me, though I can never forgive myself,
for the misery I have caused you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive you!&rdquo; echoed his mother, with a
look radiant with delight. &ldquo;I have nothing
to forgive. Ah!&rdquo; she screamed, with a sudden
change of manner; and pointing to the
window, which Jack had left open, and at
which a dark figure was standing, &ldquo;there is
Jonathan Wild!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betrayed!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, glancing in
the same direction. &ldquo;The door!&mdash;the door!
&mdash;death!&rdquo; he added, as he tried the handle,
&ldquo;it is locked&mdash;and I am unarmed. Madman
that I am to be so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<pb n="16">
<p>&ldquo;Be silent,&rdquo; said Jonathan, striding deliberately
into the room; &ldquo;these cries will
avail you nothing. Whoever answers them
must assist me to capture your son. Be silent,
I say, if you value his safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Awed by Jonathan's manner, Mrs. Sheppard
repressed the scream that rose to her lips, and
both mother and son gazed with apprehension
at the heavy figure of the thieftaker, which,
viewed in the twilight, seemed dilated to twice
its natural size, and appeared almost to block
up the window. In addition to his customary
arms, Jonathan carried a bludgeon with a
large heavy knob, suspended from his wrist
by a loop; a favourite weapon, which he always
took with him on dangerous expeditions,
and which, if any information had been requisite,
would have told Sheppard that the
present was one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jack,&rdquo; he said, after a pause,
&ldquo;are you disposed to go back quietly with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll ascertain that when you attempt
to touch me,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard, resolutely.</p>
<pb n="17">
<p>&ldquo;My janizaries are within call,&rdquo; returned
Wild. &ldquo;I'm armed; you are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters not. You shall not take me
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare him! spare him!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard,
falling on her knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, mother,&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;do not
kneel to him. I wouldn't accept my life from
him. I've foiled him hitherto, and will foil
him yet. And, come what will, I'll balk him
of the satisfaction of hanging me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan raised his bludgeon, but controlled
himself by a powerful effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;do you think I wouldn't
have secured you before this if I hadn't some
motive for my forbearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that motive is fear,&rdquo; replied Jack contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear!&rdquo; echoed Wild, in a terrible tone,&mdash; 
&ldquo;fear! Repeat that word again, and nothing
shall save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't anger him, my dear son,&rdquo; implored
the poor widow, with a look of anguish at
Jack. &ldquo;Perhaps he means well.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="18">
<p>&ldquo;Mad as you are, you're the more sensible
of the two, I must say,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare him!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard, who
fancied she had made some impression on the
obdurate breast of the thieftaker,&mdash;&ldquo;spare
him! and I will forgive you, will thank you,
will bless you. Spare him! spare him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one condition I <it>will</it> spare him,&rdquo; returned
Wild; &ldquo;on one condition only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the poor woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either he or you must return with me,&rdquo; 
answered Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take <it>me</it>, then,&rdquo; replied the widow. And
she would have rushed to him, if she had not
been forcibly withheld by her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go near him, mother,&rdquo; cried Jack; 
&ldquo;do not believe him. There is some deep
treachery hidden beneath his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>will</it> go,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard, struggling
to get free.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Attend to me, Mrs. Sheppard,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
looking calmly on at this distressing
scene. &ldquo;Attend to me, and do not heed him.
I swear to you, solemnly swear to you, I will</pp>
<pb n="19">
<pp>save your son's life, nay more, will befriend
him, will place him out of the reach of his
enemies, if you consent to become my wife.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Execrable villain!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard; &ldquo;he
swears to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied her son; &ldquo;and you spurn
the proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she accepts it,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan,
triumphantly. &ldquo;Come along, Mrs. Sheppard.
I've a carriage within call shall convey you
swiftly to town. Come! come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, mother,&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;and I
will explain to you <it>why</it> the villain makes this
strange and revolting proposal. He well knows
that but two lives&mdash;those of Thames Darrell
and Sir Rowland Trenchard,&mdash;stand between
you and the vast possessions of the family.
Those lives removed,&mdash;and Sir Rowland is
completely in his power, the estates would be
yours&mdash;<smallcap>His</smallcap>! if he were your husband. Now
do you see his motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing but your danger,&rdquo; replied
his mother, tenderly.</p>
<pb n="20">
<p>&ldquo;Granted it were as you say, Jack,&rdquo; said
Wild;&mdash;&ldquo;and I sha'n't take the trouble to
contradict you&mdash;the estates would be <it>yours</it>
hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Do you affect ignorance
that I am a condemned felon, and can
inherit nothing? But do not imagine that
under any circumstances I would accept your
terms. My mother shall never degrade herself
by a connection with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Degrade herself,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan, brutally.
&ldquo;Do you think I would take a harlot
to my bed, if it didn't suit my purposes to
do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says right,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard,
distractedly. &ldquo;I am only fit for such as him.
Take me! take me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before an hour you shall be mine,&rdquo; said
Jonathan advancing towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; cried Jack fiercely: &ldquo;lay a finger
on her, and I will fell you to the ground.
Mother! do you know what you do? Would
you sell yourself to this fiend?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I would sell myself, body and soul, to</pp>
<pb n="21">
<pp>save you,&rdquo; rejoined his mother, bursting from
his grasp.</pp></p>
<p>Jonathan caught her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come away!&rdquo; he cried, with the roar of a
demon.</p>
<p>This laugh and his looks alarmed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <it>is</it> the fiend!&rdquo; she exclaimed, recoiling.
&ldquo;Save me!&mdash;save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; vociferated Jonathan, savagely.
&ldquo;We've no time for any Bedlam scenes
now. Come along, you mad jade. I'll teach
you submission in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, he endeavoured to force her off; 
but, before he could accomplish his purpose,
he was arrested, and his throat seized by Jack.
In the struggle, Mrs. Sheppard broke from
him, and filled the room with her shrieks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll now pay the debt I owe you,&rdquo; cried
Jack, tightening his gripe till the thieftaker
blackened in the face.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; cried Wild, freeing himself by a
powerful effort, and dealing Jack a violent
blow with the heavy bludgeon, which knocked
him backwards, &ldquo;you are not yet a match for</pp>
<pb n="22">
<pp>Jonathan Wild. Neither you nor your mother
shall escape me. But I must summon my
janizaries.&rdquo; So saying, he raised a whistle to
his lips, and blew a loud call; and, as this
was unanswered, another still louder. &ldquo;Confusion!&rdquo; 
he cried; &ldquo;something has happened.
But I won't be cheated of my prize.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Sheppard,
fleeing from him to the farthest corner of the
room.</p>
<p>But it was of no avail. Jonathan again
seized her, when the door was thrown open,
and Thames Darrell, followed by Mr. Wood
and several serving&hyphen;men, all well armed, rushed
into the room. A glance sufficed to show the
young man how matters stood. He flew to
the window, and would have passed his sword
through the thieftaker's body, if the latter had
not quickly interposed the person of Mrs.
Sheppard, so that if the blow had been stricken
she must have received it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quilt!&mdash;Mendez!&mdash;Where are you?&rdquo; 
vociferated Wild, sounding his whistle for the
third time.</p>
<pb n="23">
<p>&ldquo;You call in vain,&rdquo; rejoined Thames.
&ldquo;Your assistants are in my power. Yield,
villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put down your burthen, monster!&rdquo; shouted
Wood, pointing an immense blunderbuss at
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her,&rdquo; cried Jonathan; and, flinging
the now inanimate body of the poor widow,
who had fainted in the struggle, into the arms
of Thames, he leapt through the window, and
by the time the latter could consign her to
Wood, and dart after him, he had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pursue him,&rdquo; cried Thames to the attendants,
&ldquo;and see that he does not escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order was promptly obeyed.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; continued Thames, addressing
Sheppard, who had only just recovered from
the blow, and regained his feet, &ldquo;I don't ask
<it>how</it> you came here, nor do I blame your rashness
in doing so. Fortunately, ever since
Wild's late murderous attack, the household
has all been well armed. A postchaise seen in</pp>
<pb n="24">
<pp>the road first alarmed us. On searching the
grounds, we found two suspicious&hyphen;looking fellows
in the garden, and had scarcely secured
them, when your mother's cries summoned us
hither, just in time to preserve her.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your arrival was most providential,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not remain here another instant,&rdquo; 
replied Thames. &ldquo;My horse is at the
door, saddled, with pistols in the holsters,&mdash; 
mount him and fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thames, I have much to say,&rdquo; said Jack,
&ldquo;much that concerns your safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; returned Thames, impatiently.
&ldquo;I cannot&mdash;will not suffer you to remain
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go, if you will consent to meet me
at midnight near the old house in Wych
Street,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;By that time, I shall
have fully considered a plan which occurs to
me for defeating the schemes of your enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before that time you will be captured, if
you expose yourself thus,&rdquo; rejoined Thames.
&ldquo;However, I will be there. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="25">
<p>&ldquo;Till midnight,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>And imprinting a kiss upon his mother's
cold lips, he left the room. He found the
horse where Thames told him he would find
him, mounted, and rode off across the fields in
the direction of town.</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>Jonathan Wild's</smallcap> first object, as soon as he
had made good his retreat, was to ascertain
what had become of his janizaries, and, if possible,
to release them. With this view, he
hurried to the spot where he had left the postchaise,
and found it drawn up at the road&hyphen;side,
the postilion dismounted, and in charge of a
couple of farming&hyphen;men. Advancing towards
them, sword in hand, Jonathan so terrified the
hinds by his fierce looks and determined manner,
that, after a slight show of resistance, they
took to their heels, leaving him master of the
field. He then threw open the door of the
vehicle, in which he found his janizaries with
their arms pinioned, and, leaping into it,
ordered the man to drive off. The postilion</pp>
<pb n="27">
<pp>obeyed, and dashed off as hard as his horses
could gallop along the beautiful road leading
to Neasdon and Willesden, just as the servingmen
made their appearance. Arrived at the
latter place, Jonathan, who, meanwhile, had
contrived to liberate his attendants from their
bonds, drew up at the Six Bells, and hiring a
couple of horses, despatched his attendants in
search of Jack Sheppard, while he proceeded
to town. Dismissing the post&hyphen;chaise at the
Old Bailey, he walked to Newgate to ascertain
what had occurred since the escape. It was
just upon the stroke of nine as he entered the
Lodge, and Mr. Austin was dismissing a host
of inquirers who had been attracted thither by
the news,&mdash;for it had already been extensively
noised abroad. Some of these persons were
examining the spot where the spike had been
cut off; others the spike itself, now considered
a remarkable object; and all were marvelling
how Jack could have possibly squeezed himself
through such a narrow aperture, until it was
explained to them by Mr. Austin that the renowned
housebreaker was of slender bodily</pp>
<pb n="28">
<pp>conformation, and therefore able to achieve a
feat, which he, Mr. Austin, or any man of
similar dimensions, would have found wholly
impossible. Affixed to the wall, in a conspicuous
situation, was a large placard, which, after
minutely describing Sheppard's appearance and
attire, concluded thus:&mdash;&ldquo;<it>Whoever will discover
or apprehend the above</it> <smallcap>John Sheppard</smallcap>,
<it>so that he be brought to justice, shall receive</it>
ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS REWARD,
<it>to be paid by</it> <smallcap>Mr. Pitt</smallcap>, <it>the keeper of Newgate.</it>&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>This placard attracted universal attention.
While Jonathan was conversing with Austin,
from whom he took care to conceal the fact of
his having seen Sheppard since his escape,
Ireton entered the Lodge.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Altogether unsuccessful, sir,&rdquo; said the
chief turnkey, with a look of disappointment,
not unmixed with apprehension, as he approached
Wild. &ldquo;I've been to all the flash
cases in town, and can hear nothing of him or
his wives. First, I went to Country Tom's,
the Goat, in Long Lane. Tom swore he</pp>
<pb n="29">
<pp>hadn't set eyes on him since the trial. I next
proceeded to Jenny Bunch's, the Ship, in Trig
Lane&mdash;there I got the same answer. Then to
the Feathers, in Drury Lane. Then to the
Golden Ball, in the same street. Then to
Martin's brandy&hyphen;shop, in Fleet Street. Then
to Dan Ware's, in Hanging Sword Court.
Then to the Dean's Head, in St. Martin's Le
Grand. And, lastly, to the Seven Cities o'
Refuge, in the New Mint. And nowhere
could I obtain the slightest information.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been more successful, sir?&rdquo; 
ventured Ireton.</p>
<p>Jonathan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Shotbolt thinks he has a scheme that
can't fail,&rdquo; interposed Austin; &ldquo;but he wishes
to know whether you'll be as good as your
word, in respect to the great reward you offered
for Jack's capture.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Have I ever broken my word in such
matters, that he dares put the question?&rdquo; rejoined
Jonathan sternly. &ldquo;Tell Mr. Shotbolt
that if he, or any other person, takes Jack</pp>
<pb n="30">
<pp>Sheppard before to&hyphen;morrow morning, I'll
double it. Do you hear?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; replied Austin respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred pounds, if he's lodged in
Newgate before to&hyphen;morrow morning,&rdquo; continued
Wild. &ldquo;Make it known among your
friends.&rdquo; And he strode out of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Ireton,
&ldquo;besides the governor's offer&mdash;that's three
hundred. I must go to work again. Keep a
sharp look out, Austin, and see that we lose no
one else. I should be sorry if Shotbolt got the
reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devilish hard! I'm not allowed a chance,&rdquo; 
grumbled Austin, as he was left alone. &ldquo;However,
some one <it>must</it> look after the gaol; and
they're all gone but me. It's fortunate we've
no more Jack Sheppards, or I should stand but
a poor chance. Well, I don't think they'll
any of 'em nab him, that's one comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>On quitting the Lodge, Wild repaired to
his own habitation. Telling the porter that he
would attend to the house himself, he bade
him go in search of Jack Sheppard. There</pp>
<pb n="31">
<pp>was something in Jonathan's manner, as he
issued this command, that struck the man as
singular, and he afterwards recalled it. He,
however, made no remark at the time, but instantly
prepared to set out. As soon as he
was gone, Jonathan went up stairs to the audience&hyphen;chamber; 
and, sitting down, appeared for
some time buried in reflection. The dark and
desperate thoughts that were passing through
his mind at this time will presently be shown.
After a while, he raised his eyes; and, if their
glance could have been witnessed at the moment,
it could not have been easily forgotten.
Muttering something to himself, he appeared
to be telling upon his fingers the advantages
and disadvantages of some scheme he had in
contemplation. That he had resolved upon
its execution, whatever it might be, was evident
from his saying aloud,&mdash; 
<lb>&ldquo;I will do it. So good an opportunity may
never occur again.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>Upon this he arose, and paced the room
hastily backwards and forwards, as if further
arranging his plans. He then unlocked a</pp>
<pb n="32">
<pp>cabinet, opened a secret drawer; and, after
ransacking its contents, discovered a paper he
was in search of, and a glove. Laying these
carefully aside, he restored the drawer to its
place. His next occupation was to take out
his pistols, examine the priming, and rub the
flints. His sword then came in for his scrutiny:
he felt at, and appeared satisfied with
its edge. This employment seemed to afford
him the highest satisfaction; for a diabolical
grin&mdash;it cannot be called a smile&mdash;played
upon his face all the time he was engaged in
it. His sword done with, he took up the
bludgeon; balanced it in his hand; upon the
points of his fingers; and let it fall with a
smash, intentionally, upon the table.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is the safest
weapon. No instrument I've ever used has
done me such good service. It <it>shall</it> be the
bludgeon.&rdquo; So saying, he slung it upon his
wrist.</p>
<p><pp>Taking up a link, which was blazing beside
him, he walked across the room; and touching
a spring in the wall, a secret door flew open.</pp>
<pb n="33">
<pp>Beyond was a narrow bridge, crossing a circular
building, at the bottom of which lay a
deep well. It was a dark mysterious place,
and what it was used for no one exactly knew; 
but it was called by those who had seen it
the Well Hole. The bridge was protected
on either side by a railing with banisters
placed at wide intervals. Steps to aid the
descent, which was too steep to be safe without
them, led to a door on the opposite side.
This door, which was open, Jonathan locked
and took out the key. As he stood upon the
bridge, he held down the light, and looked
into the profound abyss. The red glare fell
upon the slimy brick&hyphen;work, and tinged the
inky waters below. A slight cough uttered by
Jonathan at the moment awakened the echoes
of the place, and was returned in hollow reverberations.
&ldquo;There 'll be a louder echo
here presently,&rdquo; thought Jonathan. Before
leaving the place he looked upwards, and
could just discern the blue vault and pale
stars of heaven through an iron grating at the
top.</pp></p>
<pb n="34">
<p>On his return to the room, Jonathan purposely
left the door of the Well Hole ajar.
Unlocking a cupboard, he then took out some
cold meat and other viands, with a flask of
wine, and a bottle of brandy, and began to eat
and drink voraciously. He had very nearly
cleared the board, when a knock was heard below,
and descending at the summons, he found
his two janizaries. They had both been unsuccessful.
As Jonathan scarcely expected a
more satisfactory result, he made no comment; 
but, ordering Quilt to continue his search, and
not to return until he had found the fugitive,
called Abraham Mendez into the house, and
shut the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you for the job I spoke of a short
time ago, Nab,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean to have no
one but yourself in it. Come up stairs, and
take a glass of brandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abraham grinned, and silently followed his
master, who, as soon as they reached the audience&hyphen;chamber,
poured out a bumper of spirits,
and presented it to him. The Jew swallowed
it at a draught.</p>
<pb n="35">
<p>&ldquo;By my shoul!&rdquo; he exclaimed, smacking
his lips, &ldquo;dat ish goot&mdash;very goot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall finish the bottle when the job's
done,&rdquo; replied Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat ish it, Mishter Vild?&rdquo; inquired Mendez.
&ldquo;Shir Rowland Trenchard's affair&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan; &ldquo;I expect
him here every minute. When you've admitted
him, steal into the room, hide yourself, and
don't move till I utter the words, &lsquo;You've a
long journey before you.&rsquo; That's your signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a famoush goot shignal it ish,&rdquo; laughed
Abraham. &ldquo;He hash a long journey before
him&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; cried Jonathan. &ldquo;There's his
knock. Go, and let him in. And mind you
don't arouse his suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear&mdash;never fear,&rdquo; rejoined Abraham,
as he took up the link, and left the
room.</p>
<p><pp>Jonathan cast a hasty glance around, to see
that all was properly arranged for his purpose; 
placed a chair with its back to the door; disposed</pp>
<pb n="36">
<pp>the lights on the table so as to throw
the entrance of the room more into shadow; 
and then flung himself into a seat to await
Sir Rowland's arrival.</pp></p>
<p>He had not to wait long. Enveloped in a
large cloak, Sir Rowland stalked into the
room, and took the seat assigned him; while
the Jew, who received a private signal from
Jonathan, set down the link near the entrance
of the well&hyphen;hole, and, having made fast the
door, crept behind one of the cases.</p>
<p>Fancying they were alone, Sir Rowland
threw aside his cloak, and produced a heavy
bag of money, which he flung upon the table; 
and, when Wild had feasted his greedy eyes
sufficiently upon its golden contents, he handed
him a pocket&hyphen;book filled with notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have behaved like a man of honour,
Sir Rowland,&rdquo; said Wild, after he had twice
told over the money. &ldquo;Right to a farthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me an acquittance,&rdquo; said Trenchard.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It's scarcely necessary,&rdquo; replied Wild; 
&ldquo;however, if you require it, certainly. There</pp>
<pb n="37">
<pp>it is. &lsquo;Received from Sir Rowland Trenchard,
&pound;15,000&mdash;Jonathan Wild: August 31st, 1724.&rsquo; 
Will that do?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; replied Trenchard. &ldquo;This is our
last transaction together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; replied Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the last,&rdquo; continued the knight,
sternly; &ldquo;and I trust we may never meet
again. I have paid you this large sum&mdash;not
because you are entitled to it, for you have
failed in what you undertook to do, but because
I desire to be troubled with you no further.
I have now settled my affairs, and made
every preparation for my departure to France,
where I shall spend the remainder of my days.
And I have made such arrangements that at
my decease tardy justice will be done my injured
nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made no such arrangements as
will compromise me, I hope, Sir Rowland?&rdquo; 
said Wild, hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I live you are safe,&rdquo; rejoined Trenchard; 
&ldquo;after my death I can answer for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="38">
<p>&ldquo;'Sblood!&rdquo; exclaimed Wild, uneasily. &ldquo;This
alters the case materially. When were you
last confessed, Sir Rowland?&rdquo; he added abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; rejoined the other
haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because I'm always distrustful
of a priest,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just parted from one,&rdquo; said Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the worse,&rdquo; replied Jonathan,
rising and taking a turn, as if uncertain what
to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Rowland.
&ldquo;He who stands on the verge of the grave, as
I do, should never be unprepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're strangely superstitious, Sir Rowland,&rdquo; 
said Jonathan, halting, and looking
steadfastly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were so, I should not be here,&rdquo; returned
Trenchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Wild, curiously.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I had a terrible dream last night. I
thought my sister and her murdered husband</pp>
<pb n="39">
<pp>dragged me hither, to this very room, and commanded
you to slay me.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;A terrible dream, indeed,&rdquo; said Jonathan
thoughtfully. &ldquo;But you mustn't indulge these
gloomy thoughts. Let me recommend a glass
of wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My penance forbids it,&rdquo; said Trenchard,
waving his hand. &ldquo;I cannot remain here
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will remain longer than you anticipate,&rdquo; 
muttered Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I go,&rdquo; continued Sir Rowland, &ldquo;I
must beg of you to disclose to me all you
know relative to the parentage of Thames Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; replied Wild. &ldquo;Thinking it
likely you might desire to have this information,
I prepared accordingly. First, look at
this glove. It belonged to his father, and was
worn by him on the night he was murdered.
You will observe that a coronet is embroidered
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Trenchard, starting, &ldquo;is
he so highly born?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="40">
<p>&ldquo;This letter will inform you,&rdquo; replied Wild,
placing a document in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; cried Sir Rowland. &ldquo;I
know the hand&mdash;ha! my friend! and I have
murdered <it>him</it>! And my sister was thus nobly,
thus illustriously wedded. O God! O God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he appeared convulsed with agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if I had known this,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;what guilt, what remorse might have been
spared me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repentance comes too late when the deed's
done,&rdquo; returned Wild, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not too late to repair the wrong I
have done my nephew,&rdquo; cried Trenchard. &ldquo;I
will set about it instantly. He shall have
the estates. I will return to Manchester at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better take some refreshment before
you start,&rdquo; rejoined Wild. &ldquo;<it>You've a
long journey before you.</it>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>As the signal was given, the Jew, who had
been some time in expectation of it, darted
swiftly and silently behind Sir Rowland, and
flung a cloth over his head, while Jonathan,</pp>
<pb n="41">
<pp>rushing upon him in front, struck him several
quick and violent blows in the face with
the bludgeon. The white cloth was instantly
dyed with crimson; but, regardless of this,
Jonathan continued his murderous assault.
The struggles of the wounded man were desperate
&mdash;so desperate, that in his agony he
overset the table, and, in the confusion, tore
off the cloth, and disclosed a face horribly mutilated,
and streaming with blood. So appalling
was the sight, that even the murderers&mdash; 
familiar as they were with scenes of slaughter,
&mdash;looked aghast at it.</pp></p>
<p>During this dreadful pause the wretched
man felt for his sword. It had been removed
from the scabbard by the Jew. He uttered a
deep groan, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despatch him!&rdquo; roared Jonathan.</p>
<p>Having no means of defence, Sir Rowland
cleared the blood from his vision; and, turning
to see whether there was any means of
escape, he descried the open door behind him
leading to the Well Hole, and instantly darted
through it.</p>
<pb n="42">
<p>&ldquo;As I could wish!&rdquo; cried Jonathan. &ldquo;Bring
the light, Nab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jew snatched up the link, and followed
him.</p>
<p><pp>A struggle of the most terrific kind now ensued.
The wounded man had descended the
bridge, and dashed himself against the door
beyond it; but, finding it impossible to force
his way further, he turned to confront his assailants.
Jonathan aimed a blow at him, which,
if it had taken place, must have instantly terminated
the strife; but, avoiding this, he
sprang at the thieftaker, and grappled with
him. Firmly built, as it was, the bridge
creaked in such a manner with their contending
efforts, that Abraham durst not venture
beyond the door, where he stood, holding
the light, a horrified spectator of the scene.
The contest, however, though desperate, was
brief. Disengaging his right arm, Jonathan
struck his victim a tremendous blow on the
head with the bludgeon, that fractured his
skull; and, exerting all his strength, threw</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>376Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010122">
<pb n="43">
<pp>him over the rails, to which he clung with the
tenacity of despair.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare me!&rdquo; he groaned, looking upwards.
&ldquo;Spare me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan, however, instead of answering
him, searched for his knife, with the intention
of severing his wrist. But not finding it, he
had again recourse to the bludgeon, and began
beating the hand fixed on the upper rail, until,
by smashing the fingers, he forced it to relinquish
its hold. He then stamped upon the
hand on the lower banister, until that also relaxed
its gripe.</p>
<p>Sir Rowland then fell.</p>
<p>A hollow plunge, echoed and re&hyphen;echoed by
the walls, marked his descent into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the link,&rdquo; cried Jonathan.</p>
<p>Holding down the light, he perceived that
the wounded man had risen to the surface, and
was trying to clamber up the slippery sides of
the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him! shoot him! Put him out of
hish mishery,&rdquo; cried the Jew.</p>
<pb n="44">
<p>&ldquo;What's the use of wasting a shot?&rdquo; rejoined
Jonathan, savagely. &ldquo;He can't get
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After making several ineffectual attempts to
keep himself above water, Sir Rowland sunk,
and his groans, which had become gradually
fainter and fainter, were heard no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All's over,&rdquo; muttered Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall ve go back to de other room?&rdquo; asked
the Jew. &ldquo;I shall breathe more freely dere.
Oh! Chrisht! de door's shut! It musht have
schwung to during de schuffle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut!&rdquo; exclaimed Wild. &ldquo;Then we're
imprisoned. The spring can't be opened on
this side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere's de other door!&rdquo; cried Mendez, in
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only leads to the fencing crib,&rdquo; replied
Wild. &ldquo;There's no outlet that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't ve call for asshistanche?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;And who'll find us, if we do?&rdquo; rejoined
Wild, fiercely. &ldquo;But they <it>will</it> find the evidences
of slaughter in the other room,&mdash;the</pp>
<pb n="45">
<pp>table upset,&mdash;the bloody cloth,&mdash;the dead
man's sword,&mdash;the money,&mdash;and my memorandum,
which I forgot to remove. Hell's
curses! that after all my precautions I should
be thus entrapped. It's all your fault, you
shaking coward! and, but that I feel sure
you'll swing for your carelessness, I'd throw
you into the well, too.&rdquo;</pp></p></div4>

A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><smallcap>Persuaded</smallcap> that Jack Sheppard would keep
his appointment with Mr. Kneebone, and
feeling certain of capturing him if he did so,
Shotbolt, on quitting Newgate, hurried to
the New Prison to prepare for the enterprise.
After debating with himself for some time
whether he should employ an assistant, or
make the attempt alone, his love of gain overcame
his fears, and he decided upon the latter
plan. Accordingly, having armed himself with
various weapons, including a stout oaken staff
then ordinarily borne by the watch, and put a
coil of rope and a gag in his pocket, to be
ready in case of need, he set out, about ten
o'clock, on the expedition.</p>
<pb n="47">
<p>Before proceeding to Wych Street, he called
at the Lodge to see how matters were going on,
and found Mrs. Spurling and Austin at their
evening meal, with Caliban in attendance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Shotbolt,&rdquo; cried the turnkey,
&ldquo;I've good news for you. Mr. Wild has
doubled his offer, and the governor has likewise
proclaimed a reward of one hundred guineas
for Jack's apprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't say so!&rdquo; exclaimed Shotbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; rejoined Austin, pointing to
the placard. &ldquo;I ought to tell you that Mr.
Wild's reward is conditional upon Jack's being
taken before to&hyphen;morrow morning. So I fear
there's little chance of any one getting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so, eh?&rdquo; chuckled Shotbolt,
who was eagerly perusing the reward, and congratulating
himself upon his caution; &ldquo;you
think so&mdash;ha! ha! Well, don't go to bed,
that's all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded the turnkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the prisoner's arrival might disturb
you&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="48">
<p>&ldquo;I'll lay you twenty guineas you don't
take him to&hyphen;night,&rdquo; rejoined Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried Shotbolt. &ldquo;Mrs. Spurling,
you're a witness to the bet. Twenty guineas,
mind. I shan't let you off a farthing. Egad!
I shall make a good thing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never count your chickens till they're
hatched,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Spurling, drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>My</it> chickens are hatched, or, at least,
nearly so,&rdquo; replied Shotbolt, with increased
merriment. &ldquo;Get ready your heaviest irons,
Austin. I'll send you word when I catch
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'd better send <it>him</it>,&rdquo; jeered the
turnkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; rejoined Shotbolt; &ldquo;so I will.
If I don't, you shall clap me in the Condemned
Hold in his stead. Good&hyphen;b'ye, for the present
&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo; And, laughing loudly at his own
facetiousness, he quitted the Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll lay my life he's gone on a fox&hyphen;and&hyphen;goose
&hyphen;chase to Mr. Kneebone's,&rdquo; remarked
Austin, rising to fasten the door.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I shouldn't wonder,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Spurling,</pp>
<pb n="49">
<pp>as if struck by a sudden idea. And, while
the turnkey was busy with the keys, she whispered
to the black, &ldquo;Follow him, Caliban.
Take care he don't see you,&mdash;and bring me
word where he goes, and what he does.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Iss, missis,&rdquo; grinned the black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be so good as to let Caliban out, Mr.
Austin,&rdquo; continued the tapstress; &ldquo;he's only
going on an errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Austin readily complied with her request.
As he returned to the table, he put his finger
to his nose; and, though he said nothing, he
thought he had a much better chance of winning
his wager.</p>
<p>Unconscious that his movements were watched,
Shotbolt, meanwhile, hastened towards
Wych Street. On the way, he hired a chair
with a couple of stout porters, and ordered
them to follow him. Arrived within a short
distance of his destination, he came to a halt,
and pointing out a dark court nearly opposite
the woollen&hyphen;draper's abode, told the chairmen
to wait there till they were summoned.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I'm a peace&hyphen;officer,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;about to</pp>
<pb n="50">
<pp>arrest a notorious criminal. He'll be brought
out at this door, and may probably make some
resistance. But you must get him into the
chair as fast as you can, and hurry off to Newgate.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what 'll we get for the job, yer
hon'r?&rdquo; asked the foremost chairman, who,
like most of his tribe at the time, was an
Irishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five guineas. Here's a couple in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faix, then, we'll do it in style,&rdquo; cried the
fellow. &ldquo;Once in this chair, yer hon'r, and
I'll warrant he'll not get out so aisily as Jack
Sheppard did from the New Pris'n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sirrah,&rdquo; rejoined Shotbolt,
not over&hyphen;pleased by the remark, &ldquo;and
mind what I tell you. Ah! what's that?&rdquo; he
exclaimed, as some one brushed hastily past
him. &ldquo;If I hadn't just left him, I could
have sworn it was Mrs. Spurling's sooty imp,
Caliban.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Having seen the chairmen concealed in the
entry, Shotbolt proceeded to Mr. Kneebone's
habitation, the shutters of which were closed,</pp>
<pb n="51">
<pp>and knocked at the door. The summons was
instantly answered by a shop&hyphen;boy.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your master at home?&rdquo; inquired the
gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied a portly personage, arrayed
in a gorgeous yellow brocade dressing&hyphen;gown,
lined with cherry&hyphen;coloured satin, and having a
crimson velvet cap, surmounted by a gold tassel,
on his head. &ldquo;My name is Kneebone,&rdquo; 
added the portly personage, stepping forward.
&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word in private,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand aside, Tom,&rdquo; commanded Kneebone.
&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; he added, glancing suspiciously at
the applicant, &ldquo;your business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My business is to acquaint you that Jack
Sheppard has escaped, Mr. Kneebone,&rdquo; returned
Shotbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce he has! Why, it's only a
few hours since I beheld him chained down
with half a hundred weight of iron, in the
strongest ward at Newgate. It's almost incredible.
Are you sure you're not misinformed,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="52">
<p>&ldquo;I was in the Lodge at the time,&rdquo; replied
the gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, of course, you must know. Well,
it's scarcely credible. When I gave him an
invitation to supper, I little thought he'd accept
it. But, egad! I believe he <it>will.</it>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm convinced of it,&rdquo; replied Shotbolt; 
&ldquo;and it was on that very account I came
here.&rdquo; And he proceeded to unfold his scheme
to the woollen&hyphen;draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Kneebone, when the
other concluded, &ldquo;I shall certainly not oppose
his capture, but, at the same time, I'll
lend you no assistance. If he keeps <it>his</it> word,
I'll keep <it>mine</it>. You must wait till supper's
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, sir,&mdash;provided you don't let
him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I'll engage not to do. I've another
reason for supposing he'll pay me a visit.
I refused to sign a petition in his behalf to
the Recorder; not from any ill&hyphen;will to him, but
because it was prepared by a person whom I
particularly dislike&mdash;Captain Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="53">
<p>&ldquo;A very sufficient reason,&rdquo; answered the
gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; continued Kneebone, calling to
the shop&hyphen;boy, &ldquo;don't go home. I may want
you. Light the lantern. And, if you hear any
odd noise in the parlour, don't mind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, sir,&rdquo; replied Tom, in a
drowsy tone, and with a look seeming to imply
that he was too much accustomed to odd noises
at night to heed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, step this way, Mr. What's&hyphen;your&hyphen;name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shotbolt, sir,&rdquo; replied the gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Slipshod; follow me.&rdquo; 
And he led the way to an inner room, in the
middle of which stood a table, covered with a
large white cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Sheppard knows this house, I believe,
sir,&rdquo; observed Shotbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every inch of it,&rdquo; replied the woollen&hyphen;draper.
&ldquo;He <it>ought</it> to do, seeing that he
served his apprenticeship in it to Mr. Wood,
by whom it was formerly occupied. His name
is carved upon a beam up stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="54">
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Shotbolt. &ldquo;Where can I
hide myself?&rdquo; he added, glancing round the
room in search of a closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the table. The cloth nearly touches
the floor. Give me your staff. It'll be in your
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he brings Blueskin, or some other
ruffian with him,&rdquo; hesitated the gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he does. In that case I'll help
you. We shall be equally matched. You're
not afraid, Mr. Shoplatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; replied Shotbolt, creeping
beneath the table; &ldquo;there's my staff. Am
I quite hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite;&mdash;keep your feet in. Mind you
don't stir till supper's over. I'll stamp twice
when we've done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to mention there's a trifling reward
for his capture,&rdquo; cried Shotbolt, popping
his head from under the cloth. &ldquo;If we take
him, I don't mind giving you a share&mdash;say a
fourth&mdash;provided you lend a helping hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Curse your reward!&rdquo; exclaimed Kneebone,
angrily. &ldquo;Do you take me for a thief&hyphen;catcher,</pp>
<pb n="55">
<pp>like Jonathan Wild, that you dare to
affront me by such a proposal?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the gaoler, humbly.
&ldquo;I didn't imagine for a moment that
you'd accept it, but I thought it right to
make you the offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent, and conceal yourself. I'm about
to ring for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woollen&hyphen;draper's application to the bell
was answered by a very pretty young woman,
with dark Jewish features, roguish black eyes,
sleek glossy hair, a trim waist, and a remarkably
neat figure: the very model, in short, of
a bachelor's housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rachel,&rdquo; said Mr. Kneebone, addressing
his comely attendant; &ldquo;put a few more plates
on the table, and bring up whatever there is
in the larder. I expect company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Company!&rdquo; echoed Rachel; &ldquo;at this time
of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Company, child,&rdquo; repeated Kneebone. &ldquo;I
shall want a bottle or two of sack, and a flask
of usquebaugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="56">
<p>&ldquo;No:&mdash;stay! you'd better not bring up
any silver forks or spoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, surely you don't think your guests
would steal them,&rdquo; observed Rachel, archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shan't have the opportunity,&rdquo; replied
Kneebone. And, by way of checking
his housekeeper's familiarity, he pointed significantly
to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; cried Rachel. &ldquo;I'll see.&rdquo; 
And before she could be prevented, she lifted
up the cloth, and disclosed Shotbolt. &ldquo;Oh,
Gemini!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;A man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, my dear,&rdquo; replied the
gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now your curiosity's satisfied, child,&rdquo; 
continued Kneebone, &ldquo;perhaps, you'll attend
to my orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Not a little perplexed by the mysterious object
she had seen, Rachel left the room, and,
shortly afterwards returned with the materials
of a tolerably good supper;&mdash;to wit, a couple
of cold fowls, a tongue, the best part of a
sirloin of beef, a jar of pickles, and two small
dishes of pastry. To these she added the wine</pp>
<pb n="57">
<pp>and spirits directed, and when all was arranged
looked inquisitively at her master.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect a very extraordinary person to
supper, Rachel,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman under the table,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;He <it>does</it> seem a very extraordinary
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; another still more extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! the famous housebreaker. I thought
he was in Newgate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's let out for a few hours,&rdquo; laughed
Kneebone; &ldquo;but he's going back again after
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! how I should like to see him.
I'm told he's so handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry I can't indulge you,&rdquo; replied her
master, a little piqued. &ldquo;I shall want nothing
more. You had better go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's no use going to bed,&rdquo; answered Rachel.
&ldquo;I shan't sleep a wink while Jack Sheppard's
in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="58">
<p>&ldquo;Keep in your own room, at all events,&rdquo; 
rejoined Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Rachel, with a toss of her
pretty head, &ldquo;very well. I'll have a peep at
him, if I die for it,&rdquo; she muttered, as she went
out.</p>
<p>Mr. Kneebone, then, sat down to await the
arrival of his expected guest. Half an hour
passed, but Jack did not make his appearance.
The woollen&hyphen;draper looked at his watch. It
was eleven o'clock. Another long interval
elapsed. The watch was again consulted. It
was now a quarter past twelve. Mr. Kneebone,
who began to feel sleepy, wound it up,
and snuffed the candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect our friend has thought better of
it, and won't come,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a little patience, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the
gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you off there, Shoplatch?&rdquo; inquired
Kneebone. &ldquo;Rather cramped, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather so, sir,&rdquo; replied the other, altering
his position. &ldquo;I shall be able to stretch my
limbs presently&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="59">
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Kneebone, &ldquo;I hear a noise
without. He's coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>The caution was scarcely uttered, when the
door opened, and Jack Sheppard presented
himself. He was wrapped in a laced roquelaure,
which he threw off on his entrance into
the room. It has been already intimated that
Jack had an excessive passion for finery; and
it might have been added, that the chief part
of his ill&hyphen;gotten gains was devoted to the embellishment
of his person. On the present
occasion, he appeared to have bestowed more
than ordinary attention on his toilette. His
apparel was sumptuous in the extreme, and
such as was only worn by persons of the
highest distinction. It consisted of a full&hyphen;dress
coat of brown flowered velvet, laced with silver; 
a waistcoat of white satin, likewise richly
embroidered; shoes with red heels, and large
diamond buckles; pearl&hyphen;coloured silk stockings
with gold clocks; a muslin cravat, or steenkirk,
as it was termed, edged with the fine
point lace; ruffles of the same material, and
so ample as almost to hide the tips of his fingers;</pp>
<pb n="60">
<pp>and a silver&hyphen;hilted sword. This costume,
though somewhat extravagant, displayed
his slight, but perfectly&hyphen;proportioned figure to
the greatest advantage. The only departure
which he made from the fashion of the period,
was in respect to the peruke&mdash;an article he
could never be induced to wear. In lieu of
it, he still adhered to the sleek black crop,
which, throughout life, formed a distinguishing
feature in his appearance. Ever since the
discovery of his relationship to the Trenchard
family, a marked change had taken place in
Jack's demeanour and looks, which were so
much refined and improved that he could
scarcely be recognised as the same person.
Having only seen him in the gloom of a dungeon,
and loaded with fetters, Kneebone had
not noticed this alteration: but he was now
greatly struck by it. Advancing towards him,
he made him a formal salutation, which was
coldly returned.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am expected, I find,&rdquo; observed Jack,
glancing at the well covered board.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; replied Kneebone. &ldquo;When I</pp>
<pb n="61">
<pp>heard of your escape, I felt sure I should see
you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You judged rightly,&rdquo; rejoined Jack; &ldquo;I
never yet broke an engagement with friend or
foe&mdash;and never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bold resolution,&rdquo; said the woollendraper.
&ldquo;You must have made some exertion
to keep your present appointment. Few
men could have done as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Jack, carelessly. &ldquo;I
would have done more, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, take a chair,&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone.
&ldquo;I've waited supper, you perceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, let me introduce my friends,&rdquo; returned
Jack, stepping to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; echoed Kneebone, with a look
of dismay. &ldquo;My invitation did not extend to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Further remonstrance, however, was cut
short by the sudden entrance of Mrs. Maggot
and Edgeworth Bess. Behind them stalked
Blueskin, enveloped in a rough great&hyphen;coat,
called&mdash;appropriately enough in this instance,
&mdash;a wrap&hyphen;rascal. Folding his arms, he placed</pp>
<pb n="62">
<pp>his back against the door, and burst into a
loud laugh. The ladies were, as usual, very
gaily dressed; and as usual, also, had resorted
to art to heighten their attractions:&mdash; 
<lb><lg><l>From patches, justly placed, they borrow'd graces,</l>
<l>And with vermilion lacquer'd o'er their faces.</l></lg>
<lb>Edgeworth Bess wore a scarlet tabby neglig&eacute;e,
&mdash;a sort of undress, or sack, then much in
vogue,&mdash;which suited her to admiration, and
upon her head had what was called a fly&hyphen;cap,
with richly&hyphen;laced lappets. Mrs. Maggot was
equipped in a light blue riding&hyphen;habit, trimmed
with silver, a hunting&hyphen;cap and a flaxen peruke,
and, instead of a whip, carried a stout cudgel.</pp></p>
<p><pp>For a moment, Kneebone had hesitated about
giving the signal to Shotbolt, but, thinking a
more favourable opportunity might occur, he
determined not to hazard matters by undue
precipitation. Placing chairs, therefore, he invited
the ladies to be seated, and, paying a
similar attention to Jack, began to help to the
various dishes, and otherwise fulfil the duties
of a host. While this was going on, Blueskin,
seeing no notice whatever taken of him, coughed</pp>
<pb n="63">
<pp>loudly and repeatedly. But finding his
hints totally disregarded, he, at length, swaggered
up to the table, and thrust in a chair.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, plunging his fork
into a fowl, and transferring it to his plate.
&ldquo;This tongue looks remarkably nice,&rdquo; he added,
slicing off an immense wedge, &ldquo;excuse
me&mdash;ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make yourself at home, I perceive,&rdquo; 
observed Kneebone, with a look of ineffable
disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I generally do,&rdquo; replied Blueskin, pouring
out a bumper of sack. &ldquo;Your health, Kneebone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to offer you a glass of usquebaugh,
my dear,&rdquo; said Kneebone, turning from
him, and regarding Edgeworth Bess with a
stare so impertinent, that even that not overdelicate
young lady summoned up a blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, sir,&rdquo; replied Edgeworth
Bess. &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; she added, as she pledged
the amorous woollen&hyphen;draper, &ldquo;what a beautiful
ring that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; replied Kneebone,</pp>
<pb n="64">
<pp>taking it off, and placing it on her finger,
which he took the opportunity of kissing at
the same time; &ldquo;wear it for my sake.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; simpered Edgeworth Bess,
endeavouring to hide her confusion by looking
steadfastly at her plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't eat,&rdquo; continued Kneebone, addressing
Jack, who had remained for some time
thoughtful, and pre&hyphen;occupied with his head
upon his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain has seldom much appetite,&rdquo; 
replied Blueskin, who, having disposed of the
fowl, was commencing a vigorous attack upon
the sirloin. &ldquo;I eat for both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; observed the woollen&hyphen;draper,
&ldquo;and for every one else, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Kneebone,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin, as
he washed down an immense mouthful with
another bumper, &ldquo;do you recollect how nearly
Mr. Wild and I were nabbing you in this
very room, some nine years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Kneebone; &ldquo;and now,&rdquo; he
added, aside, &ldquo;the case is altered. I'm nearly
nabbing <it>you.</it>&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="65">
<p>&ldquo;A good deal has occurred since then, eh,
captain?&rdquo; said Blueskin, nudging Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much that I would willingly forget. Nothing
that I desire to remember,&rdquo; replied Sheppard,
sternly. &ldquo;On that night,&mdash;in this room,
&mdash;in your presence, Blueskin,&mdash;in yours Mr.
Kneebone, Mrs. Wood struck me a blow which
made me a robber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has paid dearly for it,&rdquo; muttered
Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard. &ldquo;But I
wish her hand had been as deadly as yours.
On that night,&mdash;that fatal night,&mdash;Winifred
crushed all the hopes that were rising in my
heart. On that night, I surrendered myself to
Jonathan Wild, and became&mdash;what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that night, you first met me, love,&rdquo; 
said Edgeworth Bess, endeavouring to take
his hand, which he coldly withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me,&rdquo; added Mrs. Maggot tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I had never seen either of you!&rdquo; 
cried Jack, rising and pacing the apartment
with a hurried step.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, I'm sure Winifred could never</pp>
<pb n="66">
<pp>have loved you as well as I do,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Maggot.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>You</it>!&rdquo; cried Jack, scornfully. &ldquo;Do you
compare <it>your</it> love&mdash;a love which all may purchase
&mdash;with <it>hers</it>? No one has ever loved
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except me, dear,&rdquo; insinuated Edgeworth
Bess. &ldquo;I've been always true to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; retorted Jack, with increased
bitterness. &ldquo;I'm your dupe no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil's in the wind now, captain?&rdquo; 
cried Blueskin, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; replied Jack, with forced
calmness. &ldquo;Within the last few minutes, all
my guilty life has passed before me. Nine
years ago, I was honest&mdash;was happy. Nine
years ago, I worked in this very house&mdash;had
a kind indulgent master, whom I robbed&mdash; 
twice robbed, at your instigation, villain; a
mistress, whom you have murdered; a companion,
whose friendship I have for ever forfeited; 
a mother, whose heart I have wellnigh
broken. In this room was my ruin
begun: in this room it should be ended.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="67">
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, don't take on thus, captain,&rdquo; 
cried Blueskin, rising and walking towards
him. &ldquo;If any one's to blame, it's me. I'm
ready to bear it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make me, honest?&rdquo; cried Jack.
&ldquo;Can you make me other than a condemned
felon? Can you make me not Jack Sheppard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Blueskin; &ldquo;and I wouldn't
if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; cried Jack, furiously,&mdash; 
&ldquo;curse you!&mdash;curse you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear away, captain,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin,
coolly. &ldquo;It'll ease your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mock me?&rdquo; cried Jack, levelling a
pistol at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Blueskin. &ldquo;Take my
life, if you're so disposed. You're welcome
to it. And let's see if either of these women,
who prate of their love for you, will do as
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is folly,&rdquo; cried Jack, controlling himself
by a powerful effort.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;The worst of folly,&rdquo; replied Blueskin,</pp>
<pb n="68">
<pp>returning to the table, and taking up a glass; 
&ldquo;and, to put an end to it, I shall drink the
health of Jack Sheppard, the housebreaker,
and success to him in all his enterprises.
And now, let's see who'll refuse the
pledge.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>I</it> will,&rdquo; replied Sheppard, dashing the
glass from his hand. &ldquo;Sit down, fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Kneebone, who had been considerably
interested by the foregoing scene,
&ldquo;are these regrets for your past life sincere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose them so,&rdquo; rejoined Jack, &ldquo;what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; stammered Kneebone,
his prudence getting the better of his
sympathy. &ldquo;I'm glad to hear it, that's
all,&rdquo; he added, taking out his snuff&hyphen;box, his
never&hyphen;failing resource in such emergencies.
&ldquo;It won't do to betray the officer,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh lud! what an exquisite box!&rdquo; cried
Edgeworth Bess. &ldquo;Is it gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Pure gold,&rdquo; replied Kneebone. &ldquo;It was</pp>
<pb n="69">
<pp>given me by poor dear Mrs. Wood, whose loss
I shall ever deplore.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, let me have a pinch?&rdquo; said Edgeworth
Bess, with a captivating glance. &ldquo;I am
so excessively fond of snuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woollen&hyphen;draper replied by gallantly
handing her the box, which was instantly
snatched from her by Blueskin, who, after
helping himself to as much of its contents as
he could conveniently squeeze between his
thumb and finger, put it very coolly in his
pocket.</p>
<p>The action did not pass unnoticed by Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Restore it,&rdquo; he cried, in an authoritative
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O'ons! captain,&rdquo; cried Blueskin, as he
grumblingly obeyed the command; &ldquo;if you've
left off business yourself, you needn't interfere
with other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like a little of that plum&hyphen;tart,&rdquo; 
said Mrs. Maggot; &ldquo;but I don't see a
spoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I'll ring for one,&rdquo; replied Kneebone, rising</pp>
<pb n="70">
<pp>accordingly; &ldquo;but I fear my servants are gone
to bed.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Blueskin, meanwhile, having drained and
replenished his glass, commenced chaunting a
snatch of a ballad:&mdash; 
<lb><lg><l>Once on a time, as I've heard tell,</l>
<l>In Wych Street Owen Wood did dwell;</l>
<l>A carpenter he was by trade,</l>
<l>And money, I believe, he made.</l>
<l align="r"><it>With his foodle doo</it>!</l></lg>
<lb><lg><l>This carpenter he had a wife,</l>
<l>The plague and torment of his life,</l>
<l>Who, though she did her husband scold,</l>
<l>Loved well a woollen&hyphen;draper bold.</l>
<l align="r"><it>With her foodle doo</it>!</l></lg></p>
<lb><p>&ldquo;I've a toast to propose,&rdquo; cried Sheppard,
filling a bumper. &ldquo;You won't refuse it, Mr.
Kneebone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He'd better not,&rdquo; muttered Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded the woollen&hyphen;draper,
as he returned to the table, and took
up a glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The speedy union of Thames Darrell with
Winifred Wood,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p><pp>Kneebone's cheeks glowed with rage, and he</pp>
<pb n="71">
<pp>set down the wine untasted, while Blueskin resumed
his song.</pp></p>
<lb><lg><l>Now Owen Wood had one fair child,</l>
<l>Unlike her mother, meek and mild;</l>
<l>Her love the draper strove to gain,</l>
<l>But she repaid him with disdain.</l>
<l align="r"><it>With his foodle doo</it>!</l></lg>
<lb><p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>But Blueskin was not to be silenced. He
continued his ditty, in spite of the angry
glances of his leader.</p>
<lb><lg><l>In vain he fondly urged his suit,</l>
<l>And, all in vain, the question put;</l>
<l>She answered,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. William Kneebone,</l>
<l>Of me, sir, you shall never be bone.&rdquo;</l>
<l align="r"><it>With your foodle doo</it>!</l></lg>
<lb><lg><l>&ldquo;Thames Darrell has my heart alone,</l>
<l>A noble youth, e'en <it>you</it> must own;</l>
<l>And, if from him my love could stir,</l>
<l>Jack Sheppard I should much prefer!&rdquo;</l>
<l align="r"><it>With his foodle doo</it>!</l></lg>
<lb><p>&ldquo;Do you refuse my toast?&rdquo; cried Jack, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Kneebone.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Drink this, then,&rdquo; roared Blueskin. And
pouring the contents of a small powder&hyphen;flask</pp>
<pb n="72">
<pp>into a bumper of brandy, he tendered him
the mixture.</pp></p>
<p>At this juncture, the door was opened by
Rachel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you ring for, sir?&rdquo; she asked,
eyeing the group with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your master wants a few table&hyphen;spoons,
child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maggot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the room,&rdquo; interposed Kneebone,
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan't,&rdquo; replied Rachel, saucily.
&ldquo;I came to see Jack Sheppard, and I won't go
till you point him out to me. You told me
he was going back to Newgate after supper, so
I mayn't have another opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he told you that, did he?&rdquo; said
Blueskin, marching up to her, and chucking
her under the chin. &ldquo;I'll show you Captain
Sheppard, my dear. There he stands. I'm
his lieutenant,&mdash;Lieutenant Blueskin. We're
two good&hyphen;looking fellows, ain't we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good&hyphen;looking,&rdquo; replied Rachel. &ldquo;But,
where's the strange gentleman I saw under the
table?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="73">
<p>&ldquo;Under the table!&rdquo; echoed Blueskin, winking
at Jack. &ldquo;When did you see him, my
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short time ago,&rdquo; replied the housekeeper,
unsuspiciously.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;The plot's out!&rdquo; cried Jack. And, without
another word, he seized the table with
both hands, and upset it; scattering plates,
dishes, bottles, jugs, and glasses far and wide.
The crash was tremendous. The lights rolled
over, and were extinguished. And, if Rachel
had not carried a candle, the room would have
been plunged in total darkness. Amid the
confusion, Shotbolt sprang to his feet, and
levelling a pistol at Jack's head, commanded
him to surrender; but, before any reply could
be made, the gaoler's arm was struck up by
Blueskin, who, throwing himself upon him,
dragged him to the ground. In the struggle
the pistol went off, but without damage to
either party. The conflict was of short duration; 
for Shotbolt was no match for his
athletic antagonist. He was speedily disarmed; 
and the rope and gag being found</pp>
<pb n="74">
<pp>upon him, were exultingly turned against him
by his conqueror, who, after pinioning his
arms tightly behind his back, forced open his
mouth with the iron, and effectually prevented
the utterance of any further outcries. While
the strife was raging, Edgeworth Bess walked
up to Rachel, and advised her, if she
valued her life, not to scream or stir from
the spot; a caution which the housekeeper,
whose curiosity far outweighed her fears, received
in very good part.</pp></p>
<p>In the interim, Jack advanced to the woollen&hyphen;draper,
and regarding him sternly, thus addressed
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have violated the laws of hospitality,
Mr. Kneebone. I came hither as your guest.
You have betrayed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What faith is to be kept with a felon?&rdquo; 
replied the woollen&hyphen;draper, disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who breaks faith with his benefactor
may well justify himself thus,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;I have not trusted you. Others who have
done, have found you false.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="75">
<p>&ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; replied Kneebone,
in some confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You soon shall,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard.
&ldquo;Where are the packets committed to your
charge by Sir Rowland Trenchard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The packets!&rdquo; exclaimed Kneebone, in
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless to deny it,&rdquo; replied Jack.
&ldquo;You were watched to&hyphen;night by Blueskin.
You met Sir Rowland at the house of a Romish
priest, Father Spencer. Two packets were
committed to your charge, which you undertook
to deliver,&mdash;one to another priest, Sir
Rowland's chaplain, at Manchester,&mdash;the other
to Mr. Wood. Produce them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by Heaven! you are a dead man!&rdquo; 
replied Jack, cocking a pistol, and pointing it
deliberately at his head. &ldquo;I give you one
minute for reflection. After that time, nothing
shall save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief, breathless pause. Even
Blueskin looked on with anxiety.</p>
<pb n="76">
<p>&ldquo;It is past,&rdquo; said Jack, placing his finger on
the trigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried Kneebone, flinging down the
packets; &ldquo;they are nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are everything to me,&rdquo; cried
Jack, stooping to pick them up. &ldquo;These
packets will establish Thames Darrell's birth,
win him his inheritance, and procure him the
hand of Winifred Wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be too sure of that,&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone,
snatching up the staff, and aiming a
blow at his head, which was fortunately warded
off by Mrs. Maggot, who promptly interposed
her cudgel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defend yourself!&rdquo; cried Jack, drawing his
sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave his punishment to me, Jack,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Maggot. &ldquo;I've the Bridewell account
to settle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Jack, putting up his
blade. &ldquo;I've a good deal to do. Show him
no quarter, Poll. He deserves none.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;And shall find none,&rdquo; replied the Amazon.
&ldquo;Now, Mr. Kneebone,&rdquo; she added, drawing</pp>
<pb n="77">
<pp>up her magnificent figure to its full height,
and making the heavy cudgel whistle through
the air, &ldquo;look to yourself.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand off, Poll,&rdquo; rejoined the woollen&hyphen;draper; 
&ldquo;I don't want to hurt you. It shall
never be said that I raised my arm willingly
against a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll forgive you all the harm you do me,&rdquo; 
rejoined the Amazon. &ldquo;What! you still hesitate!
Will that rouse you, coward?&rdquo; And
she gave him a smart rap on the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; cried Kneebone. &ldquo;Neither man
nor woman shall apply that term to me. If
you forget your sex, jade, I must forget mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, he attacked her vigorously in his
turn.</p>
<p><pp>It was a curious sight to see how this extraordinary
woman, who, it has been said, was not
less remarkable for the extreme delicacy of her
features, and the faultless symmetry of her
figure, than for her wonderful strength and
agility, conducted herself in the present encounter; 
with what dexterity she parried every
blow aimed against her by her adversary,</pp>
<pb n="78">
<pp>whose head and face, already marked by various
ruddy streams, showed how successfully
her own hits had been made;&mdash;how she drew
him hither and thither, now leading him on,
now driving him suddenly back; harassing and
exhausting him in every possible way, and
making it apparent that she could at any moment
put an end to the fight, and only delayed
the finishing stroke to make his punishment
the more severe.</pp></p>
<p>Jack, meanwhile, with Blueskin's assistance,
had set the table once more upon its legs, and
placing writing materials, which he took from
a shelf, upon it, made Shotbolt, who was still
gagged, but whose arms were for the moment
unbound, sit down before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write as I dictate,&rdquo; he cried, placing a pen
in the gaoler's hand and a pistol to his ear.</p>
<p>Shotbolt nodded in token of acquiescence,
and emitted an odd guttural sound.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Write as follows,&rdquo; continued Jack. &ldquo;&lsquo;I
have succeeded in capturing Jack Sheppard.
The reward is mine. Get all ready for his
reception. In a few minutes after the delivery</pp>
<pb n="79">
<pp>of this note he will be in Newgate.&rsquo; Sign it,&rdquo; 
he added, as, after some further threats, the
letter was indited according to his dictation,
&ldquo;and direct it to Mr. Austin. That's well.
And, now, to find a messenger.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kneebone's man is in the shop,&rdquo; said
Rachel; &ldquo;he'll take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I trust him?&rdquo; mused Jack. &ldquo;Yes; 
he'll suspect nothing. Give him this letter,
child, and bid him take it to the Lodge at
Newgate without loss of time. Blueskin will
go with you,&mdash;for fear of a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might trust me,&rdquo; said Rachel, in an
offended tone; &ldquo;but never mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she left the room with Blueskin, who
very politely offered her his arm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the combat between Kneebone
and Mrs. Maggot had been brought to a termination.
When the woollen&hyphen;draper was nearly
worn out, the Amazon watched her opportunity,
and hitting him on the arm, disabled
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's for Mrs. Wood,&rdquo; she cried, as the
staff fell from his grasp.</p>
<pb n="80">
<p>&ldquo;I'm at your mercy, Poll,&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone,
abjectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's for Winifred,&rdquo; vociferated the
Amazon, bringing the cudgel heavily upon
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; cried Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's for myself,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Maggot,
dealing him a blow, which stretched him senseless
on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Poll!&rdquo; cried Jack, who having
again pinioned Shotbolt, was now tracing a few
hasty lines on a sheet of paper. &ldquo;You've
given him a broken head, I perceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He'll scarcely need a plaister,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Maggot, laughing. &ldquo;Here, Bess, give
me the cord, and I'll tie him to this chest of
drawers. I don't think he'll come to himself
too soon. But it's best to be on the safe
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Decidedly so,&rdquo; replied Edgeworth Bess; 
&ldquo;and I'll take this opportunity, while Jack's
back is turned,&mdash;for he's grown so strangely
particular,&mdash;of easing him of his snuff&hyphen;box.
Perhaps,&rdquo; she added, in a whisper, as she appropriated</pp>
<pb n="81">
<pp>the before&hyphen;named article, &ldquo;he has a
pocket&hyphen;book.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Maggot; &ldquo;Jack
will hear you. We'll come back for that by
and by, and the dressing&hyphen;gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, Rachel and Blueskin returned.
Their momentary absence seemed to
have worked wonders; for now the most perfect
understanding appeared to subsist between
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you sent off the note?&rdquo; inquired
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have, captain,&rdquo; replied Blueskin. &ldquo;I
say <it>we</it>, because Miss Rachel and I have struck
up a match. Shall I bring off anything?&rdquo; he
added, looking eagerly round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jack, peremptorily.</p>
<p><pp>Having now sealed his letter, Sheppard took
a handkerchief, and tying it over Shotbolt's
face, so as completely to conceal the features,
clapped his hat upon his head, and pushed it
over his brows. He, next, seized the unlucky
gaoler, and forced him along, while Blueskin</pp>
<pb n="82">
<pp>expedited his movements by administering a
few kicks behind.</pp></p>
<p>When they got to the door, Jack opened it,
and, mimicking the voice of the gaoler, shouted,
&ldquo;Now, my lads, all's ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; cried the chairmen, hurrying
out of the court with their swinging vehicle,
&ldquo;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Sheppard, dragging out
Shotbolt by the collar, while Blueskin pushed
him behind, and Mrs. Maggot held up a lantern,
which she found in the shop. &ldquo;In with
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;ay, yer hon'r,&rdquo; cried the foremost
chairman, lending a helping hand. &ldquo;Get in
wid ye, ye villin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, despite his resistance, Shotbolt was
thrust into the chair, which was instantly
fastened upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, he's as safe as Jack Sheppard
in the Condemned Hould,&rdquo; laughed the
man.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Off with you to Newgate!&rdquo; cried Jack,
&ldquo;and don't let him out till you get inside the</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>293Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010123">
<pb n="83">
<pp>Lodge. There's a letter for the head turnkey,
Mr. Ireton. D'ye hear.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yer hon'r,&rdquo; replied the chairman,
taking the note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; asked Jack,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gen'l'man as hired us,&rdquo; replied the
chairman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he'll be after you directly. He's settling
an account in the house. Lose no time.
The letter will explain all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chair was then rapidly put in motion,
and speedily disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's to be done next?&rdquo; cried Blueskin,
returning to Rachel, who was standing
with Edgeworth Bess near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go back and finish my supper,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Maggot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so shall I,&rdquo; replied Edgeworth Bess.
&ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; cried Jack, detaining his
mistresses. &ldquo;Here we part,&mdash;perhaps for ever.
I've already told you I'm about to take a long
journey, and it's more than probable I shall
never return.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="84">
<p>&ldquo;Don't say so,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maggot. &ldquo;I
should be perfectly miserable if I thought you
in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very idea is dreadful,&rdquo; whimpered
Edgeworth Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; cried Jack, embracing them.
&ldquo;Take this key to Baptist Kettleby. On
seeing it, he'll deliver you a box, which it
will unlock, and in which you'll find a matter
of fifty guineas and a few trinkets. Divide the
money between you, and wear the ornaments
for my sake. But, if you've a spark of love for
me, don't meddle with anything in that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds!&rdquo; exclaimed both ladies
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; cried Jack, breaking from them,
and rushing down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do, Poll?&rdquo; hesitated Edgeworth
Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in, to be sure, simpleton,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Maggot, &ldquo;and bring off all we can. I know
where everything valuable is kept. Since Jack
has left us, what does it matter whether he's
pleased or not?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="85">
<p>At this moment, a whistle was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; cried Blueskin, who was still
lingering with Rachel. &ldquo;The captain's in
such a desperate hurry, that there's no time for
love&hyphen;making. Adieu! my charmer. You'll
find those young ladies extremely agreeable
acquaintances. Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, snatching a hasty kiss, he darted after
Jack.</p>
<p>The chair, meanwhile, with its unhappy
load, was transported at a brisk pace to Newgate.
Arrived there, the porters thundered at
the massive door of the Lodge, which was instantly
opened&mdash;Shotbolt's note having been
received just before. All the turnkeys were
assembled. Ireton and Langley had returned
from a second unsuccessful search; Marvel had
come thither to bid good&hyphen;night to Mrs. Spurling; 
Austin had never quitted his post. The
tapstress was full of curiosity; but she appeared
more easy than the others. Behind her
stood Caliban, chuckling to himself, and grinning
from ear to ear.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, who'd have thought of Shotbolt</pp>
<pb n="86">
<pp>beating us all in this way!&rdquo; said Ireton. &ldquo;I'm
sorry for old Newgate that another gaol should
have it. It's infernally provoking.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Infernally provoking!&rdquo; echoed Langley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody has so much cause for complaint
as me,&rdquo; growled Austin. &ldquo;I've lost my
wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty pounds,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Spurling.
&ldquo;I witnessed the bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; cried Ireton, as the knocking
was heard without. &ldquo;Get ready the irons,
Caliban.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, massa,&rdquo; replied the grinning
negro,&mdash;&ldquo;lilly bit&mdash;see all right fust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, the chair had been brought
into the Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've got him?&rdquo; demanded Ireton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe inside,&rdquo; replied the chairman, wiping
the heat from his brow; &ldquo;we've run all the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where's Mr. Shotbolt?&rdquo; asked Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gen'l'man'll be here directly. He was
detained. T'other gen'l'man said the letter 'ud
explain all.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="87">
<p>&ldquo;Detained!&rdquo; echoed Marvel. &ldquo;That's odd.
But, let's see the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chair was then opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shotbolt! by&wblank;&rdquo; cried Austin, as the
captive was dragged forth. &ldquo;I've won, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exclamations of wonder burst from all. Mrs.
Spurling bit her lips to conceal her mirth.
Caliban absolutely crowed with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear the letter,&rdquo; said Ireton, breaking the
seal. &ldquo;&lsquo;<it>This is the way in which I will serve
all who attempt to apprehend me.</it>&rsquo; It is signed
<smallcap>Jack Sheppard.</smallcap>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, so Jack Sheppard has sent back Shotbolt
in this pickle,&rdquo; said Langley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo; replied Marvel. &ldquo;Untie
his arms, and take off that handkerchief. The
poor fellow's half smothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess what share you've had in this,&rdquo; 
whispered Austin to Mrs. Spurling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; replied the tapstress. &ldquo;You've
won your wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Half an hour after this occurrence, when it
had been sufficiently laughed at and discussed;</pp>
<pb n="88">
<pp>when the wager had been settled, and the chairman
dismissed with the remaining three guineas,
which Shotbolt was compelled to pay; Ireton
arose, and signified his intention of stepping
across the street to inform Mr. Wild of the
circumstance.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;As it's getting late, and the porter may be
gone to bed,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;I'll take the passkey,
and let myself in. Mr. Wild is sure to
be up. He never retires to rest till daybreak&mdash; 
if at all. Come with me, Langley, and bring
the lantern.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Jack Sheppard</smallcap>, after whistling to Blueskin,
hurried down a short thoroughfare leading
from Wych Street to the back of Saint Clement's
Church, where he found Thames Darrell,
who advanced to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going,&rdquo; said Thames. &ldquo;When
I parted from you at Mr. Kneebone's door,
you begged me to await your return here,
assuring me you would not detain me five
minutes. Instead of which, more than half an
hour has elapsed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You won't complain of the delay when I
tell you what I've done,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;I've obtained two packets, containing letters
from Sir Rowland Trenchard, which I've no</pp>
<pb n="90">
<pp>doubt will establish your title to the estates.
Take them, and may they prove as serviceable
to you as I desire.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; replied Thames, greatly moved,
&ldquo;I wish I could devise any means of brightening
your own dark prospects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's impossible,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I
am utterly lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not utterly,&rdquo; rejoined the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utterly,&rdquo; reiterated Jack, gloomily,&mdash;&ldquo;as
regards all I hold dear. Listen to me,
Thames. I'm about to leave this country
for ever. Having ascertained that a vessel
sails for France from the river at daybreak
to&hyphen;morrow morning, I have secured a passage
in her, and have already had the few effects I
possess, conveyed on board. Blueskin goes
with me. The faithful fellow will never leave
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, while I've breath in my body,
captain,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin, who had joined
them. &ldquo;England or France, London or
Paris, it's all one to me, so I've you to command
me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="91">
<p>&ldquo;Stand out of earshot,&rdquo; rejoined his leader.
&ldquo;I'll call you when you're wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Blueskin withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot but approve the course you are
about to take, Jack,&rdquo; said Thames, &ldquo;though
on some accounts I regret it. In after years
you can return to your own country&mdash;to your
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Sheppard bitterly. &ldquo;My
friends need not fear my return. They shall
hear of me no more. Under another name,&mdash; 
not my own hateful one,&mdash;I will strive to distinguish
myself in some foreign service, and
win myself a reputation, or perish honourably.
But I will never&mdash;never return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not attempt to combat your resolution,
Jack,&rdquo; returned Thames, after a pause.
&ldquo;But I dread the effect your departure may
have upon your poor mother. Her life hangs
upon a thread, and this may snap it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I wish you hadn't mentioned her,&rdquo; said
Jack, in a broken voice, while his whole frame
shook with emotion. &ldquo;What I do is for the
best, and I can only hope she may have</pp>
<pb n="92">
<pp>strength to bear the separation. You must
say farewell to her, for I cannot. I don't ask
you to supply my place&mdash;for that is, perhaps,
impossible. But, be like a son to her.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not doubt me,&rdquo; replied Thames, warmly
pressing his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, I've one further request,&rdquo; 
faltered Jack; &ldquo;though I scarcely know how
to make it. It is to set me right with Winifred.
Do not let her think worse of me than I
deserve,&mdash;or even so ill. Tell her, that more
than once, when about to commit some desperate
offence, I have been restrained by her
gentle image. If hopeless love for her made
me a robber, it has also saved me many a crime.
Will you tell her that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Thames, earnestly.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Jack, recovering his composure.
&ldquo;And now, to your own concerns.
Blueskin, who has been on the watch all night,
has dogged Sir Rowland Trenchard to Jonathan
Wild's house; and, from the mysterious
manner in which he was admitted by the thieftaker's
confidential servant, Abraham Mendez,</pp>
<pb n="93">
<pp>and not by the regular porter, there is little
doubt but they are alone, and probably making
some arrangements prior to our uncle's departure
from England.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he leaving England?&rdquo; demanded Thames,
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sails to&hyphen;morrow morning in the very
vessel by which I start,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Now,
if as I suspect,&mdash;from the documents just
placed in your possession,&mdash;Sir Rowland meditates
doing you justice after his departure, it is
possible his intentions may be frustrated by
the machinations of Wild, whose interest is
obviously to prevent such an occurrence, unless
we can surprise them together, and, by
proving to Sir Rowland that we possess the
power of compelling a restitution of your
rights, force the other treacherous villain into
compliance. Jonathan, in all probability, knows
nothing of these packets; and their production
may serve to intimidate him. Will you
venture?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It is a hazardous experiment,&rdquo; said Thames,
after a moment's reflection; &ldquo;but I will make</pp>
<pb n="94">
<pp>it. You must not, however, accompany me,
Jack. The risk I run is nothing to yours.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I care for no risk, provided I can serve
you,&rdquo; rejoined Sheppard. &ldquo;Besides, you'll
not be able to get in without me. It won't do
to knock at the door, and Jonathan Wild's
house is not quite so easy of entrance as Mr.
Wood's.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied Thames; &ldquo;be it as
you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, we'll lose no more time,&rdquo; returned
Jack. &ldquo;Come along, Blueskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Starting at a rapid pace in the direction of
the Old Bailey, and crossing Fleet Bridge,
&ldquo;for oyster tubs renowned,&rdquo; the trio skirted
the right bank of the muddy stream until they
reached Fleet Lane, up which they hurried.
Turning off again on the left, down Seacoal
Lane, they arrived at the mouth of a dark,
narrow alley, into which they plunged; and,
at the farther extremity found a small yard,
overlooked by the blank walls of a large
gloomy habitation. A door in this house</pp>
<pb n="95">
<pp>opened upon the yard. Jack tried it, and
found it locked.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had my old tools with me, we'd soon
master this obstacle,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;We shall
be obliged to force it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the cellar, captain,&rdquo; said Blueskin,
stamping upon a large board in the ground.
&ldquo;Here's the door. This is the way the old
thief brings in all his heavy plunder, which he
stows in out&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;way holes in his infernal
dwelling. I've seen him often do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While making these remarks, Blueskin contrived,
by means of a chisel which he chanced
to have about him, to lift up the board, and,
introducing his fingers beneath it, with Jack's
assistance speedily opened it altogether, disclosing
a dark hole, into which he leapt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, Thames, cried Jack, dropping
into the chasm.</p>
<p>They were now in a sort of cellar, at one end
of which was a door. It was fastened inside.
But, taking the chisel from Blueskin, Jack
quickly forced back the bolt.</p>
<pb n="96">
<p>As they entered the room beyond, a fierce
growl was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go first,&rdquo; said Blueskin; &ldquo;the
dogs know me. Soho! boys.&rdquo; And, walking
up to the animals, which were chained to the
wall, they instantly recognised him, and suffered
the others to pass without barking.</p>
<p>Groping their way through one or two dark
and mouldy&hyphen;smelling vaults, the party ascended
a flight of steps, which brought them to the
hall. As Jack conjectured, no one was there; 
and, though a lamp was burning on a stand,
they decided upon proceeding without it.
They then swiftly mounted the stairs, and
stopped before the audience&hyphen;chamber. Applying
his ear to the keyhole, Jack listened, but
could detect no sound. He, next cautiously
tried the door, but found it fastened inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear we're too late,&rdquo; he whispered to
Thames. &ldquo;But, we'll soon see. Give me the
chisel, Blueskin.&rdquo; And, dexterously applying
the implement, he forced open the lock.</p>
<p>They then entered the room, which was perfectly
dark.</p>
<pb n="97">
<p>&ldquo;This is strange,&rdquo; said Jack, under his
breath. &ldquo;Sir Rowland must be gone. And
yet, I don't know. The key's in the lock, on
the inner side. Be on your guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so,&rdquo; replied Thames, who had followed
him closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I fetch the light, captain?&rdquo; whispered
Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I don't know how
it is,&rdquo; he added in a low voice to Thames, as
they were left alone, &ldquo;but I've a strange foreboding
of ill. My heart fails me. I almost
wish we hadn't come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, he moved forward a few
paces, when, finding his feet glued to the
ground by some adhesive substance, he stooped
to feel what it was, but instantly withdrew his
hand, with an exclamation of horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God in heaven!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the floor is
covered with blood. Some foul murder has
been committed? The light!&mdash;the light!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Astounded at his cries, Thames sprang towards
him. At this moment, Blueskin appeared
with the lamp, and revealed a horrible spectacle,</pp>
<pb n="98">
<pp>&mdash;the floor deluged with blood,&mdash;various
articles of furniture upset,&mdash;papers scattered
about,&mdash;the murdered man's cloak, trampled
upon and smeared with gore,&mdash;his hat, crushed
and similarly stained,&mdash;his sword,&mdash;the
ensanguined cloth,&mdash;with several other ghastly
evidences of the slaughterous deed. Further
on, there were impressions of bloody footsteps
along the floor.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Rowland is murdered!&rdquo; cried Jack, as
soon as he could find a tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is plain he has been destroyed by
his perfidious accomplice,&rdquo; rejoined Thames.
&ldquo;Oh God! how fearfully my father is
avenged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Jack, sternly; &ldquo;but we
have our uncle to avenge. What's this?&rdquo; he
added, stooping to pick up a piece of paper
lying at his feet&mdash;it was Jonathan's memorandum.
&ldquo;This is the explanation of the bloody
deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's a pocket&hyphen;book full of notes, and a
heavy bag of gold,&rdquo; said Blueskin, examining
the articles on the floor.</p>
<pb n="99">
<p>&ldquo;The sum which incited the villain to the
murder,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;But he can't be far
off. He must be gone to dispose of the body.
We shall have him on his return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll see where these footsteps lead to,&rdquo; 
said Blueskin, holding the light to the floor.
&ldquo;Here are some more papers, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them to me,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; 
he exclaimed, &ldquo;a letter, beginning &lsquo;dearest
Aliva,&rsquo;&mdash;that's your mother's name, Thames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; cried Thames, snatching it
from him. &ldquo;It <it>is</it> addressed to my mother,&rdquo; 
he added, as his eye glanced rapidly over it,
&ldquo;and by my father. At length, I shall ascertain
my name. Bring the light this way&mdash; 
quick! I cannot decipher the signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was about to comply with the request,
when an unlooked&hyphen;for interruption occurred.
Having traced the footsteps to the wall, and
perceiving no outlet, Blueskin elevated the
lamp, and discovered marks of bloody fingers
on the boards.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;He must have gone this way,&rdquo; muttered
Blueskin. &ldquo;I've often heard of a secret door</pp>
<pb n="100">
<pp>in this room, though I never saw it. It must
be somewhere hereabouts. Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
as his eye fell upon a small knob in the wall,
&ldquo;there's the spring!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>He touched it, and the door flew open.</p>
<p>The next moment, he was felled to the
ground by Jonathan Wild, who sprang into
the room, followed by Abraham bearing the link.
A single glance served to show the thieftaker
how matters stood. From the slight sounds
that had reached him in his place of confinement,
he was aware that some persons had
found their way to the scene of slaughter, and
in a state of the most intense anxiety awaited
the result of their investigation, prepared for
the worst. Hearing the spring touched, he
dashed through on the instant, and struck
down the person who presented himself, with
his bludgeon. On beholding the intruders,
his fears changed to exultation, and he uttered
a roar of satisfaction as he glared at them,
which could only be likened to the cry of
some savage denizen of the plains.</p>
<p><pp>On his appearance, Jack levelled a pistol</pp>
<pb n="101">
<pp>at his head. But his hand was withheld by
Thames.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't fire,&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;It is important
not to slay him. He shall expiate his
offences on the gibbet. You are my prisoner,
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>Your</it> prisoner!&rdquo; echoed Jonathan, derisively.
&ldquo;You mistake,&mdash;you are mine. And
so is your companion,&mdash;the convict Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waste not another word with him,
Thames,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Upon him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yield, villain, or die!&rdquo; shouted Thames,
drawing his sword, and springing towards
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's my answer!&rdquo; rejoined Wild, hurling
the bludgeon at him, with such fatal effect,
that striking him on the head it brought him
instantly to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! traitor!&rdquo; cried Jack, pulling the
trigger of his pistol.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Anticipating this, Wild avoided the shot
by suddenly ducking his head. He had a
narrow escape, however; for, passing within</pp>
<pb n="102">
<pp>an inch of him, the bullet buried itself deeply
in the wall.</pp></p>
<p>Before he could fire a second shot, Jack had
to defend himself from the thieftaker, who,
with his drawn hanger, furiously assaulted him.
Eluding the blow, Jack plucked his sword
from the scabbard, and a desperate conflict
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up that blade, Nab,&rdquo; vociferated
Wild, finding himself hotly pressed, &ldquo;and stab
him. I won't give him a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cowardly villain!&rdquo; cried Jack, as the Jew,
obeying the orders of his principal, snatched
up the weapon of the murdered man, and
assailed him. &ldquo;But I'll yet disappoint you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And springing backwards, he darted suddenly
through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him,&rdquo; cried Wild; &ldquo;he mustn't
escape. Dead or alive, I'll have him. Bring
the link.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, followed by Abraham, he rushed out
of the room.</p>
<p><pp>Just as Jack got half way down the stairs,
and Wild and the Jew reached the upper landing,</pp>
<pb n="103">
<pp>the street&hyphen;door was opened by Langley
and Ireton, the latter of whom carried a
lantern.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; shouted Jonathan from the
stair&hyphen;head, &ldquo;stop him! It's Jack Sheppard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give way!&rdquo; cried Jack fiercely. &ldquo;I'll cut
down him who opposes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head turnkey, in all probability, would
have obeyed. But, being pushed forward by
his subordinate officer, he was compelled to
make a stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'd better surrender quietly, Jack,&rdquo; he
cried; &ldquo;you've no chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of regarding him, Jack glanced over
the iron banisters, and measured the distance.
But the fall was too great, and he abandoned
the attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have him!&rdquo; cried Jonathan, hurrying
down the steps. &ldquo;He can't escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>As this was said, Jack turned with the swiftness
of thought, and shortening his sword,
prepared to plunge it into the thieftaker's heart.
Before he could make the thrust, however, he</pp>
<pb n="104">
<pp>was seized behind by Ireton, who flung himself
upon him.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo; shouted the head&hyphen;turnkey. &ldquo;I
give you joy of the capture, Mr. Wild,&rdquo; he
added, as Jonathan came up, and assisted him
to secure and disarm the prisoner. &ldquo;I was
coming to give you intelligence of a comical
trick played by this rascal, when I find him
here&mdash;the last place, I own, where I should
have expected to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've arrived in the very nick of time,&rdquo; 
rejoined Jonathan; &ldquo;and I'll take care your
services are not overlooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ireton,&rdquo; cried Jack, in accents of the
most urgent entreaty. &ldquo;Before you take me
hence, I implore you&mdash;if you would further
the ends of justice&mdash;search this house. One
of the most barbarous murders ever committed
has just been perpetrated by the monster Wild.
You will find proofs of the bloody deed in his
room. But go thither at once, I beseech you,
before he has time to remove them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Mr. Ireton is welcome to search every
room in my house if he pleases,&rdquo; said Jonathan,</pp>
<pb n="105">
<pp>in a tone of bravado. &ldquo;As soon as we've conveyed
you to Newgate, I'll accompany him.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ireton will do not such thing,&rdquo; replied
the head&hyphen;turnkey. &ldquo;Bless your soul! d'ye
think I'm to be gammoned by such nonsense.
Not I. I'm not quite such a green&hyphen;horn as
Shotbolt, Jack, whatever you may think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy's sake go up stairs,&rdquo; implored
Sheppard. &ldquo;I have not told you half. There's
a man dying&mdash;Captain Darrell. Take me with
you. Place a pistol at my ear, and shoot me,
if I've told you false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, what good would that do?&rdquo; replied
Ireton, sarcastically. &ldquo;To shoot you would
be to lose the reward. You act your part
capitally, but it won't do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't you go?&rdquo; cried Jack passionately.
&ldquo;Mr. Langley, I appeal to you. Murder, I
say, has been done! Another murder will be
committed if you don't prevent it. The blood
will rest on your head. Do you hear me, sir?
Won't you stir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a step,&rdquo; replied Langley, gruffly.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Off with him to Newgate!&rdquo; cried Jonathan.</pp>
<pb n="106">
<pp>&ldquo;Ireton, as you captured him, the reward is
yours. But I request that a third may be
given to Langley.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be, sir,&rdquo; replied Ireton, bowing.
&ldquo;Now come along, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miscreants!&rdquo; cried Sheppard, almost driven
frantic by the violence of his emotions; &ldquo;you're
all in league with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away with him!&rdquo; cried Jonathan. &ldquo;I'll
see him fettered myself. Remain at the door,
Nab,&rdquo; he added, loitering for a moment behind
the others, &ldquo;and let no one in, or
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Jack, meanwhile, was carried to Newgate.
Austin could scarcely credit his senses when
he beheld him. Shotbolt, who had in some
degree recovered from the effects of his previous
mortification, was thrown into an ecstacy
of delight, and could not sufficiently exult over
the prisoner. Mrs. Spurling had retired for
the night. Jack appealed to the new auditors,
and again detailed his story, but with no better
success than heretofore. His statement was
treated with derision. Having seen him heavily</pp>
<pb n="107">
<pp>ironed, and placed in the Condemned Hold,
Jonathan recrossed the street.</pp></p>
<p>He found Abraham on guard as he had
left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any one been here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No von,&rdquo; replied the Jew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's well,&rdquo; replied Wild, entering the
house, and fastening the door. &ldquo;And now to
dispose of our dead. Why, Nab, you shake
as if you'd got an ague?&rdquo; he added, turning
to the Jew, whose teeth chattered audibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven't quite recovered the fright I got
in the Vell&hyphen;Hole,&rdquo; replied Abraham.</p>
<p><pp>On returning to the audience&hyphen;chamber, Jonathan
found the inanimate body of Thames
Darrell lying where he had left it; but, on
examining it, he remarked that the pockets
were turned inside out, and had evidently been
rifled. Startled by this circumstance, he looked
around, and perceived that the trap&hyphen;door,&mdash; 
which has been mentioned as communicating
with a secret staircase,&mdash;was open. He, next,
discovered that Blueskin was gone; and, pursuing
his scrutiny, found that he had carried</pp>
<pb n="108">
<pp>off all the bank&hyphen;notes, gold, and letters,&mdash;including,
what Jonathan himself was not aware
of,&mdash;the two packets which he had abstracted
from the person of Thames. Uttering a terrible
imprecation, Jonathan snatched up the link,
and hastily descended the stairs, leaving the
Jew behind him. After a careful search below,
he could detect no trace of Blueskin. But,
finding the cellar&hyphen;door open, concluded he had
got out that way.</pp></p>
<p>Returning to the audience&hyphen;chamber in a by&hyphen;no&hyphen;means
enviable state of mind, he commanded
the Jew to throw the body of Thames into
the Well&hyphen;Hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You musht do dat shob yourself, Mishter
Vild,&rdquo; rejoined Abraham, shaking his head.
&ldquo;No pripe shall indushe me to enter dat
horrid plashe again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; cried Wild, taking up the body,
&ldquo;what are you afraid of? After all,&rdquo; he added,
pausing, &ldquo;he may be of more use to me alive
than dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Adhering to this change of plan, he ordered
Abraham to follow him, and, descending the</pp>
<pb n="109">
<pp>secret stairs once more, carried the wounded
man into the lower part of the premises. Unlocking
several doors, he came to a dark vault,
that would have rivalled the gloomiest cell in
Newgate, into which he thrust Thames, and
fastened the door.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the pump, Nab,&rdquo; he said, when this
was done, &ldquo;and fill a pail with water. We must
wash out those stains up stairs, and burn the
cloth. Blood, they say, won't come out. But
I never found any truth in the saying. When
I've had an hour's rest, I'll be after Blueskin.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><pp><smallcap>As</smallcap> soon as it became known, through the
medium of the public prints on the following
day, that Jack Sheppard had broken out of
prison, and had been again captured during
the night, fresh curiosity was excited, and
larger crowds than ever flocked to Newgate,
in the hope of obtaining admission to his cell; 
but by the governor's express commands, Wild
having privately counselled the step, no one
was allowed to see him. A question next arose
whether the prisoner could be executed under
the existing warrant,&mdash;some inclining to one
opinion, some to another. To settle the point,
the governor started to Windsor, delegating
his trust in the interim to Wild, who took
advantage of his brief rule to adopt the</pp>
<pb n="111">
<pp>harshest measures towards the prisoner. He
had him removed from the Condemned Hold,
stripped of his fine apparel, clothed in the
most sordid rags, loaded with additional fetters,
and thrust into the Stone Hold,&mdash;already described
as the most noisome cell in the whole
prison. Here, without a glimpse of daylight; 
visited by no one except Austin at stated intervals,
who neither answered a question nor addressed
a word to him; fed upon the worst
diet, literally mouldy bread and ditch&hyphen;water; 
surrounded by stone walls; with a flagged
floor for his pillow, and without so much as a
blanket to protect him from the death&hyphen;like cold
that pierced his frame,&mdash;Jack's stout heart was
subdued, and he fell into the deepest dejection,
ardently longing for the time when even a
violent death should terminate his sufferings.
But it was not so ordered. Mr. Pitt returned
with intelligence that the warrant was delayed,
and, on taking the opinion of two eminent
lawyers of the day, Sir William Thomson and
Mr. Serjeant Raby, it was decided that it
must be proved in a regular and judicial</pp>
<pb n="112">
<pp>manner that Sheppard was the identical person
who had been convicted and had escaped,
before a fresh order could be made for his
execution; and that the matter must, therefore,
stand over until the next sessions, to be
held at the Old Bailey in October, when it
could be brought before the court.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The unfortunate prisoner, meanwhile, who
was not informed of the respite, languished in
his horrible dungeon, and, at the expiration of
three weeks, became so seriously indisposed
that it was feared he could not long survive.
He refused his food,&mdash;and even when better
provisions were offered him, rejected them. As
his death was by no means what Jonathan desired,
he resolved to remove him to a more airy
ward, and afford him such slight comforts as
might tend to his restoration, or at least keep
him alive until the period of execution. With
this view, Jack was carried&mdash;for he was no
longer able to move without assistance&mdash;to a
ward called the Castle, situated over the gateway
on the western side, in what was considered the
strongest part of the gaol. The walls were of</pp>
<pb n="113">
<pp>immense thickness; the small windows doublegrated
and unglazed; the fire&hyphen;place was without
a grate; and a barrack&hyphen;bed, divided into
two compartments, occupied one corner. It was
about twelve feet high, nine wide, and fourteen
long; and was approached by double doors
each six inches thick. As Jack appeared to
be sinking fast, his fetters were removed, his
own clothes were returned to him, and he was
allowed a mattress and a scanty supply of bedlinen.
Mrs. Spurling attended him as his
nurse, and, under her care, he speedily revived.
As soon as he became convalescent, and all fears
of his premature dissolution were at an end,
Wild recommenced his rigorous treatment. The
bedding was removed; Mrs. Spurling was no
longer allowed to visit him; he was again loaded
with irons; fastened by an enormous horse&hyphen;padlock
to a staple in the floor; and only allowed
to take repose in a chair. A single blanket
constituted his sole covering at night. In spite
of all this, he grew daily better and stronger,
and his spirits revived. Hitherto, no visiters
had been permitted to see him. As the time</pp>
<pb n="114">
<pp>when his identity had to be proved approached,
this rigour was, in a trifling degree, relaxed,
and a few persons were occasionally admitted
to the ward, but only in the presence of Austin.
From none of these could Jack ascertain what
had become of Thames, or learn any particulars
concerning the family at Dollis Hill, or of his
mother. Austin, who had been evidently
schooled by Wild, maintained a profound
silence on this head. In this way, more than a
month passed over. October arrived; and in
another week the court would be sitting at the
Old Bailey.</pp></p>
<p><pp>One night, about this time, just as Austin
was about to lock the great gate, Jonathan Wild
and his two janizaries entered the Lodge with
a prisoner bound hand and foot. It was Blueskin.
On the cords being removed, he made a
desperate spring at Wild, bore him to the
ground, clutched at his throat, and would, infallibly,
have strangled him, if the keepers had
not all thrown themselves upon him, and by
main force torn him off. His struggles were
so violent, that, being a man of tremendous</pp>
<pb n="115">
<pp>strength, it was some time before they could
master him, and it required the combined
efforts of all the four partners to put him into
irons. It appeared from what he said that he
had been captured when asleep,&mdash;that his
liquor had been drugged,&mdash;otherwise, he would
never have allowed himself to be taken alive.
Wild, he asserted, had robbed him of a large
sum of money, and till it was restored he would
never plead.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll see that,&rdquo; replied Jonathan. &ldquo;Take
him to the Bilbowes. Put him in the stocks,
and there let him sleep off his drunken fit.
Whether he pleads or not, he shall swing with
his confederate, Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this allusion to his leader, a shudder passed
through Blueskin's athletic frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let me see
him. Let me have a word with him, and you
may take all the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan made no answer, but motioned the
partners to take him away.</p>
<p><pp>As soon as Blueskin was removed, Wild intimated
his intention of visiting the Castle.</pp>
<pb n="116">
<pp>He was accompanied by Ireton and Austin.
The massive door was unlocked, and they
entered the cell. What was their surprise to
find it vacant, and the prisoner gone! Jonathan
could scarcely believe his eyes. He looked
fiercely and inquiringly from one to the other
of his companions; but, though both of them
were excessively frightened, neither appeared
guilty. Before a word could be said, however,
a slight noise was heard in the chimney, and
Jack with his irons on descended from it.
Without betraying the slightest confusion, or
making a single remark, he quietly resumed his
seat.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazement!&rdquo; cried Wild. &ldquo;How has he
unfastened his padlock? Austin, it must be
owing to your negligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My negligence, Mr. Wild,&rdquo; said the turnkey,
trembling in every joint. &ldquo;I assure you,
sir, when I left him an hour ago, it was locked.
I tried it myself, sir. I'm as much astonished
as you. But I can't account for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all events, you shall answer for it,&rdquo; 
thundered Wild, with a bitter imprecation.</p>
<pb n="117">
<p>&ldquo;He's not to blame,&rdquo; said Jack, rising.
&ldquo;I opened the padlock with this crooked nail,
which I found in the floor. If you had arrived
ten minutes later, or if there hadn't been an
iron bar in the chimney, that hindered my
progress, I should have been beyond your
reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk boldly,&rdquo; replied Wild. &ldquo;Go to
the Iron Hold, Austin, and tell two of the
partners to bring another padlock of the largest
size, and the heaviest handcuffs they can find.
We'll try whether he'll get loose again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheppard said nothing, but a disdainful smile
curled his lips.</p>
<p>Austin departed, and presently afterwards
returned with the two subordinate officers, each
of whom wore a leathern apron round his waist,
and carried a large hammer. As soon as the
manacles were slipped over the prisoner's wrists,
and the new padlock secured to the staple, they
withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone with him a moment,&rdquo; said
Jonathan. And the gaolers also retired.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Wild, with a glance of malignant</pp>
<pb n="118">
<pp>triumph, &ldquo;I will now tell you what I have
done. All my plans have succeeded. Before
a month has elapsed, your mother will be mine.
The Trenchard estates will likewise be mine,
for Sir Rowland is no more, and the youth,
Thames, will never again see daylight. Blueskin,
who had evaded me with the papers and
the money, is a prisoner here, and will perish
on the same gallows as yourself. My vengeance
is completely gratified.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, but darting a
malevolent look at the prisoner, he quitted the
cell, the door of which was instantly double&hyphen;locked
and bolted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've not quite done yet,&rdquo; said Jonathan, as
he joined the turnkeys. &ldquo;I should like to see
whether Blueskin is a little more composed.
I've a question to ask him. Give me the keys
and the light. I'll go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>So saying, he descended a short spiral staircase,
and, entering a long stone gallery, from
which several other passages branched, took one
of them, and after various turnings&mdash;for he
was familiar with all the intricacies of the</pp>
<pb n="119">
<pp>prison&mdash;arrived at the cell of which he was in
search. Selecting a key from the heavy bunch
committed to him by Austin, he threw open
the door, and beheld Blueskin seated at the
back of the small chamber, handcuffed, and with
his feet confined in a heavy pair of stocks. He
was asleep when Jonathan entered, and growled
at being disturbed. But, as soon as he perceived
who it was, he roused himself, and glared
fiercely at the intruder from under his bent
brows.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked, in a gruff
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know what you've done with the
rest of the notes&mdash;with the gold&mdash;and the
papers you took away from my room!&rdquo; rejoined
Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you'll never know more than this,&rdquo; 
retorted Blueskin, with a grin of satisfaction;&mdash; 
&ldquo;they're in a place of safety, where <it>you</it>'ll
never find 'em, but where somebody else <it>will</it>,
and that before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Hear me, Blueskin,&rdquo; said Jonathan, restraining
his choler. &ldquo;If you'll tell me where</pp>
<pb n="120">
<pp>to look for these things, and I <it>do</it> find them,
I'll set you free. And you shall have a share
of the gold for yourself.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you what I'll do,&rdquo; rejoined the
other. &ldquo;Set Captain Sheppard free, and when
I hear he's safe,&mdash;not before,&mdash;I'll put the
money and papers into your possession, and
some other matters, too, that you know nothing
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impracticable dolt!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan,
furiously. &ldquo;Do you think I'd part with the
sweetest morsel of revenge on those terms? No!
But I'll have the secret out of you by other
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he violently shut and locked the
door.</p>
<p><pp>About ten days after this interview, Blueskin,
having been indicted by Wild for
several robberies, and true bills found against
him, was placed at the bar of the Old
Bailey to be arraigned; when he declared that
he would not plead to the indictment, unless
the sum of five hundred pounds, taken
from him by Jonathan Wild, was first restored</pp>
<pb n="121">
<pp>to him. This sum, claimed by Wild under the
statute 4th and 5th of William and Mary,
entitled &ldquo;<it>An act for encouraging the apprehending
of Highwaymen</it>,&rdquo; was granted to him
by the court.</pp></p>
<p>As Blueskin still continued obstinate, the
judgment appointed to be executed upon such
prisoners as stood mute, was then read. It was
as follows, and, when uttered, produced a strong
effect upon all who heard it, except the prisoner,
who, in no respect, altered his sullen and dogged
demeanour.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar,&rdquo; thus ran the sentence,
&ldquo;you shall be taken to the prison from whence
you came, and put into a mean room, stopped
from the light; and shall there be laid on the
bare ground, without any litter, straw, or other
covering, and without any garment. You shall
lie upon your back; your head shall be covered; 
and your feet shall be bare. One of your arms
shall be drawn to one side of the room, and the
other arm to the other side; and your legs
shall be served in the like manner. Then, there
shall be laid upon your body as much iron, or</pp>
<pb n="122">
<pp>stone as you can bear, and more. And the
first day, you shall have three morsels of barley
bread, without any drink; and the second day,
you shall be allowed to drink as much as you
can, at three times, of the water that is next to
the prison&hyphen;door, except running&hyphen;water, without
any bread. And this shall be your diet till
you die.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar,&rdquo; continued the clerk
of the court, &ldquo;he against whom this judgment
is given, forfeits his goods to the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An awful silence prevailed throughout the
court. Every eye was fixed upon the prisoner.
But, as he made no answer, he was
removed.</p>
<p>Before the full sentence was carried into
execution, he was taken into a small room adjoining
the court. Here Marvel, the executioner,
who was in attendance, was commanded
by Wild to tie his thumbs together, which he
did with whipcord so tightly, that the string
cut to the bone. But, as this produced no
effect, and did not even elicit a groan, the prisoner
was carried back to Newgate.</p>
<pb n="123">
<p><pp>The Press Room, to which Blueskin was
conveyed on his arrival at the gaol, was a small
square chamber, walled and paved with stone.
In each corner stood a stout square post reaching
to the ceiling. To these a heavy wooden
apparatus was attached, which could be raised
or lowered at pleasure by pullies. In the floor
were set four ring&hyphen;bolts, about nine feet apart.
When the prisoner was brought into this room,
he was again questioned; but, continuing contumacious,
preparations were made for inflicting
the torture. His great personal strength
being so well known, it was deemed prudent
by Marvel to have all the four partners, together
with Caliban, in attendance. The prisoner,
however, submitted more quietly than
was anticipated. He allowed his irons and
clothes to be taken off without resistance. But
just as they were about to place him on the
ground, he burst from their hold, and made a
desperate spring at Jonathan, who was standing
with his arms folded near the door watching
the scene. The attempt was unsuccessful.
He was instantly overpowered, and stretched</pp>
<pb n="124">
<pp>upon the ground. The four men fell upon
him, holding his arms and legs, while Caliban
forced back his head. In this state, he contrived
to get the poor black's hand into his
mouth, and nearly bit off one of his fingers
before the sufferer could be rescued. Meanwhile,
the executioner had attached strong
cords to his ankles and wrists, and fastened
them tightly to the iron rings. This done, he
unloosed the pulley, and the ponderous machine,
which resembled a trough, slowly descended
upon the prisoner's breast. Marvel,
then, took two iron weights, each of a hundred
pounds, and placed them in the press. As this
seemed insufficient, after a lapse of five minutes,
he added another hundred weight. The
prisoner breathed with difficulty. Still, his
robust frame enabled him to hold out. After
he had endured this torture for an hour, at a
sign from Wild another hundred weight was
added. In a few minutes, an appalling change
was perceptible. The veins in his throat and
forehead swelled and blackened; his eyes protruded
from their sockets, and stared wildly; a</pp>
<pb n="125">
<pp>thick damp gathered on his brow; and blood
gushed from his mouth, nostrils, and ears.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>The executioner shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you submit?&rdquo; interrogated Wild.</p>
<p>Blueskin answered by dashing his head violently
against the flagged floor. His efforts at
self&hyphen;destruction were, however, prevented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try fifty pounds more,&rdquo; said Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; groaned Blueskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you plead?&rdquo;demanded Wild, harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release him,&rdquo; said Jonathan. &ldquo;We have
cured his obstinacy, you perceive,&rdquo; he added to
Marvel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <it>will</it> live,&rdquo; cried Blueskin, with a look of
the deadliest hatred at Wild, &ldquo;to be revenged
on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as the weights were removed, he fainted.</p></div4>

<subhead>HOW JACK SHEPPARD'S PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED.</subhead> <attbytes>29Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030665</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard.

<p><smallcap>Early</smallcap> in the morning of Thursday, the 15th
of October, 1724, the door of the Castle was
opened by Austin, who, with a look of unusual
importance, announced to the prisoner
that four gentlemen were shortly coming up
with the governor to see him,&mdash;&ldquo;four <it>such</it>
gentlemen,&rdquo; he added, in a tone meant to impress
his auditor with a due sense of the honour
intended him, &ldquo;as you don't meet every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Wood among them?&rdquo; asked Jack,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.Wood!&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied the turnkey.
&ldquo;Do you think I'd take the trouble to announce
<it>him</it>? These are persons of consequence,
I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="127">
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; inquired Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, first,&rdquo; rejoined Austin, &ldquo;there's Sir
James Thornhill, historical painter to his Majesty,
and the greatest artist of the day. Those
grand designs in the dome of St. Paul's are his
work. So is the roof of the state&hyphen;room at
Hampton Court Palace, occupied by Queen
Anne, and the Prince of Denmark. So is the
chapel of All Souls at Oxford, and the great
hall at Blenheim, and I don't know how many
halls and chapels besides. He's now engaged
on the hall at Greenwich Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've heard of him,&rdquo; replied Jack, impatiently.
&ldquo;Who are the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see. There's a friend of Sir
James&mdash;a young man, an engraver of masquerade
tickets and caricatures,&mdash;his name I
believe is Hogarth. Then, there's Mr. Gay,
the poet, who wrote the &lsquo;Captives,&rsquo; which was
lately acted at Drury Lane, and was so much
admired by the Princess of Wales. And,
lastly, there's Mr. Figg, the noted prize&hyphen;fighter,
from the New Amphitheatre in Marylebone
Fields.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="128">
<p>&ldquo;Figg's an old friend of mine,&rdquo; rejoined
Jack; &ldquo;he was my instructor in the small
sword and back sword exercise. I'm glad he's
come to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't inquire what brings Sir James
Thornhill here?&rdquo; said Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curiosity, I suppose,&rdquo; returned Jack, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; rejoined the gaoler; &ldquo;he's
coming on business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what business, in the name of wonder?&rdquo; 
asked Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To paint you portrait,&rdquo; answered the
gaoler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My portrait!&rdquo; echoed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By desire of his Majesty,&rdquo; said the gaoler,
consequentially. &ldquo;He has heard of your wonderful
escapes, and wishes to see what you're
like. There's a feather in your cap! No
housebreaker was ever so highly honoured before.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;And have my escapes really made so much
noise as to reach the ear of royalty?&rdquo; mused</pp>
<pb n="129">
<pp>Jack. &ldquo;I have done nothing&mdash;nothing to
what I <it>could</it> do&mdash;to what I <it>will</it> do!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You've done quite enough,&rdquo; rejoined Austin; 
&ldquo;more than you'll ever do again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then to be taken thus, in these disgraceful
bonds!&rdquo;continued Jack, &ldquo;to be held
up as a sight for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how else would you be taken?&rdquo; exclaimed
the gaoler, with a coarse laugh. &ldquo;It's
very well Mr. Wild allowed you to have your
fine clothes again, or you might have been
taken in a still more disgraceful garb. For
my part, I think those shackles extremely becoming.
But, here they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Voices being heard at the door, Austin flew
to open it, and admitted Mr. Pitt, the governor,
a tall pompous personage, who, in his
turn, ushered in four other individuals. The
first of these, whom he addressed as Mr. Gay,
was a stout, good&hyphen;looking, good&hyphen;humoured
man, about thirty&hyphen;six, with a dark complexion,
an oval face, fine black eyes, full of fire and
sensibility, and twinkling with roguish humour</pp>
<pb n="130">
<pp>&mdash;an expression fully borne out by the
mouth, which had a very shrewd and sarcastic
curl. The poet's appearance altogether was
highly prepossessing. With a strong tendency
to satire, but without a particle of malice or
ill&hyphen;nature in its display, Gay, by his strokes
of pleasantry, whether in his writings or conversation,
never lost a friend. On the contrary,
he was a universal favourite, and numbered
amongst his intimate acquaintances the
choicest spirits of the time,&mdash;Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot,
and &ldquo;all the better brothers.&rdquo; His
demeanour was polished; his manners singularly
affable and gentle; and he was remarkable
for the generosity of his temper. In
worldly matters Gay was not fortunate. Possessed,
at one time, of a share in the South Sea
stock, he conceived himself worth twenty thousand
pounds. But, on the bursting of that
bubble, his hopes vanished with it. Neither
did his interest,&mdash;which was by no means inconsiderable,
&mdash;nor his general popularity, procure
him the preferment he desired. A constant
attendant at court, he had the mortification</pp>
<pb n="131">
<pp>to see every one promoted but himself,
and thus bewails his ill&hyphen;luck.
<lb><lg><l>Places, I found, were daily given away,</l>
<l>And yet no friendly gazette mentioned Gay.</l></lg>
<lb>The prodigious success of the &ldquo;Beggars'
Opera,&rdquo; which was produced about four years
after the date of this history, rewarded him for
all his previous disappointments, though it did
not fully justify the well&hyphen;known epigram, alluding
to himself and the manager, and &ldquo;make
Gay <it>rich</it>, and Rich <it>gay.</it>&rdquo; At the time of
his
present introduction, his play of &ldquo;The Captives,&rdquo; 
had just been produced at Drury Lane,
and he was meditating his &ldquo;Fables,&rdquo; which
were published two years afterwards.</pp></p>
<p><pp>Behind the poet came Sir James Thornhill.
The eminent painter had handsome, expressive
features, an aquiline nose, and a good deal of
dignity in his manner. His age was not far
from fifty. He was accompanied by a young
man of about seven&hyphen;and&hyphen;twenty, who carried
his easel, set it in its place, laid the canvass
upon it, opened the paint box, took out the</pp>
<pb n="132">
<pp>brushes and palette, and, in short, paid him
the most assiduous attention. This young
man, whose features, though rather plain and
coarse, bore the strongest impress of genius,
and who had a dark grey, penetrating eye, so
quick in its glances that it seemed to survey
twenty objects at once, and yet only to fasten
upon one, bore the honoured name of William
Hogarth. Why he paid so much attention
to Sir James Thornhill may be explained
anon.</pp></p>
<p><pp>The rear of the party was brought up by a
large, powerfully&hyphen;built man, with a bluff, honest,
but rugged countenance, slashed with
many a cut and scar, and stamped with that
surly, sturdy, bull&hyphen;dog&hyphen;like look, which an
Englishman always delights to contemplate,
because he conceives it to be characteristic of
his countrymen. This formidable person, who
was no other than the renowned Figg, the
&ldquo;Atlas of the sword,&rdquo; as he is termed by Captain
Godfrey, had removed his hat and &ldquo;skull
covering,&rdquo; and was wiping the heat from his
bepatched and close&hyphen;shaven pate. His shirt</pp>
<pb n="133">
<pp>also was unbuttoned, and disclosed a neck like
that of an ox, and a chest which might have
served as a model for a Hercules. He had a
flattish, perhaps, it should be called, a <it>flattened</it>
nose, and a brown, leathern&hyphen;looking hide, that
seemed as if it had not unfrequently undergone
the process of tanning. Under his arm he
carried a thick, knotted crab&hyphen;stick. The above
description of
<lb><lg><l>&mdash;the great Figg, by the prize&hyphen;fighting swains</l>
<l>Sole monarch acknowledged of Mary'bone plains&mdash;</l></lg>
<lb>may sound somewhat tame by the side of the
glowing account given of him by his gallant
biographer, who asserts that &ldquo;there was a majesty
shone in his countenance, and blazed in
his actions, beyond all I ever saw;&rdquo; but it
may, possibly, convey a more accurate notion
of his personal appearance. James Figg was
the most perfect master of self&hyphen;defence of his
day. Seconded by his strength and temper,
his skill rendered him invincible, and he is
reputed never to have lost a battle. His imperturbable
demeanour in the fight has been</pp>
<pb n="134">
<pp>well portrayed by Captain Godfrey, who here
condescends to lay aside his stilts. &ldquo;His right
leg bold and firm, and his left, which could
hardly ever be disturbed, gave him a surprising
advantage, and struck his adversary
with despair and panic. He had a peculiar
way of stepping in, in a parry; knew his arm,
and its just time of moving; put a firm faith
in that, and never let his opponent escape.
He was just as much a greater master than any
other I ever saw, as he was a greater judge of
time and measure.&rdquo; Figg's prowess in a combat
with Sutton has been celebrated by Dr.
Byrom,&mdash;a poet of whom his native town,
Manchester, may be justly proud; and his
features and figure have been preserved by
the most illustrious of his companions on the
present occasion,&mdash;Hogarth,&mdash;in the lev&eacute;e in
the &ldquo;Rake's Progress,&rdquo; and in &ldquo;Southwark
Fair.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>On the appearance of his visiters, Sheppard
arose,&mdash;his gyves clanking heavily as he made
the movement,&mdash;and folding his arms, so far
as his manacles would permit him, upon his</pp>
<pb n="135">
<pp>breast, steadily returned the glances fixed upon
him.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the noted house&hyphen;breaker and prison&hyphen;breaker,
gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Pitt, pointing to
the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd's life!&rdquo; cried Gay, in astonishment; 
&ldquo;is this slight&hyphen;made stripling Jack Sheppard?
Why, I expected to see a man six foot high at
the least, and as broad across the shoulders as
our friend Figg. This is a mere boy. Are
you sure you haven't mistaken the ward, Mr.
Pitt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no mistake, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the
prisoner, drawing himself up. &ldquo;I am Jack
Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never was more surprised in my
life,&rdquo; said the poet,&mdash;&ldquo;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;He's just the man <it>I</it> expected to see,&rdquo; observed
Hogarth, who, having arranged everything
to Thornhill's satisfaction, had turned to
look at the prisoner, and was now, with his
chin upon his wrist, and his elbow supported
by the other hand, bending his keen grey eyes
upon him, &ldquo;just the man! Look at that</pp>
<pb n="136">
<pp>light, lithe figure,&mdash;all muscle and activity,
with not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon it.
In my search after strange characters, Mr.
Gay, I've been in many odd quarters of our
city&mdash;have visited haunts frequented only by
thieves&mdash;the Old Mint, the New Mint, the
worst part of St. Giles's, and other places&mdash; 
but I've nowhere seen any one who came up
so completely to my notion of a first&hyphen;rate
house&hyphen;breaker as the individual before us.
Wherever I saw him, I should pick him out as
a man designed by nature to plan and accomplish
the wonderful escapes he has effected.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>As he spoke, a smile crossed Sheppard's
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He understands me, you perceive,&rdquo; said
Hogarth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won't dispute your judgment in
such matters, Mr. Hogarth,&rdquo; replied Gay.
&ldquo;But I appeal to you, Sir James, whether it
isn't extraordinary that so very slight a person
should be such a desperate robber as he is represented
&mdash;so young, too, for such an <it>old</it>
offender. Why, he can scarcely be twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="137">
<p>&ldquo;I am one&hyphen;and&hyphen;twenty,&rdquo; observed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&hyphen;and&hyphen;twenty, ah!&rdquo; repeated Gay.
&ldquo;Well, I'm not far from the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly extremely youthful&hyphen;looking
and very slightly made,&rdquo; said Thornhill,
who had been attentively studying Sheppard's
countenance. &ldquo;But I agree with Hogarth,
that he is precisely the person to do what he
has done. Like a thorough&hyphen;bred racer, he
would sustain twice as much fatigue as a person
of heavier mould. Can I be accommodated
with a seat, Mr. Pitt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Sir James, certainly,&rdquo; replied
the governor. &ldquo;Get a chair, Austin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this order was obeyed, Figg, who had
been standing near the door, made his way to
the prisoner, and offered him his huge hand,
which Jack warmly grasped.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Well, Jack,&rdquo; said the prize&hyphen;fighter, in a
rough, but friendly voice, and with a cut&hyphen;and&hyphen;thrust
abrupt manner peculiar to himself; 
&ldquo;how are you, lad, eh? Sorry to see you
here. Wouldn't take my advice. Told you
how it would be. One mistress enough to ruin</pp>
<pb n="138">
<pp>a man,&mdash;two, the devil. Laughed at me, then.
Laugh on the wrong side of your mouth,
now.'</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You're not come here to insult me, Mr.
Figg?&rdquo; said Jack, peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insult you! not I;&rdquo; returned Figg.
&ldquo;Heard of your escapes. Everybody talking
of you. Wished to see you. Old pupil.
Capital swordsman. Shortly to be executed.
Come to take leave. Trifle useful?&rdquo; he
added, slipping a few gold pieces into Jack's
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Jack, returning
the money; &ldquo;but I don't require assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too proud, eh?&rdquo; rejoined the prizefighter.
&ldquo;Won't be under an obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you're wrong, Mr. Figg,&rdquo; replied
Jack, smiling; &ldquo;for, before I'm taken to Tyburn,
I mean to borrow a shirt for the occasion
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it, and welcome,&rdquo; rejoined Figg.
&ldquo;Always plenty to spare. Never bought a
shirt in my life, Mr. Gay,&rdquo; he added, turning
to the poet. &ldquo;Sold a good many, though.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="139">
<p>&ldquo;How do you manage that, Mr. Figg?&rdquo; 
asked Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; replied the prize&hyphen;fighter. &ldquo;Proclaim
a public fight. Challenge accepted.
Fifty pupils. Day before, send round to each
to borrow a shirt. Fifty sent home. All
superfine holland. Wear one on the stage on
the following day. Cut to pieces&mdash;slashed&mdash; 
bloodied. Each of my scholars thinks it his
own shirt. Offer to return it to each in
private. All make the same answer&mdash; &lsquo;d&wblank;n
you, keep it.&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ingenious device,&rdquo; laughed Gay.</p>
<p>Sir James Thornhill's preparations being
completed, Mr. Pitt desired to know if he
wanted anything further, and being answered
in the negative, he excused himself on the plea
that his attendance was required in the court
at the Old Bailey, which was then sitting, and
withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do me the favour to seat yourself, Jack?&rdquo; 
said Sir James. &ldquo;Gentlemen, a little further
off, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Sheppard immediately complied with the</pp>
<pb n="140">
<pp>painter's request; while Gay and Figg drew
back on one side, and Hogarth on the other.
The latter took from his pocket a small notebook
and pencil.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll make a sketch, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Jack
Sheppard's face is well worth preserving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After narrowly examining the countenance
of the sitter, and motioning him with his pencil
into a particular attitude, Sir James Thornhill
commenced operations; and, while he rapidly
transferred his lineaments to the canvass, engaged
him in conversation, in the course of
which he artfully contrived to draw him into a
recital of his adventures. The <it>ruse</it> succeeded
almost beyond his expectation. During the
narration Jack's features lighted up, and an
expression, which would have been in vain
looked for in repose, was instantly caught and
depicted by the skilful artist. All the party
were greatly interested by Sheppard's history
&mdash;especially Figg, who laughed loud and long
at the escape from the Condemned Hold.
When Jack came to speak of Jonathan Wild,
his countenance fell.</p>
<pb n="141">
<p>&ldquo;We must change the subject,&rdquo; remarked
Thornhill, pausing in his task; &ldquo;this will
never do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Sir James,&rdquo; said &hyphen;Austin.
&ldquo;We never suffer him to mention Mr. Wild's
name. He never appears to so little advantage
as when speaking of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't wonder at it,&rdquo; rejoined Gay.</p>
<p>Here Hogarth received a private signal from
Thornhill to attract Sheppard's attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you've given up all hope of
escaping, eh, Jack?&rdquo; remarked Hogarth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's scarcely a fair question, Mr.
Hogarth, before the gaoler,&rdquo; replied Jack.
&ldquo;But I tell you frankly, and Mr. Austin may
repeat it if he pleases to his master, Jonathan
Wild,&mdash;I have <it>not.</it>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, Jack,&rdquo; cried Figg. &ldquo;Never
give in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Hogarth, &ldquo;if, fettered
as you are, you contrive to break out of this
dungeon, you'll do what no man ever did before.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>A peculiar smile illuminated Jack's features.</pp>
<pb n="142">
<pp>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; cried Sir James, eagerly.
&ldquo;There's the exact expression I want. For
the love of Heaven, Jack, don't move!&mdash;Don't
alter a muscle, if you can help it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>And, with a few magical touches, he stamped
the fleeting expression on the canvass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it too!&rdquo; exclaimed Hogarth, busily
plying his pencil. &ldquo;Gad! it's a devilish fine
face when lit up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As like as life, sir,&rdquo; observed Austin,
peeping over Thornhill's shoulder at the portrait.
&ldquo;As like as life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very face,&rdquo; exclaimed Gay, advancing
to look at it;&mdash;&ldquo;with all the escapes written
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; smiled Sir James. &ldquo;But,
I own, I think it <it>is</it> like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of <it>my</it> sketch, Jack?&rdquo; 
said Hogarth, handing him the drawing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's like enough, I dare say,&rdquo; rejoined
Sheppard. &ldquo;But it wants something <it>here.</it>&rdquo; 
And he pointed significantly to the hand.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; rejoined Hogarth, rapidly sketching
a file, which he placed in the hands of the</pp>
<pb n="143">
<pp>picture. &ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo; he added, returning
it.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;It's better,&rdquo; observed Sheppard, meaningly.
&ldquo;But you've given me what I don't
possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Hogarth, looking fixedly at
him. &ldquo;I don't see how I can improve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I look at it, sir?&rdquo; said Austin, stepping
towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hogarth, hastily effacing the
sketch. &ldquo;I'm never satisfied with a first attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad, Jack,&rdquo; said Gay, &ldquo;you should
write your adventures. They would be quite
as entertaining as the histories of Guzman
D'Alfarache, Lazarillo de Tormes, Estevanillo
Gonzalez, Meriton Latroon, or any of my
favourite rouges,&mdash;and far more instructive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better write them for me, Mr.
Gay,&rdquo; rejoined Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you'll write them, I'll illustrate them,&rdquo; 
observed Hogarth.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;An idea has just occurred to me,&rdquo; said
Gay, &ldquo;which Jack's narrative has suggested.</pp>
<pb n="144">
<pp>I'll write an opera, the scene of which shall be
laid altogether in Newgate, and the principal
character shall be a highwayman. I'll not
forget your two mistresses, Jack.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor Jonathan Wild, I hope,&rdquo; interposed
Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Gay. &ldquo;I'll gibbet
the rascal. But I forget,&rdquo; he added, glancing
at Austin; &ldquo;it's high treason to speak disrespectfully
of Mr. Wild in his own domain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear nothing, sir,&rdquo; laughed Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to add,&rdquo; continued Gay,
&ldquo;that my opera shall have no music except the
good old ballad tunes. And we'll see whether
it won't put the Italian opera out of fashion,
with Cutzoni, Senesino, and the &lsquo;divine&rsquo; Farinelli
at its head.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You'll do a national service, then,&rdquo; said
Hogarth. &ldquo;The sums lavished upon those
people are perfectly disgraceful, and I should
be enchanted to see them hooted from the
stage. But I've an idea as well as you,
grounded in some measure upon Sheppard's
story. I'll take two apprentices, and depict</pp>
<pb n="145">
<pp>their career. One, by perseverance and industry
shall obtain fortune, credit, and the
highest honours; while the other by an opposite
course, and dissolute habits, shall eventually
arrive at Tyburn.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your's will be nearer the truth, and have
a deeper moral, Mr. Hogarth,&rdquo; remarked Jack,
dejectedly. &ldquo;But if my career were truly exhibited,
it must be as one long struggle against
destiny in the shape of&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Jonathan Wild,&rdquo; interposed Gay. &ldquo;I
knew it. By the by, Mr. Hogarth, didn't I
see you last night at the ridotto with Lady
Thornhill and her pretty daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&mdash;no, sir,&rdquo; stammered Hogarth,
colouring. And he hazarded a wink at the
poet over the paper on which he was sketching.
Luckily, Sir James was so much engrossed by
his own task, that both the remark and gesture
escaped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I was mistaken,&rdquo; returned Gay.
&ldquo;You've been quizzing my friend Kent, I
perceive, in your Burlington Gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;A capital caricature that,&rdquo; remarked</pp>
<pb n="146">
<pp>Thornhill, laughing. &ldquo;What does Mr. Kent
say to it?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks so highly of it, that he says if
he had a daughter he would give her to the
artist,&rdquo; answered Gay, a little maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Sdeath!&rdquo; cried Hogarth, aside to the
poet. &ldquo;You've ruined my hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advanced them rather,&rdquo; replied Gay, in
the same tone. &ldquo;Miss Thornhill's a charming
girl. <it>I</it> think a wife a needless incumbrance,
and mean to die a bachelor.
But, if I were in your place, I know what
I'd do&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;What&mdash;what would you do?&rdquo; asked
Hogarth, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away with her,&rdquo; replied Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; exclaimed Hogarth. But he afterwards
acted upon the suggestion.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Good b'ye, Jack,&rdquo; said Figg, putting on
his hat. &ldquo;Rather in the way. Send you the
shirt. Here, turnkey. Couple of guineas to
drink Captain Sheppard's speedy escape.
Thank him, not me, man. Give this fellow</pp>
<pb n="147">
<pp>the slip, if you can, Jack. If not, keep up
your spirits. Die game.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;If I get
free, I'll have a bout with you at all weapons.
If not, I'll take a cheerful glass with
you at the City of Oxford, on my way to
Tyburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give you the best I have in either case,&rdquo; 
replied Figg. Good&hyphen;b'ye!&rdquo; And with a
cordial shake of the hand he took his departure.</p>
<p>Sir James Thornhill, then, rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't trouble you further, Jack,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;I've done all I can to the portrait
here. I must finish it at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to see it, Sir James?&rdquo; requested
Jack. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he painting
was turned towards him. &ldquo;What would
my poor mother say to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry to see that about your mother,
Jack,&rdquo; observed Hogarth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of her?&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, starting
up. &ldquo;Is she dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; answered Hogarth. &ldquo;Don't</pp>
<pb n="148">
<pp>alarm yourself. I saw it this morning in the
Daily Journal&mdash;an advertisement, offering a
reward&wblank;&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;A reward!&rdquo; echoed Jack. &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the paper with me. 'Sdeath! what
can I have done with it? Oh! here it is,&rdquo; 
cried Hogarth, picking it from the ground.
&ldquo;I must have dropped it when I took out my
note&hyphen;book. There's the paragraph. &ldquo;<it>Mrs.
Sheppard left Mr. Wood's house at Dollis Hill
on Tuesday</it>'&mdash;that's two days ago,&mdash; &lsquo;<it>hasn't
been heard of since.</it>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; cried Jack, snatching the
paper, and eagerly perusing the advertisement.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a tone of anguish.
&ldquo;She has fallen into the villain's hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What villain?&rdquo; cried Hogarth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan Wild, I'll be sworn,&rdquo; said Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&mdash;right!&rdquo; cried Jack, striking his
fettered hands against his breast. &ldquo;She is in
his power, and I am here, chained hand and
foot, unable to assist her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could make a fine sketch of him now,&rdquo; 
whispered Hogarth to Gay.</p>
<pb n="149">
<p>&ldquo;I told you how it was, Sir James,&rdquo; said
Austin, addressing the knight, who was preparing
for his departure, &ldquo;he attributes every
misfortune that befals him to Mr. Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with some justice,&rdquo; replied Thornhill,
drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to assist you, Sir James,&rdquo; said
Hogarth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks, sir,&rdquo; replied Thornhill, with
freezing politeness; &ldquo;but I do not require
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, Jack,&rdquo; said Gay, &ldquo;I've
several urgent engagements this morning; but
I'll return to&hyphen;morrow, and hear the rest of your
story. And, if I can render you any service,
you may command me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To&hyphen;morrow will be too late,&rdquo; said Sheppard,
moodily.</p>
<p>The easel and palette having been packed
up, and the canvass carefully removed by
Austin, the party took leave of the prisoner,
who was so much abstracted that he scarcely
noticed their departure. Just as Hogarth got
to the door, the turnkey stopped him.</p>
<pb n="150">
<p>&ldquo;You have forgotten your knife, Mr. Hogarth,&rdquo; 
he observed, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have,&rdquo; replied Hogarth, glancing at
Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do without it,&rdquo; muttered Jack.</p>
<p>The door was then locked, and he was left
alone.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, on the same day, Austin
brought up Jack's provisions, and, after carefully
examining his fetters, and finding all
secure, told him if he wanted anything further
he must mention it, as he should not be able to
return in the evening, his presence being required
elsewhere. Jack replied in the negative,
and it required all his mastery over himself
to prevent the satisfaction which this announcement
afforded him from being noticed
by the gaoler.</p>
<p>With the usual precautions, Austin then departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried Jack, leaping up, &ldquo;for
an achievement, compared with which all I
have yet done shall be as nothing!&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Jack Sheppard's</smallcap> first object was to free himself
from his handcuffs. This he accomplished
by holding the chain that connected them
firmly between his teeth, and squeezing his
fingers as closely together as possible, succeeded
in drawing his wrists through the
manacles. He next twisted the heavy gyves
round and round, and partly by main strength,
partly by a dexterous and well&hyphen;applied jerk,
snapped asunder the central link by which
they were attached to the padlock. Taking off
his stockings, he then drew up the basils as far
as he was able, and tied the fragments of the
broken chain to his legs, to prevent them from
clanking, and impeding his future exertions.</p>
<pb n="152">
<p>Jack's former attempt to pass up the
chimney, it may be remembered, was obstructed
by an iron bar. To remove this
obstacle it was necessary to make an extensive
breach in the wall. With the broken
links of the chain, which served him in lieu
of more efficient implements, he commenced
operations just above the chimney&hyphen;piece, and
soon contrived to pick a hole in the plaster.</p>
<p>He found the wall, as he suspected, solidly
constructed of brick and stone; and with the
slight and inadequate tools which he possessed,
it was a work of infinite labour and
skill to get out a single brick. That done,
however, he was well aware the rest would
be comparatively easy, and as he threw the
brick to the ground, he exclaimed triumphantly,
&ldquo;The first step is taken&mdash;the main
difficulty is overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Animated by this trifling success, he proceeded
with fresh ardour, and the rapidity
of his progress was proclaimed by the heap
of bricks, stones, and mortar which before
long covered the floor. At the expiration of</pp>
<pb n="153">
<pp>an hour, by dint of unremitting exertion, he
had made so large a breach in the chimney,
that he could stand upright in it. He was
now within a foot of the bar, and introducing
himself into the hole, speedily worked
his way to it.</pp></p>
<p>Regardless of the risk he incurred from
some heavy stone dropping on his head or
feet,&mdash;regardless also of the noise made by
the falling rubbish, and of the imminent danger
which he consequently ran of being interrupted
by some of the gaolers, should the
sound reach their ears, he continued to pull
down large masses of the wall, which he flung
upon the floor of the cell.</p>
<p><pp>Having worked thus for another quarter of
an hour without being sensible of fatigue,
though he was half stifled by the clouds of
dust which his exertions raised, he had made
a hole about three feet wide, and six high,
and uncovered the iron bar. Grasping it
firmly with both hands, he quickly wrenched
it from the stones in which it was mortised,
and leapt to the ground. On examination</pp>
<pb n="154">
<pp>it proved to be a flat bar of iron, nearly
a yard in length, and more than an inch
square. &ldquo;A capital instrument for my purpose,&rdquo; 
thought Jack, shouldering it, &ldquo;and
worth all the trouble I have had in procuring
it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>While he was thus musing, he fancied he
heard the lock tried. A chill ran through
his frame, and, grasping the heavy weapon
with which chance had provided him, prepared
to strike down the first person who
should enter the cell. After listening attentively
for a short time without drawing
breath, he became convinced that his apprehensions
were groundless, and, greatly relieved,
sat down upon the chair to rest himself
and prepare for further efforts.</p>
<p>Acquainted with every part of the gaol,
Jack well knew that his only chance of effecting
an escape must be by the roof. To reach
it would be a most difficult undertaking.
Still it <it>was</it> possible, and the difficulty was
only a fresh incitement.</p>
<p><pp>The mere enumeration of the obstacles that</pp>
<pb n="155">
<pp>existed would have deterred any spirit less
daring than Sheppard's from even hazarding
the attempt. Independently of other risks,
and of the chance of breaking his neck in
the descent, he was aware that to reach the
leads he should have to break open six of
the strongest doors of the prison. Armed,
however, with the implement he had so fortunately
obtained, he did not despair of success.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;My name will only be remembered as
that of a robber,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;but it shall
be remembered as that of a bold one: and
this night's achievement, if it does nothing
else, shall prevent me from being classed with
the common herd of depredators.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Roused by this reflection, filled with the
deepest anxiety for his mother, and burning
to be avenged upon Jonathan Wild, he grasped
the iron bar, which, when he sat down, he had
laid upon his knees, and stepped quickly across
the room. In doing so, he had to clamber
up the immense heap of bricks and rubbish
which now littered the floor, amounting almost</pp>
<pb n="156">
<pp>to a cartload, and reaching up nearly to the
top of the chimney&hyphen;piece.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Austin will stare,&rdquo; thought Jack, &ldquo;when
he comes here in the morning. It will cost
them something to repair their stronghold, and
take them more time to build it up again than
I have taken to pull it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before proceeding with his task, he considered
whether it would be possible to barricade
the door; but, reflecting that the bar
would be an indispensable assistant in his
further efforts, he abandoned the idea, and
determined to rely implicitly on that good
fortune which had hitherto attended him on
similar occasions.</p>
<p>Having once more got into the chimney, he
climbed to a level with the ward above, and
recommenced operations as vigorously as before.
He was now aided with a powerful
implement, with which he soon contrived to
make a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every brick I take out,&rdquo; cried Jack, as
fresh rubbish clattered down the chimney,
&ldquo;brings me nearer my mother.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>The</smallcap> ward into which Jack was endeavouring
to break was called the Red Room, from the
circumstance of its walls having once been
painted in that colour; all traces of which had,
however, long since disappeared. Like the
Castle, which it resembled in all respects except
that it was destitute even of a barrack&hyphen;bedstead,
the Red Room was reserved for state&hyphen;prisoners,
and had not been occupied since the year 1716,
when the gaol, as has before been mentioned,
was crowded by the Preston rebels.</p>
<p><pp>Having made a hole in the wall sufficiently
large to pass through, Jack first tossed the
bar into the room, and then crept after it.
As soon as he had gained his feet, he glanced</pp>
<pb n="158">
<pp>round the bare blank walls of the cell, and,
oppressed by the musty, close atmosphere, exclaimed,
&ldquo;I'll let a little fresh air into this
dungeon. They say it hasn't been opened for
eight years&mdash;but I won't be eight years in
getting out of it.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>In stepping across the room, some sharp
point in the floor pierced his foot, and stooping
to examine it, he found that the wound had
been inflicted by a long rusty nail, which projected
from the boards. Totally disregarding
the pain, he picked up the nail, and reserved
it for future use. Nor was he long in making
it available.</p>
<p>On examining the door, he found it secured
by a large rusty lock, which he endeavoured to
pick with the nail he had just acquired; but
all his efforts proving ineffectual, he removed
the plate that covered it with the bar, and with
his fingers contrived to draw back the bolt.</p>
<p><pp>Opening the door he then stepped into a
dark narrow passage, 0leading, as he was well
aware, to the chapel. On the left there were
doors communicating with the King's Bench</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>297Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010124">
<pb n="159">
<pp>Ward and the Stone Ward, two large holds
on the Master Debtors' side. But Jack was
too well versed in the geography of the place
to attempt either of them. Indeed, if he had
been ignorant of it, the sound of voices which
he could faintly distinguish, would have served
as a caution to him.</pp></p>
<p>Hurrying on, his progress was soon checked
by a strong door, several inches in thickness,
and nearly as wide as the passage. Running
his hand carefully over it in search of the lock,
he perceived to his dismay that it was fastened
on the other side. After several vain attempts
to burst it open, he resolved, as a last alternative,
to break through the wall in the part
nearest to the lock. This was a much more
serious task than he anticipated. The wall
was of considerable thickness, and built altogether
of stone; and the noise he was compelled
to make in using the heavy bar, which
brought sparks with every splinter he struck
off, was so great, that he feared it must be
heard by the prisoners on the Debtors' side.
Heedless, however, of the consequences, he
pursued his task.</p>
<pb n="160">
<p>Half an hour's labour, during which he was
obliged more than once to pause to regain
breath, sufficed to make a hole wide enough to
allow a passage for his arm up to the elbow.
In this way he was able to force back a ponderous
bolt from its socket; and, to his unspeakable
joy, found that the door instantly yielded.</p>
<p>Once more cheered by daylight, he hastened
forward, and entered the chapel.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Situated</smallcap> at the upper part of the south&hyphen;east
angle of the gaol, the chapel of Old Newgate
was divided on the north side into three
grated compartments, or pens as they were
termed, allotted to the common debtors, and
felons. In the north&hyphen;west angle, there was
a small pen for female offenders, and, on the
south, a more commodious inclosure appropriated
to the master&hyphen;debtors and strangers.
Immediately beneath the pulpit stood a large
circular pew where malefactors under sentence
of death sat to hear the condemned sermon delivered
to them, and where they formed a public
spectacle to the crowds, which curiosity
generally attracted on those occasions.</p>
<pb n="162">
<p>To return. Jack had got into one of the pens
at the north side of the chapel. The enclosure
by which it was surrounded was about twelve
feet high; the under part being composed of
oaken planks, the upper of a strong iron grating,
surmounted by sharp iron spikes. In the middle
there was a gate. It was locked. But Jack
speedily burst it open with the iron bar.</p>
<p><pp>Clearing the few impediments in his way,
he soon reached the condemned pew, where it
had once been his fate to sit; and extending
himself on the seat endeavoured to snatch a
moment's repose. It was denied him, for as he
closed his eyes&mdash;though but for an instant&mdash; 
the whole scene of his former visit to the place
rose before him. There he sat as before, with
the heavy fetters on his limbs, and beside him
sat his three companions, who had since expiated
their offences on the gibbet. The chapel
was again crowded with visiters, and every eye
&mdash;even that of Jonathan Wild who had come
thither to deride him,&mdash;was fixed upon him.
So perfect was the illusion, that he could
almost fancy he heard the solemn voice of the</pp>
<pb n="163">
<pp>ordinary warning him that his race was nearly
run, and imploring him to prepare for eternity.
From this perturbed state he was roused by
thoughts of his mother, and fancying he heard
her gentle voice urging him on to fresh exertion,
he started up.</pp></p>
<p>On one side of the chapel there was a large
grated window, but, as it looked upon the
interior of the gaol, Jack preferred following
the course he had originally decided upon to
making any attempt in this quarter.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he proceeded to a gate which
stood upon the south, and guarded the passage
communicating with the leads. It was grated
and crested with spikes, like that he had just
burst open, and thinking it a needless waste of
time to force it, he broke off one of the spikes,
which he carried with him for further purposes,
and then climbed over it.</p>
<p><pp>A short flight of steps brought him to a
dark passage, into which he plunged. Here he
found another strong door, making the fifth
he had encountered. Well aware that the
doors in this passage were much stronger than</pp>
<pb n="164">
<pp>those in the entry he had just quitted he
was neither surprised nor dismayed to find
it fastened by a lock of unusual size. After
repeatedly trying to remove the plate, which
was so firmly screwed down that it resisted
all his efforts, and vainly attempting to pick it
with the spike and nail; he, at length, after
half an hour's ineffectual labour, wrenched off
the box by means of the iron bar, and the
door, as he laughingly expressed it, &ldquo;became
his humble servant.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p><pp>But this difficulty was only overcome to be
succeeded by one still greater. Hastening
along the passage he came to the sixth door.
For this he was prepared; but he was not prepared
for the almost insurmountable obstacles
which it presented. Running his hand hastily
over it, he was startled to find it one complicated
mass of bolts and bars. It seemed
as if all the precautions previously taken were
here accumulated. Any one less courageous
than himself would have abandoned the attempt
from a conviction of its utter hopelessness; 
but, though it might for a moment</pp>
<pb n="165">
<pp>damp his ardour, it could not deter
him.</pp></p>
<p>Once again, he passed his hand over the
surface and carefully noted all the obstacles.
There was a lock, apparently more than a
foot wide, strongly plated, and girded to the
door with thick iron hoops. Below it a prodigiously
large bolt was shot into the socket,
and, in order to keep it there, was fastened
by a hasp, and further protected by an
immense padlock. Besides this, the door was
crossed and recrossed by iron bars, clenched
by broad&hyphen;headed nails. An iron fillet secured
the socket of the bolt and the box of the lock
to the main post of the doorway.</p>
<p>Nothing disheartened by this survey, Jack
set to work upon the lock, which he attacked
with all his implements;&mdash;now attempting to
pick it with the nail;&mdash;now to wrench it off
with the bar: but all without effect. He not
only failed in making any impression, but
seemed to increase the difficulties, for after an
hour's toil he had broken the nail and slightly
bent the iron bar.</p>
<pb n="166">
<p>Completely overcome by fatigue, with
strained muscles, and bruised hands; streaming
with perspiration, and with lips so parched
that he would gladly have parted with a
treasure if he had possessed it for a draught
of water; he sank against the wall, and while
in this state was seized with a sudden and
strange alarm. He fancied that the turnkeys
had discovered his flight and were in pursuit
of him,&mdash;that they had climbed up the
chimney,&mdash;entered the Red Room,&mdash;tracked
him from door to door, and were now only
detained by the gate which he had left unbroken
in the chapel. He even thought he
could detect the voice of Jonathan, urging
and directing them.</p>
<p>So strongly was he impressed with this
idea, that grasping the iron bar with both
hands, he dashed it furiously against the door,
making the passage echo with the blows.</p>
<p><pp>By degrees, his fears vanished, and hearing
nothing, he grew calmer. His spirits revived,
and encouraging himself with the idea that the
present impediment, though the greatest, was</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>307Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010125">
<pb n="167">
<pp>the last, he set himself seriously to consider
how it might best be overcome.</pp></p>
<p>On reflection, it occurred to him that he
might, perhaps, be able to loosen the iron
fillet; a notion no sooner conceived than executed.
With incredible labour, and by the
aid of both spike and nail, he succeeded in
getting the point of the bar beneath the fillet.
Exerting all his energies, and using the bar
as a lever, he forced off the iron band, which was
full seven feet high, seven inches wide, and two
thick, and which brought with it in its fall the
box of the lock and the socket of the bolt,
leaving no further hinderance.</p>
<p>Overjoyed beyond measure at having vanquished
this apparently&hyphen;insurmountable obstacle,
Jack darted through the door.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Ascending</smallcap> a short flight of steps, Jack
found at the summit a door, which being
bolted in the inside he speedily opened.</p>
<p><pp>The fresh air, which blew in his face, greatly
revived him. He had now reached what was
called the Lower Leads,&mdash;a flat, covering a
part of the prison contiguous to the gateway,
and surrounded on all sides by walls about
fourteen feet high. On the north stood the
battlements of one of the towers of the gate.
On this side a flight of wooden steps, protected
by a hand&hyphen;rail, led to a door opening upon the
summit of the prison. This door was crested
with spikes, and guarded on the right by a</pp>
<pb n="169">
<pp>bristling semi&hyphen;circle of spikes. Hastily ascending
these steps, Jack found the door, as he anticipated,
locked. He could have easily forced
it, but preferred a more expeditious mode of
reaching the roof which suggested itself to
him. Mounting the door he had last opened,
he placed his hands on the wall above, and
quickly drew himself up.</pp></p>
<p>Just as he got on the roof of the prison, St.
Sepulchre's clock struck eight. It was instantly
answered by the deep note of St. Paul's; and
the concert was prolonged by other neighbouring
churches. Jack had thus been six hours in
accomplishing his arduous task.</p>
<p><pp>Though nearly dark, there was still light
enough left to enable him to discern surrounding
objects. Through the gloom he distinctly
perceived the dome of St. Paul's, hanging like
a black cloud in the air; and nearer to him he
remarked the golden ball on the summit of the
College of Physicians, compared by Garth to a
&ldquo;gilded pill.&rdquo; Other towers and spires&mdash;St.
Martin's on Ludgate&hyphen;hill, and Christchurch in
Newgate&hyphen;street, were also distinguishable. As</pp>
<pb n="170">
<pp>he gazed down into the courts of the prison,
he could not help shuddering, lest a false
step might precipitate him below.</pp></p>
<p>To prevent the recurrence of any such
escape as that just described, it was deemed
expedient, in more recent times, to keep a
watchman at the top of Newgate. Not many
years ago, two men, employed on this duty,
quarrelled during the night, and in the morning
their bodies were found stretched upon
the pavement of the yard beneath.</p>
<p>Proceeding along the wall, Jack reached
the southern tower, over the battlements of
which he clambered, and crossing it, dropped
upon the roof of the gate. He then scaled
the northern tower, and made his way to the
summit of that part of the prison which fronted
Giltspur&hyphen;street. Arrived at the extremity of
the building, he found that it overlooked the
flat&hyphen;roof of a house which, as far as he could
judge in the darkness, lay at a depth of about
twenty feet below.</p>
<p><pp>Not choosing to hazard so great a fall, Jack
turned to examine the building, to see whether</pp>
<pb n="171">
<pp>any more favourable point of descent presented
itself, but could discover nothing but steep
walls, without a single available projection. As
he looked around, he beheld an incessant stream
of passengers hurrying on below. Lights glimmered
in the windows of the different houses; 
and a lamplighter was running from post to
post on his way to Snow Hill.</pp></p>
<p>Finding it impossible to descend on any side,
without incurring serious risk, Jack resolved to
return for his blanket, by the help of which he
felt certain of accomplishing a safe landing on
the roof of the house in Giltspur&hyphen;street.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he began to retrace his steps,
and pursuing the course he had recently taken,
scaling the two towers, and passing along the
wall of the prison, he descended by means of
the door upon the Lower Leads. Before he
re&hyphen;entered the prison, he hesitated, from a doubt
whether he was not fearfully increasing his risk
of capture; but, convinced that he had no
other alternative, he went on.</p>
<p><pp>During all this time, he had never quitted
the iron bar, and he now grasped it with</pp>
<pb n="172">
<pp>the firm determination of selling his life dearly,
if he met with any opposition. A few seconds
sufficed to clear the passage, through which it
had previously cost him more than two hours
to force his way. The floor was strewn with
screws, nails, fragments of wood and stone,
and across the passage lay the heavy iron
fillet. He did not disturb any of this litter,
but left it as a mark of his prowess.</pp></p>
<p>He was now at the entrance of the chapel,
and striking the door over which he had previously
climbed a violent blow with the bar, it
flew open. To vault over the pews was the work
of a moment; and having gained the entry leading
to the Red Room he passed through the first
door; his progress being only impeded by the
pile of broken stones, which he himself had
raised.</p>
<p><pp>Listening at one of the doors leading to the
Master Debtor's side, he heard a loud voice
chanting a Bacchanalian melody, and the boisterous
laughter that accompanied the song,
convinced him that no suspicion was entertained
in this quarter. Entering the Red</pp>
<pb n="173">
<pp>Room, he crept through the hole in the wall,
descended the chimney, and arrived once more
in his old place of captivity.</pp></p>
<p>How different were his present feelings compared
with those he had experienced on quitting
it. <it>Then</it>, though full of confidence, he half
doubted his power of accomplishing his designs.
<it>Now</it>, he <it>had</it> achieved them, and felt assured
of success. The vast heap of rubbish on the
floor had been so materially increased by the
bricks and plaster thrown down in his attack
upon the wall of the Red Room, that it was
with some difficulty he could find the blanket,
which was almost buried beneath the pile. He
next searched for his stockings and shoes, and
when found, put them on.</p>
<p>While he was thus employed, his nerves
underwent a severe shock. A few bricks, dislodged
probably by his last descent, came clattering
down the chimney, and as it was perfectly
dark, gave him the notion that some
one was endeavouring to force an entrance into
the room.</p>
<p><pp>But these fears, like those he had recently</pp>
<pb n="174">
<pp>experienced, speedily vanished, and he prepared
to return to the roof, congratulating
himself that owing to the opportune falling of
the bricks, he had in all probability escaped
serious injury.</pp></p>
<p>Throwing the blanket over his left arm and
shouldering the iron bar, he again clambered
up the chimney; regained the Red Room; 
hurried along the first passage; crossed the
Chapel; threaded the entry to the Lower
Leads; and, in less than ten minutes after
quitting the Castle, had reached the northern
extremity of the prison.</p>
<p>Previously to his descent he had left the
nail and spike on the wall, and with these he
fastened the blanket to the stone coping. This
done, he let himself carefully down by it, and
having only a few feet to drop, alighted in
safety.</p>
<p><pp>Having now fairly got out of Newgate for
the second time, with a heart throbbing with
exultation, he hastened to make good his escape.
To his great joy he found a small
garret&hyphen;door in the roof of the opposite house</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>288Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010126">
<pb n="175">
<pp>open. He entered it; crossed the room, in
which there was only a small truckle&hyphen;bed, over
which he stumbled; opened another door and
gained the stair&hyphen;head. As he was about to
descend his chains slightly rattled. &ldquo;Oh, lud!
what's that?&rdquo; exclaimed a female voice, from
an adjoining room. &ldquo;Only the dog,&rdquo; replied
the rough tones of a man.</pp></p>
<p>Securing the chain in the best way he
could, Jack then hurried down two pair of stairs,
and had nearly reached the lobby, when a
door suddenly opened, and two persons appeared,
one of whom held a light. Retreating
as quickly as he could, Jack opened the
first door he came to, entered a room, and
searching in the dark for some place of concealment,
fortunately discovered a skreen, behind
which he crept.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Jack</smallcap> was scarcely concealed when the door
opened, and the two persons of whom he had
caught a glimpse below entered the room.
What was his astonishment to recognise in
the few words they uttered the voices of
Kneebone and Winifred! The latter was apparently
in great distress, and the former
seemed to be using his best efforts to relieve
her anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very fortunate it is,&rdquo; he observed,
&ldquo;that I happened to call upon Mr. Bird, the
turner, to give him an order this evening. It
was quite an unexpected pleasure to meet you
and your worthy father.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Pray cease these compliments,&rdquo; returned</pp>
<pb n="177">
<pp>Winifred, &ldquo;and, if you have any communication
to make, do not delay it? You told
me just now that you wished to speak a few
words to me in private, concerning Thames
Darrell, and for that purpose I have left my
father below with Mr. Bird and have come
hither. What have you got to say?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; replied Kneebone, shaking his
head; &ldquo;sadly too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not needlessly alarm me, I beseech
you,&rdquo; replied Winifred. &ldquo;Whatever your intelligence
may be I will strive to bear it.
But do not awaken my apprehensions, unless
you have good cause for so doing?&mdash;What
do you know of Thames?&mdash;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't agitate yourself, dearest girl,&rdquo; rejoined
the woollen&hyphen;draper; &ldquo;or I shall never
be able to commence my relation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am calm&mdash;perfectly calm,&rdquo; replied Winifred.
&ldquo;Pray, make no further mystery; but
tell me all without reserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you require it, I must obey,&rdquo; replied
Kneebone; &ldquo;but prepare yourself for a terrible
shock.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="178">
<p>&ldquo;For mercy's sake, go on!&rdquo; cried Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all hazards then you shall know the
truth,&rdquo; replied the woollen&hyphen;draper, in a tone
of affected solicitude,&mdash;&ldquo;but are you really
prepared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite&mdash;quite!&rdquo; replied Winifred. &ldquo;This
suspense is worse than torture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am almost afraid to utter it,&rdquo; said Kneebone; 
&ldquo;but Thames Darrell is murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; ejaculated Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basely and inhumanly murdered, by Jack
Sheppard and Blueskin,&rdquo; continued Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;no,&rdquo; cried Winifred, &ldquo;I
cannot believe it. You must be misinformed,
Mr. Kneebone. Jack may be capable of much
that is wicked, but he would never lift his
hand against his friend,&mdash;of that I am assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generous girl!&rdquo; cried Jack from behind
the skreen.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I have proofs to the contrary,&rdquo; replied
Kneebone. &ldquo;The murder was committed after
the robbery of my house by Sheppard and</pp>
<pb n="179">
<pp>his accomplices. I did not choose to mention
my knowledge of this fact to your worthy
father; but you may rely on its correctness.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right not to mention it to him,&rdquo; 
rejoined Winifred, &ldquo;for he is in such a state
of distress at the mysterious disappearance
of Mrs. Sheppard, that I fear any further
anxiety might prove fatal to him. And yet
I know not&mdash;for the object of his visit here
to&hyphen;night was to serve Jack, who, if your
statement is correct, which I cannot however
for a moment believe, does not deserve his
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may rest assured he does not,&rdquo; rejoined
Kneebone, emphatically, &ldquo;but I am at
a loss to understand in what way your father
proposes to assist him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bird, the turner, who is an old friend
of our's, has some acquaintance with the turnkeys
of Newgate,&rdquo; replied Winifred, &ldquo;and by
his means my father hoped to convey some implements
to Jack, by which he might effect
another escape.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="180">
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; remarked Kneebone. &ldquo;This must
be prevented,&rdquo; he added to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven grant you may have been wrongly
informed with respect to Thames!&rdquo; exclaimed
Winifred; &ldquo;but, I beseech you, on no account
to mention what you have told me to my poor
father. He is not in a state of mind to
bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rely on me,&rdquo; rejoined Kneebone. &ldquo;One
word before we part, adorable girl&mdash;only
one,&rdquo; he continued, detaining her. &ldquo;I would
not venture to renew my suit while Thames
lived, because I well knew your affections
were fixed upon him. But now that this bar
is removed, I trust I may, without impropriety,
urge it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more of this,&rdquo; said Winifred, angrily.
&ldquo;Is this a season to speak on such a subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; rejoined the woollen&hyphen;draper; 
&ldquo;but the uncontrollable violence of my passion
must plead my excuse. My whole life
shall be devoted to you, beloved girl. And
when you reflect how much at heart your
poor mother, whose loss we must ever deplore,</pp>
<pb n="181">
<pp>had our union, you will, I am persuaded,
no longer refuse me.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will make me the happiest of mankind,&rdquo; 
cried the woollen&hyphen;draper, falling on his
knees, and seizing her hand, which he devoured
with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; cried Winifred. &ldquo;I disbelieve
the whole story you have told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heaven!&rdquo; cried Kneebone, with increasing
fervour, &ldquo;it is true&mdash;as true as my
affection for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt it,&rdquo; retorted Winifred,
scornfully; &ldquo;because I attach credit neither
to one nor the other. If Thames <it>is</it> murdered,
you are his assassin. Let me go, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woollen&hyphen;draper made no answer, but
hastily starting up, bolted the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Winifred in
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more than to obtain a favourable
answer to my suit,&rdquo; replied Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the way to obtain it,&rdquo; said Winifred,
endeavouring to reach the door.</p>
<pb n="182">
<p>&ldquo;You shall not go, adorable girl,&rdquo; cried
Kneebone, catching her in his arms, &ldquo;till you
have answered me. You must&mdash;you shall be
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Winifred. &ldquo;Release me
instantly, or I will call my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; replied Kneebone; &ldquo;but remember
the door is locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monster!&rdquo; cried Winifred. &ldquo;Help!
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call in vain,&rdquo; returned Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied Jack, throwing down
the skreen. &ldquo;Release her instantly, villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Winifred and her suitor started at this
sudden apparition. Jack, whose clothes were
covered with dust, and whose face was deathly
pale from his recent exertion, looked more like
a phantom than a living person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the devil's name, is that you, Jack?&rdquo; 
ejaculated Kneebone.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Sheppard. &ldquo;You have uttered
a wilful and deliberate falsehood in asserting
that I have murdered Thames, for</pp>
<pb n="183">
<pp>whom you well know I would lay down my life.
Retract your words instantly, or take the consequences.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I retract, villain?&rdquo; cried the
woollen&hyphen;draper, who at the sound of Jack's
voice had regained his confidence. &ldquo;To the
best of my belief, Thames Darrell has been
murdered by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack in a terrible tone.
And before Kneebone could draw his sword,
he felled him to the ground with the iron
bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have killed him,&rdquo; cried Winifred in
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jack, approaching her,
&ldquo;though, if I had done so, he would have
merited his fate. You do not believe his statement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; replied Winifred. &ldquo;I could
not believe you capable of so foul a deed. But
oh! by what wonderful chance have you come
hither so seasonably?&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I have just escaped from Newgate,&rdquo; replied
Jack; &ldquo;and am more than repaid for</pp>
<pb n="184">
<pp>the severe toil I have undergone, in being
able to save you. But tell me,&rdquo; he added
with much anxiety, &ldquo;has nothing been heard
of Thames since the night of my former
escape?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; answered Winifred.
&ldquo;He left Dollis Hill at ten o'clock on that
night, and has not since returned. My father
has made every possible inquiry, and
offered large rewards; but has not been able
to discover the slightest trace of him. His
suspicions at first fell upon you. But he has
since acquitted you of any share in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been indefatigable in his search,&rdquo; 
continued Winifred, &ldquo;and has even journeyed
to Manchester. But though he visited Sir
Rowland Trenchard's seat, Asheton Hall, he
could gain no tidings of him, or of his uncle,
Sir Rowland, who, it seems, has left the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Never to return,&rdquo; remarked Jack, gloomily.
&ldquo;Before to&hyphen;morrow morning I will ascertain
what has become of Thames, or perish in the</pp>
<pb n="185">
<pp>attempt. And now tell me what has happened
to my poor mother?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since your last capture, and Thames's
mysterious disappearance, she has been dreadfully
ill,&rdquo; replied Winifred; &ldquo;so ill, that each
day was expected to be her last. She has also
been afflicted with occasional returns of her
terrible malady. On Tuesday night, she was
rather better, and I had left her for a short
time, as I thought, asleep on the sofa in the
little parlour of which she is so fond&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my return, I found the window open,
and the room vacant. She was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you discover any trace of footsteps?&rdquo; 
inquired Jack eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were some marks near the window; 
but whether recently made or not could not
be ascertained,&rdquo; replied Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, in a tone of
the bitterest anguish. &ldquo;My worst fears are
realized. She is in Wild's power.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I ought to add,&rdquo; continued Winifred,
&ldquo;that one of her shoes was picked up in the</pp>
<pb n="186">
<pp>garden, and that prints of her feet were discovered
along the soft mould; whether made
in flying from any one, or from rushing forth
in distracted terror, it is impossible to say.
My father thought the latter. He has had
the whole country searched; but hitherto without
success.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I know <it>where</it> she will be found, and <it>how</it>,&rdquo; 
rejoined Jack with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something further to tell you,&rdquo; 
pursued Winifred. &ldquo;Shortly after your last
visit to Dollis Hill, my father was one evening
waylaid by a man, who informed him that
he had something to communicate respecting
Thames, and had a large sum of money, and
some important documents to deliver to him,
which would be given up, provided he would
undertake to procure your liberation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Blueskin,&rdquo; observed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my father thought,&rdquo; replied Winifred; 
&ldquo;and he therefore instantly fired upon him.
But though the shot took effect, as was evident
from the stains on the ground, the villain
escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="187">
<p>&ldquo;Your father did right,&rdquo; replied Jack, with
some bitterness. &ldquo;But if he had not fired that
shot, he might have saved Thames, and possessed
himself of papers which would have established
his birth, and his right to the estates
of the Trenchard family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have had him spare my
mother's murderer?&rdquo; cried Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;but
it is only part of the chain of ill&hyphen;luck that
seems wound around me. Listen to me, Winifred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he hastily related the occurrences in
Jonathan Wild's house.</p>
<p>The account of the discovery of Sir Rowland's
murder filled Winifred with alarm; but
when she learnt what had befallen Thames&mdash; 
how he had been stricken down by the thieftaker's
bludgeon, and left for dead, she
uttered a piercing scream, fainted, and would
have fallen, if Jack had not caught her in
his arms.</p>
<p><pp>Jack had well&hyphen;nigh fallen too. The idea
that he held in his arms the girl whom he had</pp>
<pb n="188">
<pp>once so passionately loved, and for whom he
still retained an ardent but hopeless attachment,
almost overcame him. Gazing at her
with eyes blinded with tears, he imprinted
one brotherly kiss upon her lips. It was the
first&mdash;and the last!</pp></p>
<p>At this juncture, the handle of the door was
tried, and the voice of Mr. Wood was heard
without, angrily demanding admittance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I thought
I heard a scream. Why is the door fastened?
Open it directly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo; asked Jack, mimicking
the voice of Kneebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Wood. &ldquo;Open
the door, I say, or I'll burst it open.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Carefully depositing Winifred on a sofa,
Jack then extinguished the light, and, as he unfastened
the door, crept behind it. In rushed
Mr. Wood, with a candle in his hand, which
Jack instantly blew out, and darted down stairs.
He upset some one&mdash;probably Mr. Bird,&mdash;who
was rushing up&hyphen;stairs, alarmed by Mr. Wood's
cries: but, regardless of this, he darted along</pp>
<pb n="189">
<pp>a passage, gained the shop, and passed through
an open door into the street.</pp></p>
<p>And thus he was once more free, having
effected one of the most wonderful escapes ever
planned or accomplished.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>About</smallcap> seven o'clock on the same night,
Jonathan Wild's two janizaries, who had been
for some time in attendance in the hall of his
dwelling at the Old Bailey, were summoned
to the audience&hyphen;chamber. A long and secret
conference then took place between the thieftaker
and his myrmidons, after which they
were severally dismissed.</p>
<p><pp>Left alone, Jonathan lighted a lamp, and,
opening the trap&hyphen;door, descended the secret
stairs. Taking the opposite course from that
which he had hitherto pursued when it has
been necessary to attend him in his visits to
the lower part of his premises, he struck into
a narrow passage on the right, which he tracked</pp>
<pb n="191">
<pp>till he came to a small door, like the approach
to a vault. Unlocking it, he entered the
chamber, which by no means belied its external
appearance.</pp></p>
<p>On a pallet in one corner lay a pale emaciated
female. Holding the lamp over her
rigid but beautiful features, Jonathan, with
some anxiety, placed his hand upon her breast
to ascertain whether the heart still beat. Satisfied
with his scrutiny, he produced a pocketflask,
and taking off the silver cup with which
it was mounted, filled it with the contents of
the flask, and then seizing the thin arm of the
sleeper, rudely shook it. Opening her large
black eyes, she fixed them upon him for a
moment with a mixture of terror and loathing,
and then averted her gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; cried Jonathan, handing her
the cup. &ldquo;You'll feel better after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mechanically raising the potion to her lips,
the poor creature swallowed it without hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it poison?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, with a brutal</pp>
<pb n="192">
<pp>laugh. &ldquo;I'm not going to get rid of you
just yet. It's gin&mdash;a liquor you used to like.
You'll find the benefit of it by and by.
You've a good deal to go through to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sheppard, &ldquo;are you
come to renew your terrible proposals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm come to execute my threats,&rdquo; replied
Wild. &ldquo;To&hyphen;night you shall be my
wedded wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will die first,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may die <it>afterwards</it> as soon as you
please,&rdquo; retorted Jonathan; &ldquo;but live till then
you <it>shall</it>. I've sent for the priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard, vainly
trying to discover a gleam of compassion in the
thieftaker's inexorable countenance,&mdash;&ldquo;Mercy!
mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan. &ldquo;You should
be glad to be made an honest woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! let me die,&rdquo; groaned the widow. &ldquo;I
have not many days,&mdash;perhaps, not many hours
to live. But kill me rather than commit this
outrage.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That wouldn't answer my purpose,&rdquo; replied</pp>
<pb n="193">
<pp>Jonathan, savagely. &ldquo;I didn't carry you
off from old Wood to kill you, but to wed
you.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;What motive can you have for so vile a
deed?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my motive well enough,&rdquo; answered
Jonathan. &ldquo;However, I'll refresh your
memory. I once might have married you for
your beauty,&mdash;now I marry you for your
wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wealth,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;I
have nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are heiress to the Trenchard property,&rdquo; 
rejoined Jonathan, &ldquo;one of the largest
estates in Lancashire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while Thames Darrell and Sir Rowland
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Rowland is dead,&rdquo; replied Jonathan,
gloomily. &ldquo;Thames Darrell only waits my
mandate to follow him. Before our marriage
there will be no life between you and the
estates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; cried Jonathan, stooping down</pp>
<pb n="194">
<pp>and taking hold of a ring in the floor, with
which by a great effort he raised up a flag.
&ldquo;In this pit,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the chasm
below, &ldquo;your brother is buried. Here your
nephew will speedily be thrown.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard, shuddering
violently. &ldquo;But your dreadful projects
will recoil on your own head. Heaven will
not permit the continuance of such wickedness
as you practise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll take my chance,&rdquo; replied Jonathan,
with a sinister smile. &ldquo;My schemes have succeeded
tolerably well hitherto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A day of retribution will assuredly arrive,&rdquo; 
rejoined Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till then, I shall remain content,&rdquo; returned
Wild. &ldquo;And now, Mrs. Sheppard, attend to
what I'm about to say to you. Years ago,
when you were a girl and in the bloom of your
beauty, I loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loved me! <it>You</it>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I loved you,&rdquo; continued Jonathan, &ldquo;and
struck by your appearance, which seemed
above your station, inquired your history, and</pp>
<pb n="195">
<pp>found you had been stolen by a gipsey in
Lancashire. I proceeded to Manchester, to
investigate the matter further, and when there
ascertained, beyond a doubt, that you were the
eldest daughter of Sir Montacute Trenchard.
This discovery made, I hastened back to London
to offer you my hand, but found you had married
in the mean time a smock&hyphen;faced, smooth&hyphen;tongued
carpenter named Sheppard. The important
secret remained locked in my breast, but
I resolved to be avenged. I swore I would
bring your husband to the gallows,&mdash;would
plunge you in such want, such distress, that
you should have no alternative but the last
frightful resource of misery,&mdash;and I also swore,
that if you had a son he should share the same
fate as his father.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;And terribly you have kept your vow,&rdquo; 
replied Mrs. Sheppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Jonathan. &ldquo;But I am
now coming to the point which most concerns
you. Consent to become my wife, and do not
compel me to have recourse to violence to effect
my purpose, and I will spare your son.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="196">
<p>Mrs. Sheppard looked fixedly at him, as if
she would penetrate the gloomy depths of his
soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear that you will do this,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan, readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is an oath to you!&rdquo; cried the
widow, distrustfully. &ldquo;You will not hesitate
to break it, if it suits your purpose. I have
suffered too much from your treachery. I will
not trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, sternly.
&ldquo;Recollect you are in my power. Jack's life
hangs on your determination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard,
in a voice of agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save him,&rdquo; replied Jonathan. &ldquo;You <it>can</it>
do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him here,&mdash;let me see him&mdash;let me
embrace him&mdash;let me be assured that he is safe,
and I am your's. I swear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; exclaimed Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hesitate&mdash;you are deceiving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my soul, no,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, with
affected sincerity. &ldquo;You shall see him to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="197">
<p>&ldquo;Delay the marriage till then. I will never
consent till I see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask impossibilities,&rdquo; replied Jonathan,
sullenly. &ldquo;All is prepared. The marriage
cannot&mdash;shall not be delayed. You must
be mine to&hyphen;night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Force shall not make me yours till Jack is
free,&rdquo; replied the widow, resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour hence, I shall return with the
priest,&rdquo; replied Jonathan, striding towards the
door.</p>
<p>And, with a glance of malignant exultation,
he quitted the vault, and locked the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour hence, I shall be beyond your
malice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheppard, sinking backwards
upon the pallet.</p></div4>

<subhead>THE LAST MEETING BETWEEN JACK SHEPPARD AND HIS
MOTHER.</subhead> <attbytes>14Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030672</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard. A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><smallcap>After</smallcap> escaping from the turner's house,
Jack Sheppard skirted St. Sepulchre's church,
and hurrying down Snow Hill, darted into the
first turning on the left. Traversing Angel
Court, and Green Arbour Court,&mdash;celebrated
as one of Goldsmith's retreats,&mdash;he speedily
reached Seacoal Lane, and pursuing the same
course, which he and Thames had formerly
taken, arrived at the yard at the back of Jonathan's
habitation.</p>
<p><pp>A door, it may be remembered, opened
from Wild's dwelling into this yard. Before
he forced an entrance, Jack tried it, and,
to his great surprise and delight, found it
unfastened. Entering the house, he found
himself in a narrow passage leading to the</pp>
<pb n="199">
<pp>back stairs. He had not taken many steps
when he perceived Quilt Arnold in the upper
gallery, with a lamp in his hand. Hearing a
noise below, Quilt called out, supposing it occasioned
by the Jew. Jack hastily retreated,
and taking the first means of concealment that
occurred to him, descended the cellar steps.</pp></p>
<p>Quilt, meanwhile, came down, examined the
door, and finding it unfastened, locked it with
a bitter imprecation on his brother&hyphen;janizary's
carelessness. This done, he followed the
course which Jack had just taken. As he
crossed the cellar, he passed so near to Jack
who had concealed himself behind a piece of
furniture that he almost touched him. It was
Jack's intention to have knocked him down with
the iron bar; but he was so struck with the
janizary's looks, that he determined to spare
him till he had ascertained his purpose. With
this view, he suffered him to pass on.</p>
<p><pp>Quilt's manner, indeed, was that of a man endeavouring
to muster up sufficient resolution for
the commission of some desperate crime. He
halted,&mdash;looked fearfully around,&mdash;stopped</pp>
<pb n="200">
<pp>again, and exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;I don't like the
job; and yet it must be done, or Mr. Wild will
hang me.&rdquo; With this, he appeared to pluck
up his courage, and stepped forward more
boldly.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Some dreadful deed is about to be committed,
which I may perhaps prevent,&rdquo; muttered
Jack to himself. &ldquo;Heaven grant I may not
be too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Followed by Jack Sheppard, who kept sufficiently
near him to watch his proceedings, and
yet not expose himself, Quilt unlocked one or
two doors which he left open, and after winding
his way along a gloomy passage, arrived at
the door of a vault. Here he set down the
lamp, and took out a key, and as he did so the
expression of his countenance was so atrocious,
that Jack felt assured he was not wrong in his
suspicions.</p>
<p><pp>By this time, the door was unlocked, and
drawing his sword, Quilt entered the cell. The
next moment, and exclamation was heard in the
voice of Thames. Darting forward at this
sound, Jack threw open the door, and beheld</pp>
<pb n="201">
<pp>Quilt kneeling over Thames, whose hands and
feet were bound with cords, and about to plunge
his sword into his breast. A blow from the
iron bar instantly stretched the ruffian on the
floor. Jack then proceeded to liberate the captive
from his bondage.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Thames. &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Sheppard, as he untied the
cords. &ldquo;I might return the question. Were
it not for your voice, I don't think I should
know you. You are greatly altered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captivity had, indeed, produced a striking
alteration in Thames. He looked like the
shadow of himself&mdash;thin, feeble, hollow&hyphen;eyed
&mdash;his beard unshorn&mdash;nothing could be more
miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been out of this horrible
dungeon since we last met,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;though
how long ago that is, I scarcely know.
Night and day have been alike to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six weeks have elapsed since that fatal
night,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;During the whole of
that time I have been a close prisoner in Newgate,
whence I have only just escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="202">
<p>&ldquo;Six weeks!&rdquo; exclaimed Thames, in a melancholy
tone. &ldquo;It seems like six long months
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt it,&rdquo; returned Jack; &ldquo;none
but those who have experienced it can understand
the miseries of imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not speak of it,&rdquo; rejoined Thames,
with a look of horror. &ldquo;Let us fly from this
frightful place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will conduct you to the outlet,&rdquo; replied
Jack; &ldquo;but I cannot leave it till I have ascertained
whether my mother also is a prisoner
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer that,&rdquo; replied Thames. &ldquo;She
is. The monster, Wild, when he visited my
dungeon last night, told me, to add to my
misery, that she occupied a cell near me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arm yourself with that ruffian's weapons,&rdquo; 
replied Jack, &ldquo;and let us search for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thames complied. But he was so feeble,
that it seemed scarcely possible he could offer
any effectual resistance in case of an attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lean on me,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p><pp>Taking the light, they then proceeded along</pp>
<pb n="203">
<pp>the passage. There was no other door in it,
and Jack therefore struck into another entry
which branched off to the right. They had not
proceeded far when a low moan was heard.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;She is here,&rdquo; cried Jack, darting forward.</p>
<p>A few steps brought him to the door of the
vault in which his mother was immured. It
was locked. Jack had brought away the bunch
of keys which he had taken from Quilt Arnold,
but none of them would open it. He was therefore
obliged to use the iron bar, which he did
with as much caution as circumstances would
permit. At the first blow, Mrs. Sheppard uttered
a piercing scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you shall not force
me to your hateful purpose. I will never wed
you. I have a weapon&mdash;a knife&mdash;and if you
attempt to open the door, will plunge it to
my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, paralysed by
her cries. &ldquo;What shall I do? If I persist, I
shall destroy her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Get hence,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Sheppard, with</pp>
<pb n="204">
<pp>a frenzied laugh. &ldquo;You shall never behold me
alive.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Jack, in a broken voice.
&ldquo;It is your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;Think
not to deceive me, monster. I know my son's
voice too well. He is in Newgate. Hence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! dear mother!&rdquo; cried Jack, in a
voice, the tones of which were altered by his
very anxiety to make them distinct, &ldquo;listen to
me. I have broken from prison, and am come
to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <it>not</it> Jack's voice,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Sheppard.
&ldquo;I am not to be deceived. The knife
is at my breast. Stir a foot, and I strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh heavens!&rdquo; cried Jack, driven to his
wits' end. &ldquo;Mother&mdash;dear mother! Once
again, I beseech you to listen to me. I am
come to rescue you from Wild's violence. I
must break open the door. Hold your hand
for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You have heard my fixed determination,
villain,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;I know my
life is valuable to you, or you would not spare</pp>
<pb n="205">
<pp>it. But I will disappoint you. Get you gone.
Your purposes are defeated.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Footsteps are approaching,&rdquo; cried Thames.
&ldquo;Heed her not. It is but a wild threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not how to act,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack,
almost driven to desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you plotting with your wicked associates,&rdquo; 
cried Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;I have baffled
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Force the door,&rdquo; said Thames, &ldquo;or you
will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better she die by her own hand, than by
that monster's,&rdquo; cried Jack, brandishing the bar.
&ldquo;Mother, I come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, he struck the door a heavy blow.</p>
<p>He listened. There was a deep groan, and
the sound of a fall within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have killed her,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, dropping
the bar,&mdash;&ldquo;by your advice, Thames. Oh
God! pardon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not delay,&rdquo; cried Thames. &ldquo;She may
yet be saved. I am too weak to aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack again seized the bar, and, dashing it furiously
against the door, speedily burst it open.</p>
<pb n="206">
<p>The unfortunate woman was stretched upon
the floor, with a bloody knife in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Jack, springing towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she cried, raising her head. &ldquo;Is
it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied her son. &ldquo;Oh! why would
you not listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was distracted,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard,
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have killed you,&rdquo; cried Jack, endeavouring
to staunch the effusion of blood from her
breast. &ldquo;Forgive&mdash;forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to forgive,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Sheppard. &ldquo;I alone am to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I not carry you where you can obtain
help?&rdquo; cried Jack in an agony of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard: &ldquo;nothing
can save me. I die happy&mdash;quite happy
in beholding you. Do not remain with me.
You may fall into the hands of your enemy.
Fly! fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not think of me, mother, but of yourself,&rdquo; 
cried Jack, in an agony of tears.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;You have always been far dearer to me</pp>
<pb n="207">
<pp>than myself,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sheppard. &ldquo;But
I have one last request to make. Let me lie in
Willesden churchyard.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall&mdash;you shall,&rdquo; answered Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall meet again ere long, my son,&rdquo; 
cried Mrs. Sheppard, fixing her glazing eyes
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God! she is dying,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack in a
voice suffocated by emotion. &ldquo;Forgive me&mdash; 
oh, forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive you&mdash;bless you!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>A cold shiver ran through her frame, and
her gentle spirit passed away for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God! that I might die too,&rdquo; cried
Jack, falling on his knees beside her.</p>
<p>After the first violent outbreak of grief had
in some degree subsided, Thames addressed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not remain here,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You can render no further service to your
poor mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can avenge her,&rdquo; cried Jack in a terrible
tone.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Be ruled by me,&rdquo; returned Thames.
&ldquo;You will act most in accordance with her</pp>
<pb n="208">
<pp>wishes, could she dictate them, by compliance.
Do not waste time in vain regrets, but let us
remove the body, that we may fulfil her last
injunctions.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>After some further arguments, Jack assented
to this proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on first with the light,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
will bear the body.&rdquo; And he raised it in his
arms.</p>
<p>Just as they reached the end of the passage,
they heard the voices of Jonathan and the Jew
in Thames's late place of confinement. Wild
had evidently discovered the body of Quilt
Arnold, and was loudly expressing his anger
and astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extinguish the light,&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;turn
to the left. Quick! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order was only just given in time.
They had scarcely gained the adjoining cellar
when Jonathan and the Jew rushed past in the
direction of the vault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a moment is to be lost,&rdquo; cried Jack:
&ldquo;follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>So saying, he hurried up stairs, opened the</pp>
<pb n="209">
<pp>back door, and was quickly in the yard.
Having ascertained that Thames was at his
heels, he hurried with his ghastly burthen
down Seacoal&hyphen;lane.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; cried Thames,
who, though wholly disencumbered, was scarcely
able to keep up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not&mdash;and care not,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>At this moment, a coach passed them, and
was instantly hailed by Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better let me convey her to Dollis
Hill,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>Luckily it was so dark, and there was no
lamp near, that the man did not notice the condition
of the body, which was placed in the vehicle
by the two young men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; asked Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me to my fate,&rdquo; rejoined Jack.
&ldquo;Take care of your charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubt me not,&rdquo; replied Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bury her in Willesden churchyard, as she
requested, on Sunday,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I will be
there at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="210">
<p>So saying, he closed the door.</p>
<p>The coachman having received his order, and
being offered an extra fare if he drove quickly,
set off at full speed.</p>
<p>As Jack departed, a dark figure, emerging
from behind a wall, rushed after him.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>After</smallcap> running to some distance down Seacoal&hyphen;lane, Jack stopped to give a last look at the
vehicle which was bearing away the remains of
his beloved and ill&hyphen;fated mother. It was
scarcely out of sight, when two persons, whom
he instantly recognized as Jonathan and Abraham
Mendez, turned the corner of the street,
and made it evident from their shouts, that
they likewise perceived him.</p>
<p><pp>Starting off at a rapid pace, Jack dashed
down Turnagain&hyphen;lane, skirted the eastern bank
of Fleet&hyphen;ditch, crossed Holborn Bridge, and
began to ascend the neighbouring hill. By the
time he had reached St. Andrew's Church, his
pursuers had gained the bridge, and the attention</pp>
<pb n="212">
<pp>of such passengers as crowded the streets
was attracted towards him by their vociferations.
Amongst others, the watchman whose box was
placed against the churchyard wall, near the
entrance to Shoe&hyphen;lane, rushed out and sprung
his rattle, which was immediately answered by
another rattle from Holborn&hyphen;bars.</pp></p>
<p>Darting down Field&hyphen;lane, Jack struck into a
labyrinth of streets on the left; but though he
ran as swiftly as he could, he was not unperceived.
His course had been observed by the
watchman, who directed Wild which way to
take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Jack Sheppard, the noted housebreaker,&rdquo; 
cried Jonathan, at the top of his
sonorous voice. &ldquo;He has just broken out of
Newgate. After him! A hundred pounds to
the man who takes him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheppard's name operated like magic on the
crowd. The cry was echoed by twenty different
voices. People ran out of their shops to join
the pursuit; and, by the time Wild had got
into Field&hyphen;lane, he had a troop of fifty persons
at his heels&mdash;all eager to assist in the capture.</p>
<pb n="213">
<p>&ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo; roared Jonathan, who perceived
the fugitive hurrying along a street
towards Hatton Garden. &ldquo;It is Sheppard&mdash; 
Jack Sheppard&mdash;stop him!&rdquo; And his shouts
were reiterated by the pack of blood&hyphen;hounds
at his heels.</p>
<p>Jack, meanwhile, heard the shouts, and,
though alarmed by them, held on a steady
course. By various twistings and turnings,
during all which time his pursuers, who were
greatly increased in numbers, kept him in
view, he reached Gray's&hyphen;Inn&hyphen;lane. Here he
was hotly pursued. Fatigued by his previous
exertions, and incumbered by his fetters,
he was by no means&mdash;though ordinarily remarkably
swift of foot&mdash;a match for his foes,
who were fast gaining upon him.</p>
<p><pp>At the corner of Liquorpond&hyphen;street stood the
old Hampstead coach&hyphen;office; and, on the night
in question, a knot of hostlers, waggoners,
drivers, and stable&hyphen;boys was collected in the
yard. Hearing the distant shouts, these fellows
rushed down to the entrance of the court, and
arrived there just as Jack passed it. &ldquo;Stop</pp>
<pb n="214">
<pp>thief!&rdquo; roared Jonathan. &ldquo;Stop thief&rdquo; clamoured
the rabble behind.</pp></p>
<p>At no loss to comprehend that Jack was the
individual pointed out by these outcries, two of
the nearest of the group made a dash at him.
But Jack eluded their grasp. A large dog
was then set at him by a stable&hyphen;boy; but,
striking the animal with his faithful ironbar,
he speedily sent him yelping back. The
two hostlers, however, kept close at his heels; 
and Jack, whose strength began to flag, feared
he could not hold much longer. Determined,
however, not to be taken with life, he held on.</p>
<p><pp>Still keeping ahead of his pursuers, he ran
along the direct road, till the houses disappeared
and he got into the open country.
Here he was preparing to leap over the hedge
into the fields on the left, when he was intercepted
by two horsemen, who, hearing the
shouts, rode up and struck at him with the
butt&hyphen;ends of their heavy riding&hyphen;whips. Warding
off the blows as well as he could with the
bar, Jack struck both the horses on the head,
and the animals plunged so violently, that they</pp>
<pb n="215">
<pp>not only prevented their riders from assailing
him, but also kept off the hostlers; and, in
the confusion that ensued, Jack managed to
spring over the fence, and shaped his course
across the field in the direction of Sir John
Oldcastle's.</pp></p>
<p>The stoppage had materially lessened the
distance between him and his pursuers, who
now amounted to more than a hundred persons,
many of whom carried lanterns and links.
Ascertaining that it was Sheppard of whom
this concourse was in pursuit, the two horsemen
leapt the hedge, and were presently close
upon him. Like a hare closely pressed, Jack
attempted to double, but the device only
brought him nearer his foes, who were crossing
the field in every direction, and rending
the air with their shouts. The uproar was
tremendous&mdash;men yelling&mdash;dogs barking,&mdash; 
but above all was heard the stentorian voice
of Jonathan, urging them on. Jack was so
harassed that he felt half inclined to stand
at bay.</p>
<p><pp>While he was straining every sinew, his foot</pp>
<pb n="216">
<pp>slipped, and he fell, head foremost, into a
deep trench, which he had not observed in
the dark. This fall saved him, for the horsemen
passed over him. Creeping along quickly
on his hands and knees, he found the entrance
to a covered drain, into which he crept.
He was scarcely concealed when he heard the
horsemen, who perceived they had overshot
their mark, ride back.</pp></p>
<p>By this time, Jonathan and the vast mob
attending him, had come up, and the place
was rendered almost as light as day by the
links.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be somewhere hereabouts,&rdquo; cried
one of the horsemen, dismounting. &ldquo;We
were close upon him when he suddenly disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Jonathan made no answer, but snatching a
torch from a bystander, jumped into the
trench, and commenced a diligent search.
Just as he had arrived at the mouth of the
drain, and Jack felt certain he must be discovered,
a loud shout was raised from the
further end of the field that the fugitive was</pp>
<pb n="217">
<pp>caught. All the assemblage, accompanied by
Jonathan, set off in this direction, when it
turned out that the supposed housebreaker was
a harmless beggar, who had been found asleep
under a hedge.</pp></p>
<p>Jonathan's vexation at the disappointment
was expressed in the bitterest imprecations,
and he returned as speedily as he could to
the trench. But he had now lost the precise
spot; and thinking he had examined
the drain, turned his attention to another
quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the excitement of the chase had
in some degree subsided. The crowd dispersed
in different directions, and most fortunately
a heavy shower coming on, put
them altogether to flight. Jonathan, however,
still lingered. He seemed wholly insensible
to the rain, though it presently descended
in torrents, and continued his search
as ardently as before.</p>
<p><pp>After occupying himself thus for the best
part of an hour, he thought Jack must have
given him the slip. Still, his suspicions were</pp>
<pb n="218">
<pp>so strong, that he ordered Mendez to remain
on guard near the spot all night; and, by the
promise of a large reward, induced two other
men to keep him company.</pp></p>
<p>As he took his departure, he whispered to
the Jew: &ldquo;Take him dead or alive; but if
we fail now, and you heard him aright in
Seacoal Lane, we are sure of him at his mother's
funeral on Sunday.&rdquo;</p></div4>

<subhead>HOW JACK SHEPPARD GOT RID OF HIS IRONS.</subhead> <attbytes>13Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030674</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard. A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><smallcap>About</smallcap> an hour after this, Jack ventured to
emerge from his place of concealment. It was
still raining heavily, and profoundly dark.
Drenched to the skin,&mdash;in fact, he had been
lying in a bed of muddy water,&mdash;and chilled
to the very bone, he felt so stiff, that he could
scarcely move.</p>
<p>Listening attentively, he fancied he heard the
breathing of some one near him, and moved
cautiously in the opposite direction. In spite
of his care, he came in contact with a man,
who, endeavouring to grasp him, cried, in
the voice of Mendez, &ldquo;Who goes dere?
Shpeak! or I fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>No answer being returned, the Jew instantly</pp>
<pb n="220">
<pp>discharged his pistol, and though the shot did
no damage, the flash discovered Sheppard.
But as the next moment all was profound
darkness, Jack easily managed to break away
from them.</pp></p>
<p>Without an idea where he was going, Jack
pursued his way through the fields; and, as
he proceeded, the numbness of his limbs in
some degree wore off, and his confidence returned.
He had need of all the inexhaustible
energy of his character to support him through
his toilsome walk over the wet grass, or along
the slippery ploughed land. At last, he got
into a lane, but had not proceeded far when
he was again alarmed by the sound of a horse's
tread.</p>
<p><pp>Once more breaking through the hedge he
took to the fields. He was now almost driven
to despair. Wet as he was, he felt if he
lay down in the grass, he should perish with
cold; while, if he sought a night's lodging
in any asylum, his dress, stained with blood
and covered with dirt, would infallibly cause
him to be secured and delivered into the hands</pp>
<pb n="221">
<pp>of justice. And then the fetters, which were
still upon his legs:&mdash;how was he to get rid
of them?</pp></p>
<p>Tired and dispirited, he still wandered on.
Again returning to the main road, he passed
through Clapton; and turning off on the left,
arrived at the foot of Stamford Hill. He
walked on for an hour longer, till he could
scarcely drag one leg after another. At length,
he fell down on the road, fully expecting each
moment would prove his last.</p>
<p>How long he continued thus he scarcely
knew; but just before dawn, he managed to
regain his legs, and, crawling up a bank, perceived
he was within a quarter of a mile of
Tottenham. A short way off in the fields
he descried a sort of shed or cow&hyphen;house, and
thither he contrived to drag his weary limbs.
Opening the door, he found it littered with
straw, on which he threw himself, and instantly
fell asleep.</p>
<p><pp>When he awoke it was late in the day, and
raining heavily. For some time he could not
stir, but felt sick and exhausted. His legs</pp>
<pb n="222">
<pp>were dreadfully swelled; his hands bruised; 
and his fetters occasioned him intolerable pain.
His bodily suffering, however, was nothing
compared with his mental anguish. All the
events of the previous day rushed to his recollection; 
and though he had been unintentionally
the cause of his mother's death, he
reproached himself as severely as if he had
been her actual murderer.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Had I not been the guilty wretch I am,&rdquo; 
he cried, bursting into an agony of tears, &ldquo;she
would never have died thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strong feeling of remorse having found
a natural vent, in some degree subsided, and
he addressed himself to his present situation.
Rousing himself, he went to the door. It
had ceased raining, but the atmosphere was
moist and chill, and the ground deluged by
the recent showers. Taking up a couple of
large stones which lay near, Jack tried to
beat the round basils of the fetters into an
oval form, so as to enable him to slip his heels
through them.</p>
<p><pp>While he was thus employed a farming man</pp>
<pb n="223">
<pp>came into the barn. Jack instantly started
to his feet, and the man, alarmed at his
appearance, ran off to a neighbouring house.
Before he could return, Jack had made good
his retreat; and, wandering about the lanes
and hedges, kept out of sight as much as
possible.</pp></p>
<p>On examining his pockets, he found about
twenty guineas in gold, and some silver. But
how to avail himself of it was the question,
for in his present garb he was sure to be
recognised. When night fell, he crept into
the town of Tottenham. As he passed along
the main thoroughfare, he heard his own name
pronounced, and found that it was a hawker,
crying a penny history of his escapes. A
crowd was collected round the fellow, who
was rapidly disposing of his stock.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Here's the full, true, and particular account
of Jack Sheppard's last astonishing and
never&hyphen;to&hyphen;be&hyphen;forgotten escape from the Castle of
Newgate,&rdquo; bawled the hawker, &ldquo;with a print
of him taken from the life, showing the manner
how he was shackled and handcuffed. Only</pp>
<pb n="224">
<pp>one penny&mdash;two copies&mdash;two pence&mdash;thank
you, sir. Here's the&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Let me have one,&rdquo; cried a servant maid,
running across the street, and in her haste
forgetting to shut the door,&mdash;&ldquo;here's the
money. Master and missis have been talking
all day long about Jack Sheppard, and I'm
dying to read his life.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you have it, my dear,&rdquo; returned the
hawker. &ldquo;Sold again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don't get back quickly, Lucy,&rdquo; 
observed a bystander, &ldquo;Jack Sheppard will
be in the house before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sally occasioned a general laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Jack would come to my house, I'd contrive
to hide him,&rdquo; remarked a buxom dame.
&ldquo;Poor fellow! I'm glad he has escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack seems to be a great favourite with
the fair sex,&rdquo; observed a smirking grocer's
apprentice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; rejoined the bystander, who
had just spoken, and who was of a cynical
turn,&mdash;&ldquo;the greater the rascal, the better
they like him.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="225">
<p>&ldquo;Here's a particular account of Jack's many
robberies and escapes,&rdquo; roared the hawker,&mdash; 
&ldquo;how he broke into the house of his master,
Mr. Wood, at Dollis Hill&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Let me have one,&rdquo; said a carpenter, who
was passing by at the moment,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Wood
was an old friend of mine&mdash;and I recollect
seeing Jack when he was bound 'prentice to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A penny, if you please, sir,&rdquo; said the
hawker.&mdash;&ldquo;Sold again! Here you have the
full, true, and particular account of the barbarous
murder committed by Jack Sheppard
and his associate, Joseph Blake, <it>alias</it> Blueskin,
upon the body of Mrs. Wood&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;That's false!&rdquo; cried a voice behind him.</p>
<p>The man turned at the exclamation, and so
did several of the bystanders; but they could
not make out who had uttered it.</p>
<p>Jack, who had been lingering near the group,
now walked on.</p>
<p><pp>In the middle of the little town stood the
shop of a Jew dealer in old clothes. The
owner was at the door unhooking a few articles</pp>
<pb n="226">
<pp>of wearing apparel which he had exposed
outside for sale. Amongst other things, he
had just brought down an old laced bavaroy,
a species of surtout much worn at the period.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want for that coat, friend?&rdquo; 
asked Jack, as he came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you'll pay for it, friend,&rdquo; 
snuffled the Jew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; rejoined Jack.
&ldquo;Will you take a guinea for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double that sum might tempt me,&rdquo; replied
the Jew; &ldquo;it's a nobleman's coat, upon
my shoul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's the money,&rdquo; replied Jack, taking
the coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I help you on with it, sir?&rdquo; replied
the Jew, becoming suddenly respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>I half suspect this is a highwayman, thought
the Jew; he's so ready with his cash. &ldquo;I've
some other things inside, sir, which you might
wish to buy,&mdash;some pistols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was about to comply; but not liking the
man's manner, he walked on.</p>
<pb n="227">
<p>Further on, there was a small chandler's
shop, where Jack observed an old woman
seated at the counter, attended by a little
girl. Seeing provisions in the window, Jack
ventured in and bought a loaf. Having secured
this,&mdash;for he was almost famished,&mdash; 
he said that he had lost a hammer and wished
to purchase one. The old woman told him
she had no such article to dispose of, but
recommended him to a neighbouring blacksmith.</p>
<p>Guided by the glare of the forge, which
threw a stream of ruddy light across the road,
Jack soon found the place of which he was
in search. Entering the workshop, he found
the blacksmith occupied in heating the tire
of a cart&hyphen;wheel. Suspending his labour on
Jack's appearance, the man demanded his business.
Making up a similar story to that which
he had told the old woman, he said he wanted
to purchase a hammer and a file.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked hard at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me one question first?&rdquo; he said; 
&ldquo;I half suspect you're Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="228">
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Jack, without hesitation; 
for he felt assured from the man's manner that
he might confide in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're a bold fellow, Jack,&rdquo; rejoined the
blacksmith. &ldquo;But you've done well to trust
me. I'll take off your irons&mdash;for I guess
that's the reason why you want the hammer
and file&mdash;on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you give 'em to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Readily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking Jack into a shed behind the workshop,
the smith in a short time freed him
from his fetters. He not only did this, but
supplied him with an ointment which allayed
the swelling of his limbs, and crowned all
by furnishing him with a jug of excellent
ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid, Jack, you'll come to the
gallows,&rdquo; observed the smith; &ldquo;but if you
do, I'll go to Tyburn to see you. But I'll
never part with your irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Noticing the draggled condition Jack was
in, he then fetched him a bucket of water,</pp>
<pb n="229">
<pp>with which Jack cleansed himself as well as
he could, and thanking the honest smith, who
would take nothing for his trouble, left the
shop.</pp></p>
<p>Having made a tolerably good meal upon
the loaf, overcome by fatigue, Jack turned
into a barn in Stoke Newington, and slept
till late in the day, when he awakened much
refreshed. The swelling in his limbs had also
subsided. It rained heavily all day, so he did
not stir forth.</p>
<p>Towards night, however, he ventured out, and
walked on towards London. When he arrived
at Hoxton, he found the walls covered with
placards offering a reward for his apprehension,
and he everywhere appeared to be the
general subject of conversation. From a knot
of idlers at a public&hyphen;house, he learnt that Jonathan
Wild had just ridden past, and that
his setters were scouring the country in every
direction.</p>
<p><pp>Entering London, he bent his way towards
the west&hyphen;end; and having some knowledge of a
second&hyphen;hand tailor's shop in Rupert Street,</pp>
<pb n="230">
<pp>proceeded thither, and looked out a handsome
suit of mourning, with a sword, cloak, and hat,
and demanded the price. The man asked
twelve guineas, but after a little bargaining,
he came down to ten.</pp></p>
<p>Taking his new purchase under his arm,
Jack proceeded to a small tavern in the same
street, where, having ordered dinner, he went
to a bedroom to attire himself. He had scarcely
completed his toilet, when he was startled
by a noise at the door, and heard his own name
pronounced in no friendly accents. Fortunately,
the window was not far from the ground; 
so opening it gently, he dropped into a backyard,
and from thence got into the street.</p>
<p><pp>Hurrying down the Haymarket, he was
arrested by a crowd who were collected round
a street&hyphen;singer. Jack paused for a moment, and
found that his own adventures formed the subject
of the ballad. Not daring, however, to
listen to it, he ran on.</pp></p></div4>

A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><smallcap>That</smallcap> night Jack walked to Paddington, and
took up his quarters at a small tavern called
the Wheatsheaf, near the green. On the next
morning&mdash;Sunday&mdash;the day on which he expected
his mother's funeral to take place, he set
out along the Harrow Road.</p>
<p>It was a clear, lovely, October morning. The
air was sharp and bracing, and the leaves which
had taken their autumnal tints were falling
from the trees. The road which wound by
Westbourne Green, gave him a full view of the
hill of Hampstead with its church, its crest of
houses, and its villas peeping from out the trees.</p>
<p><pp>Jack's heart was too full to allow him to
derive any pleasure from this scene; so he</pp>
<pb n="232">
<pp>strolled on without raising his eyes till he
arrived at Kensal Green. Here he obtained
some breakfast, and mounting the hill turned
off into the fields on the right. Crossing them,
he ascended an eminence, which, from its singular
shape, seems to have been the site of a
Roman encampment, and which commands a
magnificent prospect.</pp></p>
<p>Leaning upon a gate he looked down
into the valley. It was the very spot from
which his poor mother had gazed after her
vain attempt to rescue him at the Mint; 
but, though he was ignorant of this, her
image was alone present to him. He beheld
the grey tower of Willesden Church, embosomed
in its grove of trees, now clothed in all
the glowing livery of autumn. There was the
cottage she had inhabited for so many years,&mdash; 
in those fields she had rambled,&mdash;at that church
she had prayed. And he had destroyed all
this. But for him she might have been alive
and happy. The recollection was too painful,
and he burst into an agony of tears.</p>
<p><pp>Aroused by the sound of the church bells,</pp>
<pb n="233">
<pp>he resolved, at whatever risk, to attend Divine
service. With this view, he descended the
hill, and presently found a footpath leading
to the church. But he was destined to have
every tide of feeling awakened&mdash;every wound
opened. The path he had selected conducted
him to his mother's humble dwelling.
When she occupied it, it was neatness
itself; the little porch was overrun with
creepers&mdash;the garden trim and exquisitely
kept. Now, it was a wilderness of weeds.
The glass in the windows was broken&mdash;the
roof unthatched&mdash;the walls dilapidated. Jack
turned away with an aching heart. It seemed
an emblem of the ruin he had caused.</pp></p>
<p>As he proceeded, other painful reminiscences
were aroused. At every step he seemed to be
haunted by the ghost of the past. There was
the stile on which Jonathan had sat, and he
recollected distinctly the effect of his mocking
glance&mdash;how it had hardened his heart against
his mother's prayer. &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I am severely punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>He had now gained the high road. The</pp>
<pb n="234">
<pp>villagers were thronging to church. Rounding
the corner of a garden wall, he came upon
his former place of imprisonment. Some rustic
hand had written upon the door &ldquo;JACK
SHEPPARD'S CAGE;&rdquo; and upon the wall
was affixed a large placard describing his person,
and offering a reward for his capture.
Muffling up his face, Jack turned away; but
he had not proceeded many steps when he
heard a man reading aloud an account of his
escapes from a newspaper.</pp></p>
<p>Hastening to the church, he entered it by
the very door near which his first crime had
been committed. His mother's scream seemed
again to ring in his ears, and he was so deeply
affected that, fearful of exciting attention, he
was about to quit the sacred edifice, when he
was stopped by the entrance of Thames, who
looked pale as death, with Winifred leaning
on his arm. They were followed by Mr.
Wood in the deepest mourning.</p>
<p><pp>Shrinking involuntarily back into the farthest
corner of the seat, Jack buried his face in his
hands. The service began. Jack who had not</pp>
<pb n="235">
<pp>been in a place of worship for many years was
powerfully affected. Accidentally raising his
eyes, he saw that he was perceived by the
family from Dollis Hill, and that he was an
object of the deepest interest to them.</pp></p>
<p>As soon as the service was over, Thames
contrived to approach him, and whispered, &ldquo;Be
cautious,&mdash;the funeral will take place after
evening service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack would not hazard a glance at Winifred; 
but, quitting the church, got into an
adjoining meadow, and watched the party
slowly ascending the road leading to Dollis
Hill. At a turn in the road, he perceived
Winifred looking anxiously towards him, and
when she discovered him, she waved her hand.</p>
<p>Returning to the churchyard, he walked
round it; and on the western side, near a small
yew&hyphen;tree discovered a new&hyphen;made grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose grave is this?&rdquo; he inquired of a
man who was standing near it.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I can't say,&rdquo; answered the fellow; &ldquo;but
I'll inquire from the sexton, William Morgan.
Here, Peter,&rdquo; he added to a curly&hyphen;headed lad,</pp>
<pb n="236">
<pp>who was playing on one of the grassy tombs,
&ldquo;ask your father to step this way.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>The little urchin set off, and presently returned
with the sexton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's Mrs. Sheppard's grave,&mdash;the mother
of the famous housebreaker,&rdquo; said Morgan,
in answer to Jack's inquiry;&mdash;&ldquo;and it's well
they let her have Christian burial after all
&mdash;for they say she destroyed herself for her
son. The crowner's 'quest sat on her yesterday
&mdash;and if she hadn't been proved out of her
mind, she would have been buried at four
lane&hyphen;ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack could stand no more. Placing a piece
of money in Morgan's hands, he hurried out
of the churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my soul,&rdquo; said the sexton, &ldquo;that's as
like Jack Sheppard as any one I ever seed i'
my born days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastening to the Six Bells, Jack ordered
some refreshment, and engaged a private room,
where he remained till the afternoon absorbed
in grief.</p>
<p><pp>Meantime, a change had taken place in the</pp>
<pb n="237">
<pp>weather. The day had become suddenly overcast.
The wind blew in fitful gusts, and
scattered the yellow leaves from the elms and
horsechestnuts. Roused by the bell tolling for
evening service, Jack left the house. On
reaching the churchyard, he perceived the
melancholy procession descending the hill.
Just then, a carriage drawn by four horses,
drove furiously up to the Six Bells; but Jack
was too much absorbed to take any notice of it.</pp></p>
<p>At this moment, the bell began to toll in a
peculiar manner, announcing the approach of
the corpse. The gate was opened; the coffin
brought into the churchyard; and Jack,
whose eyes were filled with tears, saw Mr.
Wood and Thames pass him, and followed at a
foot's pace behind them.</p>
<p><pp>Meanwhile, the clergyman, bareheaded and
in his surplice, advanced to meet them. Having
read the three first verses of the impressive
service appointed for the burial of the
dead, he returned to the church, whither the
coffin was carried through the south&hyphen;western
door, and placed in the centre of the aisle&mdash;</pp>
<pb n="238">
<pp>Mr. Wood and Thames taking their places on
either side of it, and Jack at a little distance
behind.</pp></p>
<p>Jack had been touched in the morning, but
he was now completely prostrated. In the
midst of the holy place, which he had formerly
profaned, lay the body of his unfortunate mother,
and he could not help looking upon
her untimely end as the retributive vengeance
of Heaven for the crime he had committed.
His grief was so audible, that it attracted the
notice of some of the bystanders, and Thames
was obliged to beg him to control it. In doing
this, he chanced to raise his eyes and half fancied
he beheld, shaded by a pillar at the extremity
of the western aisle, the horrible countenance
of the thieftaker.</p>
<p>Before the congregation separated, the clergyman
descended from the pulpit; and, followed
by the coffin&hyphen;bearers and mourners,
and by Jack at a respectful distance, entered
the churchyard.</p>
<p><pp>The carriage, which it has been mentioned
drove up to the Six Bells, contained four persons,</pp>
<pb n="239">
<pp>&mdash;Jonathan Wild, his two janizaries, and
his porter, Obadiah Lemon. As soon as they
had got out, the vehicle was drawn up at
the back of a tree near the cage. Having
watched the funeral at some distance, Jonathan
fancied he could discern the figure of Jack; but
not being quite sure, he entered the church.
He was daring enough to have seized and
carried him off before the whole congregation,
but he preferred waiting.</pp></p>
<p>Satisfied with his scrutiny, he returned, despatched
Abraham and Obadiah to the north&hyphen;west
corner of the church, placed Quilt behind
a buttress near the porch, and sheltered himself
behind one of the mighty elms.</p>
<p>The funeral procession had now approached
the grave, around which many of the congregation,
who were deeply interested by the
sad ceremonial, had gathered. A slight rain
fell at the time; and a few leaves, caught
by the eddies, whirled around. Jonathan
mixed with the group, and, sure of his prey,
abided his time.</p>
<p><pp>The clergyman, meanwhile, proceeded with</pp>
<pb n="240">
<pp>the service, while the coffin was deposited at
the brink of the grave.</pp></p>
<p>Just as the attendants were preparing to
lower the corpse into the earth, Jack fell on his
knees beside the coffin, uttering the wildest
exclamations of grief, reproaching himself with
the murder of his mother, and invoking the
vengeance of heaven on his own head.</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the assemblage,
by several of whom Jack was recognised. But
such was the violence of his grief,&mdash;such the
compunction he exhibited, that all but one
looked on with an eye of compassion. That
person advanced towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have killed her,&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan, laying a
forcible grasp on his shoulder. &ldquo;You are my
prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack started to his feet; but before he could
defend himself, his right arm was grasped by
the Jew who had silently approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&hyphen;hounds!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;release me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>At the same moment, Quilt Arnold rushed
forward with such haste, that, stumbling</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>425Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010127">
<pb n="241">
<pp>over William Morgan, he precipitated him
into the grave.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Are you not
content with the crimes you have committed,&mdash; 
but you must carry your villany to this point.
Look at the poor victim at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan made no reply, but ordered his
myrmidons to drag the prisoner along.</p>
<p>Thames, meanwhile, had drawn his sword,
and was about to rush upon Jonathan; but
he was withheld by Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not shed more blood,&rdquo; cried the carpenter.</p>
<p>Groans and hoots were now raised by the
crowd, and there was an evident disposition
to rescue. A small brickbat was thrown,
which struck Jonathan in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not pass,&rdquo; cried several of the
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew his poor mother, and for her sake
I'll not see this done,&rdquo; cried John Dump.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Slip on the handcuffs,&rdquo; cried the thieftaker.
&ldquo;And now let's see who'll dare to</pp>
<pb n="242">
<pp>oppose me. I am Jonathan Wild. I have
arrested him in the King's name.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>A deep indignant groan followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see the earth thrown over her,&rdquo; 
implored Jack; &ldquo;and take me where you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; thundered Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow him that small grace,&rdquo; cried Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I tell you,&rdquo; rejoined Jonathan, shouldering
his way out of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother,&mdash;my poor mother!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack.</p>
<p>But, in spite of his outcries and resistance,
he was dragged along by Jonathan and his
janizaries.</p>
<p>At the eastern gate of the church&hyphen;yard stood
the carriage with the steps lowered. The mob
pursued the thieftaker and his party all the way,
and such missiles as could be collected were
hurled at them. They even threatened to cut
the traces and take off the wheels from the carriage.
The Jew got in first. The prisoner was
then thrust in by Quilt. Before Jonathan followed
he turned to face his assailants.</p>
<pb n="243">
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; he cried fiercely. &ldquo;I am an
officer in the execution of my duty. And he
who opposes me in it shall feel the weight of
my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then sprung into the coach, the door
of which was closed by Obadiah, who mounted
the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Newgate,&rdquo; cried Jonathan, putting his
head out of the window.</p>
<p>A deep roar followed this order, and several
missiles were launched at the vehicle, which
was driven off at a furious pace.</p>
<p><pp>And while her son was reconveyed to prison
the body of the unfortunate Mrs. Sheppard
was committed to the earth.</pp></p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Jack Sheppard's</smallcap> escape from Newgate on
the night of the 15th of October was not discovered
till the following morning; for although
the intelligence was brought by several
parties to the Lodge in the course of the night,
Austin, who was the officer in attendance, paid
no attention to them.</p>
<p><pp>After pursuing the fugitive as before related,
Jonathan Wild returned to his own habitation,
where he was occupied during the remainder of
the night with Quilt Arnold and Obadiah Lemon
in removing everything which, in case of a
search, might tend to criminate him. Satisfied
in this respect, he flung himself into a chair,
for his iron frame seldom required the indulgence</pp>
<pb n="245">
<pp>of a bed, and sought an hour's repose
before he began the villanies of another day.</pp></p>
<p>He was aroused from his slumber, about six
o'clock, by the return of Abraham Mendez,
who, not choosing to confess that Jack had
eluded his vigilance, contented himself with
stating that he had kept watch till day&hyphen;break,
when he had carefully searched the field, and,
finding no trace of him, had thought it better
to return.</p>
<p>This information was received by Jonathan
with a lowering brow. He comforted himself,
however, with the certainty which he felt of
capturing his prey on the Sunday. His breakfast
despatched, which he ate with a wolfish
appetite, he walked over to Newgate, chuckling
as he went at the consternation which his
appearance would create amongst the turnkeys.</p>
<p><pp>Entering the Lodge, the first person he beheld
was Austin, who was only just up, and whose
toilette appeared scarcely completed. A glance
satisfied Jonathan that the turnkey was not
aware of the prisoner's escape; and he resolved</pp>
<pb n="246">
<pp>not to destroy what he considered a good jest,
by a premature disclosure of it.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are out betimes this morning, Mr.
Wild,&rdquo; observed Austin, as he put on his coat,
and adjusted his minor bob. &ldquo;Something
fresh on hand, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm come to inquire after Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; 
returned Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't alarm yourself about him, sir,&rdquo; replied
Austin. &ldquo;He's safe enough, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to satisfy myself on that
score,&rdquo; rejoined Wild, drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you shall, sir,&rdquo; replied Austin, who at
this moment recollected, with some uneasiness,
the applications at the lodge&hyphen;door during the
night. &ldquo;I hope you don't imagine anything
has gone wrong, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters not what I think,&rdquo; replied
Wild. &ldquo;Come with me to the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instantly, sir,&rdquo; replied Austin; &ldquo;instantly.
Here, Caliban, attend to the door, and keep the
wicket locked till I return. D'ye hear. Now,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>Taking the keys, he led the way, followed</pp>
<pb n="247">
<pp>by Jonathan, who chuckled internally at the
shock that awaited the poor fellow.</pp></p>
<p>The door was opened, and Austin entered
the cell, when he absolutely recoiled before the
spectacle he beheld, and could scarcely have
looked more alarmed if the prison had tumbled
about his ears. Petrified and speechless, he
turned an imploring look at Wild, who was
himself filled with astonishment at the pile of
rubbish lying before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Sdeath!&rdquo; cried Jonathan, staring at the
breach in the wall. &ldquo;Some one <it>must</it> have
assisted him. Unless he has dealings with the
devil, he could never have done this alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I firmly believe he <it>has</it> dealings with the
devil,&rdquo; replied Austin, trembling from head
to foot. &ldquo;But, perhaps, he has not got beyond
the room above. It's as strong, if not
stronger, than this. I'll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he scrambled over the rubbish,
and got into the chimney. But though the
breach was large enough to admit him below,
he could not squeeze his bulky person through
the aperture into the Red Room.</p>
<pb n="248">
<p>&ldquo;I believe he's gone,&rdquo; he said, returning to
Jonathan. &ldquo;The door's open, and the room
empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe&mdash;you <it>know</it> it,&rdquo; replied Jonathan,
fixing one of his sternest and most searching
glances upon him. &ldquo;Nothing you can say
to the contrary will convince me that you have
not been accessory to his flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sir!&mdash;I swear&mdash;&rdquo; 
<lb>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; interrupted Jonathan, harshly. &ldquo;I
shall state my suspicions to the governor. Come
down with me to the Lodge directly. All further
examinations must be conducted in the
presence of proper witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>With these words, he strode out of the room,
darted down the stone stairs, and, on his arrival
at the Lodge, seized the rope of the great
bell communicating with the interior of the
prison, which he rang violently. As this was
never done, except in some case of great emergency,
the application was instantly answered
by all the other turnkeys, by Marvel, the four
partners, and Mrs. Spurling. Nothing could
exceed the dismay of these personages when</pp>
<pb n="249">
<pp>they learnt why they had been summoned. All
seemed infected with Austin's terrors except
Mrs. Spurling, who did not dare to exhibit her
satisfaction otherwise than by privately pinching
the arm of her expected husband.</pp></p>
<p>Headed by Jonathan, all the turnkeys then
repaired to the upper part of the gaol, and,
approaching the Red Room by a circuitous
route, several doors were unlocked, and they
came upon the scene of Jack's exploits. Stopping
before each door, they took up the plates
of the locks, examined the ponderous bolts,
and were struck with the utmost astonishment
at what they beheld.</p>
<p><pp>Arriving at the chapel, their wonder increased.
All the gaolers declared it utterly
impossible he could have accomplished his
astonishing task unaided; but who had lent
him assistance was a question they were unable
to answer. Proceeding to the entry to
the Lower Leads, they came to the two strong
doors, and their surprise was so great at Jack's
marvellous performance, that they could scarcely</pp>
<pb n="250">
<pp>persuade themselves that human ingenuity
could have accomplished it.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's a door,&rdquo; remarked Ireton, when he
got to that nearest the leads, &ldquo;which I could
have sworn would have resisted anything. I
shall have no faith in future in bolts and
bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mounting the roof of the prison, they traced
the fugitive's course to the further extremity
of the building, where they found his blanket
attached to the spike, proving that he escaped
in that direction.</p>
<p>After severely examining Austin, and finding
it proved, on the testimony of his fellow&hyphen;gaolers,
that he could not have aided Jack in
his flight, Jonathan retracted his harsh sentence,
and even went so far as to say that he would
act as mediator between him and the governor.</p>
<p><pp>This was some satisfaction to the poor fellow,
who was dreadfully frightened, as indeed he
might well be, it being the opinion of the gaolers
and others who afterwards examined the
place, that Jack had accomplished, single&hyphen;handed,
in a few hours, and, as far as it could</pp>
<pb n="251">
<pp>be ascertained, with imperfect implements,
what it would have taken half a dozen men
several days, provided with proper tools, to
effect. In their opinion a hundred pounds
would not repair the damage done to the
prison.</pp></p>
<p>As soon as Jack's escape became known,
thousands of persons flocked to Newgate to
behold his workmanship; and the gaolers reaped
an abundant harvest from their curiosity.</p>
<p>Jonathan, meanwhile, maintained profound
secrecy as to his hopes of capturing the fugitive; 
and when Jack was brought back to
Newgate on the Sunday evening, his arrival
was wholly unexpected.</p>
<p>At a little after five, on that day, four
horses dashed round the corner of the Old
Bailey, and drew up before the door of the
Lodge. Hearing the stoppage, Austin rushed
out, and could scarcely believe his eyes when
he beheld Jack Sheppard in the custody of
Quilt Arnold and Abraham Mendez.</p>
<p><pp>Jack's recapture was speedily made known
to all the officers of the gaol, and the Lodge</pp>
<pb n="252">
<pp>was instantly crowded. The delight of the
turnkeys was beyond all bounds; but poor
Mrs. Spurling was in a state of distraction
and began to abuse Jonathan so violently that
her future husband was obliged to lay forcible
hands upon her and drag her away.</pp></p>
<p>By Wild's command the prisoner was taken
to the Condemned Hold, whither he was followed
by the whole posse of officers and by the
partners; two of whom carried large hammers
and two the fetters. There was only one prisoner
in the ward. He was chained to the
ground, but started up at their approach. It
was Blueskin. When he beheld Jack he uttered
a deep groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of the
bitterest anguish, &ldquo;have these dogs again
hunted you down? If you hadn't been so
unlucky, I should have been with you before
to&hyphen;morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack made no answer, nor did he even cast
his eyes upon his follower. But Jonathan,
fixing a terrible look upon him, cried,</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Ha! say you so? You must be looked</pp>
<pb n="253">
<pp>to. My lads,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the
partners; &ldquo;when you've finished this job give
that fellow a fresh set of darbies. I suspect he
has been at work upon those he has on.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;The link of the chain next the staple is
sawn through,&rdquo; said Ireton, stooping to examine
Blueskin's fetters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search him and iron him afresh;&rdquo; commanded
Jonathan. &ldquo;But first let us secure
Sheppard. We'll then remove them both to
the Middle Stone Hold, where a watch shall
be kept over them night and day till they're
taken to Tyburn. As they're so fond of
each other's society they shan't part company
even on that occasion, but shall swing from
the same tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll never live to see that day,&rdquo; cried
Blueskin, fixing a menacing look upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What weight are these irons?&rdquo; asked Jonathan,
coolly addressing one of the partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than three hundred weight, sir,&rdquo; replied
the man. &ldquo;They're the heaviest set
we have,&mdash;and were forged expressly for Captain
Sheppard.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="254">
<p>&ldquo;They're not half heavy enough,&rdquo; replied
Wild. &ldquo;Let him be handcuffed, and doubly
ironed on both legs; and when we get him into
the Stone Ward, he shall not only be chained
down to the ground, but shall have two additional
fetters running through the main
links, fastened on each side of him. We'll
see whether he'll get rid of his new bonds?&rdquo; 
he added with a brutal laugh, which was
echoed by the bystanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark me,&rdquo; said Jack, sternly; &ldquo;I have
twice broken out of this prison in spite of all
your precautions. And were you to load me
with thrice the weight of iron you have ordered
you should not prevent my escaping a
third time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's right, captain,&rdquo; cried Blueskin.
&ldquo;We'll give them the slip yet, and hang that
butcherly thieftaker upon his own gibbet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent dog,&rdquo; cried Jonathan. And with
his clenched hand he struck him a violent blow
in the face.</p>
<p><pp>For the first time, perhaps, in his life, he
repented of his brutality. The blow was</pp>
<pb n="255">
<pp>scarcely dealt, when, with a bound like that of
a tiger, Blueskin sprang upon him. The
chain, which had been partially cut through,
snapped near the staple. Before any assistance
could be rendered by the gaolers, who
stood astounded, Blueskin had got Wild in
his clutches. His strength has been described
as prodigious; but now, heightened by his
desire for vengeance, it was irresistible. Jonathan,
though a very powerful man, was like
an infant in his gripe. Catching hold of his
chin, he bent back the neck, while with his left
hand he pulled out a clasp knife, which he
opened with his teeth, and grasping Wild's
head with his arm, notwithstanding his resistance,
cut deeply into his throat. The folds
of a thick muslin neckcloth in some degree
protected him, but the gash was desperate.
Blueskin drew the knife across his throat a
second time, widening and deepening the
wound; and wrenching back the head to get
it into a more favourable position, would infallibly
have severed it from the trunk, if the
officers, who by this time had recovered from</pp>
<pb n="256">
<pp>their terror, had not thrown themselves upon
him, and withheld him.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now's your time,&rdquo; cried Blueskin, struggling
desperately with his assailants and inflicting
severe cuts with his knife. &ldquo;Fly,
captain&mdash;fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aroused to a sense of the possibility of
escape, Jack, who had viewed the deadly assault
with savage satisfaction, burst from his
captors and made for the door. Blueskin
fought his way towards it, and exerting all his
strength, cutting right and left as he proceeded,
reached it at the same time. Jack, in
all probability, would have escaped, if Langley,
who was left in the Lodge, had not been alarmed
at the noise and rushed thither. Seeing Jack at
liberty, he instantly seized him, and a struggle
commenced.</p>
<p>At this moment, Blueskin came up, and kept
off the officers with his knife. He used his
utmost efforts to liberate Jack from Langley,
but closely pressed on all sides, he was not able
to render any effectual assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly!&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;escape if you can; 
don't mind me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="257">
<p>Casting one look of anguish at his leader,
Blueskin then darted down the passage.</p>
<p>The only persons in the lodge were Mrs.
Spurling and Marvel. Hearing the noise of the
scuffle, the tapstress, fancying it was Jack
making an effort to escape, in spite of the remonstrances
of the executioner, threw open the
wicket. Blueskin therefore had nothing to stop
him. Dashing through the open door, he crossed
the Old Bailey, plunged into a narrow court
on the opposite side of the way, and was out
of sight in a minute, baffling all pursuit.</p>
<p>On their return, the gaolers raised up Jonathan,
who was weltering in his blood, and who
appeared to be dying. Efforts were made to
staunch his wounds and surgical assistance sent
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he escaped?&rdquo; asked the thieftaker,
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blueskin,&rdquo; said Ireton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;Sheppard?&rdquo; rejoined Wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir,&rdquo; replied Ireton. &ldquo;He's here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; replied Wild, with a ghastly
smile. &ldquo;Remove him to the Middle Stone</pp>
<pb n="258">
<pp>Hold,&mdash;watch over him night and day, do
you mind?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irons&mdash;heavy irons&mdash;night and day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with him to Tyburn,&mdash;never lose sight
of him till the noose is tied. Where's Marvel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; replied the executioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred guineas if you hang Jack Sheppard.
I have it about me. Take it, if I
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, sir,&rdquo; replied Marvel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that I could live to see it,&rdquo; gasped
Jonathan. And with a hideous expression of
pain, he fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's dead,&rdquo; exclaimed Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am content,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;My mother
is avenged. Take me to the Stone Room.
Blueskin, you are a true friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body of Jonathan was then conveyed
to his own habitation, while Jack was taken
to the Middle Stone Room, and ironed in the
manner Wild had directed.</p></div4>

<p>&ldquo;<smallcap>At</smallcap> length this tragedy is at an end,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wood, as, having seen the earth thrown
over the remains of the unfortunate Mrs. Sheppard,
he turned to quit the churchyard. &ldquo;Let
us hope that, like her who &lsquo;loved much,&rsquo; her
sins are forgiven her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word, and accompanied by
Thames, he then took his way to Dollis Hill
in a state of the deepest depression. Thames
did not attempt to offer him any consolation,
for he was almost as much dejected. The
weather harmonized with their feelings. It
rained slightly, and a thick mist gathered in
the air, and obscured the beautiful prospect.</p>
<p><pp>On his arrival at Dollis Hill, Mr. Wood</pp>
<pb n="260">
<pp>was so much exhausted that he was obliged
to retire to his own room, where he continued
for some hours overpowered by grief. The two
lovers sat together, and their sole discourse
turned upon Jack and his ill&hyphen;fated mother.</pp></p>
<p>As the night advanced, Mr. Wood again
made his appearance in a more composed frame
of mind, and, at his daughter's earnest solicitation,
was induced to partake of some refreshment.
An hour was then passed in conversation
as to the possibility of rendering any assistance
to Jack; in deploring his unhappy destiny; 
and in the consideration of the course to be
pursued in reference to Jonathan Wild.</p>
<p>While they were thus occupied, a maid&hyphen;servant
entered the room, and stated that a person was
without who had a packet for Captain Darrell,
which must be delivered into his own hands.
Notwithstanding the remonstrances of Wood
and Winifred, Thames instantly followed the
domestic, and found a man, with his face muffled
up, at the door, as she had described.
Somewhat alarmed at his appearance, Thames
laid his hand upon his sword.</p>
<pb n="261">
<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing, sir,&rdquo; said the man, in a voice
which Thames instantly recognised as that of
Blueskin. &ldquo;I am come to render you a service.
There are the packets which my captain
hazarded his life to procure for you, and which
he said would establish your right to the estates
of the Trenchard family. There are also the
letters which were scattered about Wild's room
after the murder of Sir Rowland. And there,&rdquo; 
he added, placing in his hands a heavy bag of
money, and a pocket&hyphen;book, &ldquo;is a sum little
short of fifteen thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you procured these things?&rdquo; 
asked Thames, in the utmost astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carried them off on the fatal night when
we got into Wild's house, and you were struck
down,&rdquo; replied Blueskin. &ldquo;They have ever
since been deposited in a place of safety. You
have nothing more to fear from Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Thames.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;I have saved the executioner a labour, by
cutting his throat,&rdquo; replied Blueskin. &ldquo;And,
may I be cursed if I ever did anything in</pp>
<pb n="262">
<pp>my whole life which gave me so much satisfaction.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Almighty God! is this possible?&rdquo; exclaimed Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find it true,&rdquo; replied Blueskin.
&ldquo;All I regret is, that I failed in liberating the
captain. If he had got off, they might have
hanged me, and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be done for him?&rdquo; cried
Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's not an easy question to answer,&rdquo; 
rejoined Blueskin. &ldquo;But I shall watch night
and day about Newgate, in the hope of getting
him out. He wouldn't require my aid, but
before I stopped Jonathan's mouth, he had ordered
him to be doubly&hyphen;ironed, and constantly
watched. And, though the villain can't see
his orders executed, I've no doubt some one
else will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Thames. &ldquo;I
would sacrifice all my fortune&mdash;all my hopes
&mdash;to liberate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;If you're in earnest,&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin,
&ldquo;give me that bag of gold. It contains a</pp>
<pb n="263">
<pp>thousand pounds; and, if all other schemes
fail, I'll engage to free him on the way to
Tyburn.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;May I trust you?&rdquo; hesitated Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I not keep the money when I
had it?&rdquo; returned Blueskin, angrily. &ldquo;Not a
farthing of it shall be expended except in the
captain's service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; replied Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have saved his life,&rdquo; replied Blueskin.
&ldquo;And now, mark me. You owe what
I have done for you, to him, not to me. Had I
not known that you and your affianced bride
are dearer to him than life, I should have used
this money to secure my own safety. Take it,
and take the estates, in Captain Sheppard's
name. Promise me one thing before I leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the captain <it>is</it> taken to Tyburn, be near
the place of execution&mdash;at the end of the Edgeware
Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case of need you will lend a helping hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="264">
<p>&ldquo;Swear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; rejoined Blueskin. And he departed,
just as Wood, who had become alarmed
by Thames's long absence, made his appearance
with a blunderbuss in his hand.</p>
<p>Hastily acquainting him with the treasures
he had unexpectedly obtained, Thames returned
to the room to apprize Winifred of
his good fortune. The packets were hastily
broken open; and, while Wood was absorbed
in the perusal of the despatch addressed to him
by Sir Rowland, Thames sought out, and
found the letter which he had been prevented
from finishing on the fatal night at Jonathan
Wild's. As soon as he had read it, he let
it fall from his grasp.</p>
<p>Winifred instantly picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are no longer Thames Darrell,&rdquo; she
said, casting her eyes rapidly over it; &ldquo;but
the Marquis de Chatillon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was of the blood&hyphen;royal of
France,&rdquo; exclaimed Thames.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;Eh&hyphen;day! what's this?&rdquo; cried Wood,</pp>
<pb n="265">
<pp>looking up from beneath his spectacles. &ldquo;Who
&mdash;who is the Marquis de Chatillon?&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your adopted son, Thames Darrell,&rdquo; answered
Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Marchioness is your daughter,&rdquo; 
added Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated Wood. &ldquo;My head
fairly turns round. So many distresses&mdash;so
many joys coming at the same time are too much
for me. Read that letter, Thames&mdash;my lord
marquis, I mean. Read it, and you'll find that
your unfortunate uncle, Sir, Rowland, surrenders
to you all the estates in Lancashire.
You've nothing to do but to take possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange history is mine!&rdquo; said
Thames. &ldquo;Kidnapped, and sent to France by
one uncle, it was my lot to fall into the hands of
another,&mdash;my father's own brother, the Marshal
Gaucher de Chatillon; to whom, and to the Cardinal
Dubois, I owed all my good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ways of Providence are inscrutable,&rdquo; 
observed Wood.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;When in France, I heard from the Marshal
that his brother had perished in London</pp>
<pb n="266">
<pp>on the night of the Great Storm. It was supposed
he was drowned in crossing the river, as
his body had never been found. Little did I
imagine at the time that it was my own father
to whom he referred.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I remember reading something about
your father in the papers,&rdquo; observed Wood.
&ldquo;Wasn't he in some way connected with the
Jacobite plots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; replied Thames. &ldquo;He had been
many years in this country before his assassination
took place. In this letter, which is addressed
to my ill&hyphen;fated mother, he speaks of
his friendship for Sir Rowland, whom it seems
he had known abroad; but entreats her to
keep the marriage secret for a time, for reasons
which are not fully developed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Sir Rowland murdered his friend,&rdquo; 
remarked Wood. &ldquo;Crime upon crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unconsciously, perhaps,&rdquo; replied Thames.
&ldquo;But, be it as it may, he is now beyond the
reach of earthly punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Wild still lives,&rdquo; cried Wood.</p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;He, also, has paid the penalty of his</pp>
<pb n="267">
<pp>offences,&rdquo; returned Thames. &ldquo;He has fallen
by the hand of Blueskin, who brought me these
packets.&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; cried Wood,
heartily. &ldquo;I could almost forgive the wretch
the injury he did me in depriving me of my
poor dear wife&mdash;No, not quite <it>that</it>,&rdquo; be
added, a little confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Thames, (for we must still
preserve the name,) &ldquo;you will no longer defer
my happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; interposed Winifred, gravely. &ldquo;I
release you from your promise. A carpenter's
daughter is no fit match for a peer of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my dignity must be purchased by the
loss of you, I renounce it,&rdquo; cried Thames.
&ldquo;You will not make it valueless in my eyes,&rdquo; 
he added, catching her in his arms, and pressing
her to his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it as you please,&rdquo; replied Winifred.
&ldquo;My lips would belie my heart were I to
refuse you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, father, your blessing&mdash;your
consent?&rdquo; cried Thames.</p>
<pb n="268">
<p>&ldquo;You have both,&rdquo; replied Wood, fervently.
&ldquo;I am too much honoured&mdash;too happy in the
union. Oh! that I should live to be father&hyphen;in&hyphen;law
to a peer of France! What would my
poor wife say to it, if she could come to life
again? Oh, Thames!&mdash;my lord marquis, I
mean&mdash;you have made me the happiest&mdash;the
proudest of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not many days after this event, on a bright
October morning, the bells rang a merry peal
from the old grey tower of Willesden church.
All the village was assembled in the church&hyphen;yard.
Young and old were dressed in their
gayest apparel; and it was evident from the
smiles that lighted up every countenance, from
the roguish looks of the younger swains, and
the demure expression of several pretty rustic
maidens, that a ceremony, which never fails to
interest all classes,&mdash;a wedding,&mdash;was about to
take place.</p>
<p><pp>At the gate opening upon the road leading
to Dollis Hill were stationed William Morgan
and John Dump. Presently, two carriages
dashed down the hill, and drew up before it.</pp>
<pb n="269">
<pp>From the first of these alighted Thames, or,
as he must now be styled, the Marquis de
Chatillon. From the second descended Mr.
Wood&mdash;and after him came his daughter.</pp></p>
<p>The sun never shone upon a lovelier couple
than now approached the altar. The church
was crowded to excess by the numbers eager
to witness the ceremony; and as soon as it
was over the wedded pair were followed to the
carriage, and the loudest benedictions uttered
for their happiness.</p>
<p>In spite of the tumultuous joy which agitated
him, the bridegroom could not prevent
the intrusion of some saddening thoughts, as
he reflected upon the melancholy scene which
he had so recently witnessed in the same place.</p>
<p><pp>The youthful couple had been seated in the
carriage a few minutes when they were joined
by Mr. Wood, who had merely absented himself
to see that a public breakfast, which he
had ordered at the Six Bells for all who chose
to partake of it, was in readiness. He likewise
gave directions that in the after part of
the day a whole bullock should be roasted on</pp>
<pb n="270">
<pp>the green and distributed, together with a
barrel of the strongest ale.</pp></p>
<p>In the evening, a band of village musicians,
accompanied by most of the young inhabitants
of Willesden, strolled out to Dollis Hill, where
they formed a rustic concert under the great
elm before the door. Here they were regaled
with another plentiful meal by the hospitable
carpenter, who personally superintended the
repast.</p>
<p>These festivities, however, were not witnessed
by the newly&hyphen;married pair, who had departed
immediately after the ceremony for
Manchester.</p></div4>

<subhead>HOW JACK SHEPPARD WAS TAKEN TO WESTMINSTER HALL.</subhead> <attbytes>8Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030678</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard. A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><smallcap>Loaded</smallcap> with the heaviest fetters, and constantly
watched by two of the gaolers' assistants,
who neither quitted him for a single
moment, nor suffered any visiter to approach
him, Jack Sheppard found all attempts to
escape impracticable.</p>
<p>He was confined in the Middle Stone Ward,
a spacious apartment, with good light and air,
situated over the gateway on the western side,
and allotted to him, not for his own convenience,
but for that of the keepers, who, if he
had been placed in a gloomier or more incommodious
dungeon, would have necessarily had
to share it with him.</p>
<p><pp>Through this, his last trial, Jack's spirits
never deserted him. He seemed resigned but</pp>
<pb n="272">
<pp>cheerful, and held frequent and serious discourses
with the ordinary, who felt satisfied
of his sincere penitence. The only circumstance
which served to awaken a darker feeling
in his breast was, that his implacable foe
Jonathan Wild had survived the wound inflicted
by Blueskin, and was slowly recovering.</pp></p>
<p>As soon as he could be moved with safety,
Jonathan had himself transported to Newgate,
where he was carried into the Middle Ward,
that he might feast his eyes upon his victim.
Having seen every precaution taken to ensure
his safe custody, he departed, muttering to himself,
&ldquo;I shall yet live to see him hanged&mdash;I
shall live to see him hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Animated by his insatiate desire of vengeance,
he seemed to gain strength daily,&mdash;so
much so, that within a fortnight after receiving
his wound he was able to stir abroad.</p>
<p><pp>On Thursday, the 12th of November, after
having endured nearly a month's imprisonment,
Jack Sheppard was conveyed from Newgate
to Westminster Hall. He was placed in
a coach, handcuffed, and heavily fettered, and</pp>
<pb n="273">
<pp>guarded by a vast posse of officers to Temple
Bar, where a fresh relay of constables escorted
him to Westminster.</pp></p>
<p>By this time, Jack's reputation had risen to
such a height with the populace,&mdash;his exploits
having become the universal theme of discourse,
that the streets were almost impassable
for the crowds collected to obtain a view of
him. The vast area in front of Westminster
Hall was thronged with people, and it was only
by a vigorous application of their staves that
the constables could force a passage for the
vehicle. At length, however, the prisoner
was got out, when such was the rush of the
multitude that several persons were trampled
down, and received severe injuries.</p>
<p><pp>Arrived in the Hall, the prisoner's handcuffs
were removed, and he was taken before
the Court of King's Bench. The record
of his conviction at the Old Bailey
sessions was then read; and as no objection
was offered to it, the Attorney&hyphen;General moved
that his execution might take place on Monday
next. Upon this, Jack earnestly and</pp>
<pb n="274">
<pp>eloquently addressed himself to the bench,
and besought that a petition which he had
prepared to be laid before the King might
be read. This request, however, was refused; 
and he was told that the only way in which
he could entitle himself to his Majesty's clemency
would be by discovering who had
abetted him in his last escape; the strongest
suspicions being entertained that he had not
effected it alone.</pp></p>
<p>Sheppard replied by a solemn assertion,
&ldquo;that he had received no assistance except
from Heaven.&rdquo;&mdash;An answer for which he was
immediately reprimanded by the court. It
having been stated that it was wholly impossible
he could have removed his irons in the
way he represented, he offered, if his handcuffs
were replaced, to take them off in the
presence of the court. The proposal, however,
was not acceded to; and the Chief Justice
Powis, after enumerating his various offences
and commenting upon their heinousness, awarded
sentence of death against him for the following
Monday.</p>
<pb n="275">
<p>As Jack was removed, he noticed Jonathan
Wild at a little distance from him, eyeing
him with a look of the most savage satisfaction.
The thieftaker's throat was bound up
with thick folds of linen, and his face had
a ghastly and cadaverous look, which communicated
an undefinable and horrible expression
to his glances.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mob outside had prodigiously
increased, and had begun to exhibit some
disposition to riot. The coach in which the
prisoner had been conveyed was already broken
to pieces, and the driver was glad to escape
with life. Terrific shouts were raised by the
rabble, who threatened to tear Wild in pieces
if he showed himself.</p>
<p><pp>Amid this tumult, several men armed with
tremendous bludgeons, with their faces besmeared
with grease and soot, and otherwise
disguised, were observed to be urging
the populace to attempt a rescue. They were
headed by an athletic&hyphen;looking, swarthy&hyphen;featured
man, who was armed with a cutlass, which he
waved over his head to cheer on his companions.</pp>
<pb n="276">
<pp>These desperadoes had been the most active
in demolishing the coach, and now, being supported
by the rabble, they audaciously approached
the very portals of the ancient Hall.
The shouts, yells, and groans which they uttered,
and which were echoed by the concourse
in the rear, were perfectly frightful.</pp></p>
<p>Jonathan, who with the other constables had
reconnoitred this band, and recognised in its
ringleader, Blueskin, commanded the constables
to follow him, and made a sally for the
purpose of seizing him. Enfeebled by his
wound, Wild had lost much of his strength,
though nothing of his ferocity and energy,&mdash; 
and fiercely assailing Blueskin, he made a desperate
but unsuccessful attempt to apprehend
him.</p>
<p><pp>He was, however, instantly beaten back; 
and the fury of the mob was so great that it
was with difficulty he could effect a retreat.
The whole force of the constables, gaolers and
others was required to keep the crowd out
of the Hall. The doors were closed and
barricaded, and the mob threatened to burst</pp>
<pb n="277">
<pp>them open if Jack was not delivered to
them.</pp></p>
<p>Things now began to wear so serious an
aspect that a messenger was secretly despatched
to the Savoy for troops, and in half an
hour a regiment of the guards arrived, who
by dint of great exertion succeeded in partially
dispersing the tumultuous assemblage.
Another coach was then procured, in which
the prisoner was placed.</p>
<p>Jack's appearance was hailed with the
loudest cheers, but when Jonathan followed
and took a place beside him in the vehicle,
determined, he said, never to lose sight of
him, the abhorrence of the multitude was expressed
by execrations, hoots, and yells of the
most terrific kind. So dreadful were these
shouts as to produce an effect upon the
hardened feelings of Jonathan, who shrank
out of sight.</p>
<p><pp>It was well for him that he had taken his
place by Sheppard, as regard for the latter
alone prevented the deadliest missiles being
hurled at him. As it was, the mob went on</pp>
<pb n="278">
<pp>alternately hooting and huzzaing as the names
of Wild and Sheppard were pronounced, while
some individuals, bolder than the rest, thrust
their faces into the coach&hyphen;window, and assured
Jack that he should never be taken to
Tyburn.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll see that, you yelping hounds!&rdquo; rejoined
Jonathan, glaring fiercely at them.</p>
<p>In this way, Jack was brought back to Newgate,
and again chained down in the Middle
Ward.</p>
<p>It was late before Jonathan ventured to
his own house, where he remained up all
night, and kept his janizaries and other assistants
well armed.</p></div4>

CHAPTER XXX.
<subhead>HOW JONATHAN WILD'S HOUSE WAS BURNT DOWN.</subhead> <attbytes>9Kb</attbytes><reflink>000027</reflink><comcitn><TY>BOOK</TY><ID>Z400030679</ID><A1>Ainsworth, William Harrison, 1805&ndash;1882</A1><T1>Jack Sheppard. A Romance.</T1><PBL>Richard Bentley</PBL><Y1>1839</Y1><T2>Literature Online</T2></comcitn></comhd4>
<p><smallcap>The</smallcap> day appointed for the execution was
now close at hand, and the prisoner, who seemed
to have abandoned all hopes of escape, turned
his thoughts entirely from worldly considerations.</p>
<p><pp>On Sunday, he was conveyed to the chapel,
through which he had passed on the occasion
of his great escape, and once more took his
seat in the Condemned Pew. The Rev. Mr.
Purney, the ordinary, who had latterly conceived
a great regard for Jack, addressed him
in a discourse, which, while it tended to keep
alive his feelings of penitence, was calculated to
afford him much consolation. The chapel was
crowded to excess. But here,&mdash;even here, the</pp>
<pb n="280">
<pp>demon was suffered to intrude, and Jack's
thoughts were distracted by Jonathan Wild,
who stood at a little distance from him, and
kept his bloodthirsty eyes fixed on him during
the whole of the service.</pp></p>
<p>On that night, an extraordinary event occurred,
which convinced the authorities that
every precaution must be taken in conducting
Jack to Tyburn,&mdash;a fact of which they had
been previously made aware, though scarcely
to the same extent, by the riotous proceedings
near Westminster Hall. About nine o'clock,
an immense mob collected before the Lodge
at Newgate. It was quite dark; but as some
of the assemblage carried links, it was soon
ascertained to be headed by the same party
who had mainly incited the former disturbance.
Amongst the ringleaders was Blueskin,
whose swarthy features and athletic figure
were easily distinguished. Another was Baptist
Kettleby, and a third, in a Dutch dress,
was recognized by his grizzled beard as the
skipper, Van Galgebrok.</p>
<p><pp>Before an hour had elapsed, the concourse</pp>
<pb n="281">
<pp>was fearfully increased. The area in front of
the gaol was completely filled. Attempts were
made upon the door of the Lodge; but it was
too strong to be forced. A cry was then raised
by the leaders to attack Wild's house, and the
fury of the mob was instantly directed to that
quarter. Wrenched from their holds, the iron
palisades in front of the thief&hyphen;taker's dwelling
were used as weapons to burst open the door.</pp></p>
<p>While this was passing, Jonathan opened
one of the upper windows, and fired several
shots upon the assailants. But though he
made Blueskin and Kettleby his chief marks,
he missed both. The sight of the thieftaker
increased the fury of the mob to a fearful degree.
Terrific yells rent the air. The heavy
weapons thundered against the door; and it
speedily yielded to their efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, my lads!&rdquo; vociferated Blueskin,
&ldquo;we'll unkennel the old fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p><pp>As he spoke, several shots were fired from the
upper part of the house, and two men fell mortally
wounded. But this only incensed the assailing
party the more. With a drawn cutlass</pp>
<pb n="282">
<pp>in one hand and a cocked pistol in the other,
Blueskin rushed up stairs. The landing was
defended by Quilt Arnold and the Jew. The
former was shot by Blueskin through the head,
and his body fell over the banisters. The
Jew, who was paralysed by his companion's
fate, offered no resistance, and was instantly
seized.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your accursed master?&rdquo; demanded
Blueskin, holding the sword to his throat.</p>
<p>The Jew did not speak, but pointed to the
audience&hyphen;chamber. Committing him to the
custody of the others, Blueskin, followed by a
numerous band, darted in that direction. The
door was locked; but, with the bars of iron,
it was speedily burst open. Several of the
assailants carried links, so that the room was a
blaze of light. Jonathan, however, was nowhere
to be seen.</p>
<p>Rushing towards the entrance of the well&hyphen;hole,
Blueskin touched the secret spring. He
was not there. Opening the trap&hyphen;door, he then
descended to the vaults&mdash;searched each cell,
and every nook and corner separately. Wild
had escaped.</p>
<pb n="283">
<p>Robbed of their prey, the fury of the mob
became ungovernable. At length, at the end
of a passage, next to the cell where Mrs. Sheppard
had been confined, Blueskin discovered
a trap&hyphen;door which he had not previously
noticed. It was instantly burst open, when
the horrible stench that issued from it convinced
them that it must be a receptacle for the
murdered victims of the thief&hyphen;taker.</p>
<p>Holding a link into the place, which had
the appearance of a deep pit, Blueskin noticed
a body richly dressed. He dragged it
out, and perceiving, in spite of the decayed
frame, that it was the body of Sir Rowland
Trenchard, commanded his attendants to convey
it up stairs&mdash;an order which was promptly
obeyed.</p>
<p><pp>Returning to the audience&hyphen;chamber, Blueskin
had the Jew brought before him. The
body of Sir Rowland was then laid on the
large table. Opposite to it was placed the
Jew. Seeing from the threatening looks of his
captors, that they were about to wreak their
vengeance upon him, the miserable wretch</pp>
<pb n="284">
<pp>besought mercy in abject terms, and charged
his master with the most atrocious crimes.
His relation of the murder of Sir Rowland
petrified even his fierce auditors.</pp></p>
<p>One of the cases in Jonathan's museum was
now burst open, and a rope taken from it. In
spite of his shrieks, the miserable Jew was then
dragged into the well&hyphen;hole, and the rope being
tied round his neck, he was launched from the
bridge.</p>
<p>The vengeance of the assailants did not stop
here. They broke open the entrance into Jonathan's
store&hyphen;room&mdash;plundered it of everything
valuable&mdash;ransacked every closet, drawer,
and secret hiding&hyphen;place, and stripped them of
their contents. Large hoards of money were
discovered, gold and silver plate, cases of
watches, and various precious articles. Nothing,
in short, portable or valuable was left.
Old implements of housebreaking were discovered; 
and the thieftaker's most hidden depositories
were laid bare.</p>
<p><pp>The work of plunder over, that of destruction
commenced. Straw and other combustibles</pp>
<pb n="285">
<pp>being collected, were placed in the middle of
the audience&hyphen;chamber. On these were thrown
all the horrible contents of Jonathan's museum,
together with the body of Sir Rowland Trenchard.
The whole was then fired, and in a
few minutes the room was in a blaze. Not
content with this, the assailants set fire to the
house in half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen other places; and the
progress of the flames was rapid and destructive.</pp></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the object of all this fearful disturbance
had made his escape to Newgate,
from the roof of which he witnessed the destruction
of his premises. He saw the flames
burst from the windows, and perhaps in that
maddening spectacle suffered torture equivalent
to some of the crimes he had committed.</p>
<p>While he was thus standing, the flames of his
house, which made the whole street as light as
day, and ruddily illumined the faces of the
mob below, betrayed him to them, and he was
speedily driven from his position by a shower
of stones and other missiles.</p>
<p><pp>The mob now directed their attention to</pp>
<pb n="286">
<pp>Newgate; and, from their threats, appeared
determined to fire it. Ladders, paviours'
rams, sledge&hyphen;hammers, and other destructive
implements were procured, and, in all probability,
their purpose would have been effected,
but for the opportune arrival of a detachment
of the guards, who dispersed them, not
without some loss of life.</pp></p>
<p>Several prisoners were taken, but the ringleaders
escaped. Engines were brought to
play upon Wild's premises, and upon the adjoining
houses. The latter were saved; but
of the former nothing but the blackened stone
walls were found standing on the morrow.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>The</smallcap> noise of this disturbance did not fail to
reach the interior of the prison. In fact, the
reflection of the flames lighted up the ward in
which Jack Sheppard was confined.</p>
<p><pp>The night before his execution was therefore
passed in a most anxious state of mind; 
nor was his uneasiness allayed by the appearance
of Jonathan Wild, who, after he had been
driven from the roof of the gaol, repaired to
the Middle Stone Ward in a fit of ungovernable
passion, to vent his rage upon the prisoner,
whom he looked upon as the cause of the
present calamity. Such was his fury, that if
he had not been restrained by the presence of
the two turnkeys, he might perhaps have anticipated</pp>
<pb n="288">
<pp>the course of justice, by laying violent
hands upon his victim.</pp></p>
<p>After venting his wrath in the wildest
manner, and uttering the most dreadful execrations,
Jonathan retired to another part of the
prison, where he passed the night in consultation
with the governor, as to the best means of
conveying the prisoner securely to Tyburn.
Mr. Pitt endeavoured to dissuade him from
attending in person, representing the great risk
he would incur from the mob, which was
certain to be assembled. But Jonathan was
not to be deterred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sworn to see him hanged,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and nothing shall keep me away&mdash;nothing,
by &wblank;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By Wild's advice, the usual constabulary
force was greatly augmented. Messengers
were despatched to all the constables and
head&hyphen;boroughs to be in attendance,&mdash;to the
sheriffs to have an extraordinary number of their
officers in attendance,&mdash;and to the Savoy, to obtain
the escort of a troop of grenadier&hyphen;guards.
In short, more preparations were made than if
a state criminal was about to be executed.</p>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>363Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010128">
<pb n="289">
<p>The morning of Monday the 16th of November
1724 at length dawned. It was a dull,
foggy day, and the atmosphere was so thick and
heavy, that, at eight o'clock, the curious who
arrived near the prison could scarcely discern
the tower of St. Sepulchre's church.</p>
<p>By and by the tramp of horses' feet was heard
slowly ascending Snow Hill, and presently a
troop of grenadier guards rode into the area
facing Newgate. These were presently joined
by a regiment of foot. A large body of the constables
of Westminster next made their appearance,
the chief of whom entered the Lodge,
where they were speedily joined by the civic
authorities. At nine o'clock, the sheriffs arrived,
followed by their officers and javelin&hyphen;men.</p>
<p><pp>Meantime, the Stone Hall was crowded by
all the inmates of the gaol, debtors, felons,
turnkeys, and officers who could obtain permission
to witness the ceremony of the prisoner's
irons being struck off. Caliban, who, through
the interest of Mr. Ireton, was appointed to the
office, stood with a hammer in one hand, and a
punch in the other, near the great stone block,</pp>
<pb n="290">
<pp>ready to fulfil his duty. Close behind him
stood the tall gaunt figure of Marvel, with his
large bony hands, his scraggy neck, and ill&hyphen;favoured
countenance. Next to the executioner
stood his wife&mdash;the former Mrs. Spurling. Mrs.
Marvel held her handkerchief to her eyes, and
appeared in great distress. But her husband,
whose deportment to her was considerably
changed since the fatal knot had been tied,
paid no attention whatever to her grief.</pp></p>
<p>At this moment, the bell of Newgate began
to toll, and was answered by another bell from
St. Sepulchre's. The great door of the Stone
Hall was thrown open, and the sheriffs, preceded
by the javelin&hyphen;men, entered the room.
They were followed by Jonathan, who carried
a stout stick under his arm, and planted himself
near the stone. Not a word was uttered by
the assemblage; but a hush of expectation
reigned throughout.</p>
<p><pp>Another door was next opened, and, preceded
by the ordinary, with the sacred volume in his
hand, the prisoner entered the room. Though
encumbered by his irons, his step was firm, and</pp>
<pb n="291">
<pp>his demeanour dignified. His countenance was
pale as death, but not a muscle quivered; nor
did he betray the slightest appearance of fear.
On the contrary, it was impossible to look at
him without perceiving that his resolution was
unshaken.</pp></p>
<p>Advancing with a slow firm step to the
stone&hyphen;block he placed his left foot upon it,
drew himself up to his full height, and fixed a
look so stern upon Jonathan, that the thieftaker
quailed before it.</p>
<p>The black, meantime, began to ply his hammer,
and speedily unriveted the chains. The
first stroke appeared to arouse all the vindictive
passions of Jonathan. Fixing a ferocious
and exulting look upon Jack Sheppard, he exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length, my vengeance is complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Jack, raising his hand in
a menacing manner, &ldquo;your triumph will be
short&hyphen;lived. Before a year has expired, you
will share the same fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, I care not,&rdquo; rejoined Wild; &ldquo;I
shall have lived to see you hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="292">
<p>&ldquo;O Jack, dear, dear Jack!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Marvel, who was now quite dissolved in tears,
&ldquo;I shall never survive this scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, hussy!&rdquo; cried her husband
gruffly. &ldquo;Women ought never to show
themselves on these occasions, unless they can
behave themselves properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, Jack,&rdquo; cried twenty voices.</p>
<p>Sheppard looked round, and exchanged
kindly glances with several of those who addressed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My limbs feel so light, now that my irons
are removed,&rdquo; he observed with a smile, &ldquo;that
I am half inclined to dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll dance upon nothing, presently,&rdquo; 
rejoined Jonathan, brutally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell for ever,&rdquo; said Jack, extending
his hand to Mrs. Marvel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; blubbered the executioner's
wife, pressing his hand to her lips. &ldquo;Here are
a pair of gloves and a nosegay for you. Oh
dear!&mdash;oh dear! Be careful of him,&rdquo; she added
to her husband, &ldquo;and get it over quickly,
or never expect to see me again.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="293">
<p>&ldquo;Peace, fool!&rdquo; cried Marvel, angrily. &ldquo;Do
you think I don't know my own business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Austin and Langley then advanced to the
prisoner, and, twining their arms round his, led
him down to the Lodge, whither he was followed
by the sheriffs, the ordinary, Wild, and
the other officials.</p>
<p>Meantime, every preparation had been
made outside for his departure. At the end
of two long lines of foot&hyphen;guards stood the cart
with a powerful black horse harnessed to it.
At the head of the cart was placed the coffin.
On the right were several mounted grenadiers:
on the left, some half dozen javelin&hyphen;men. Soldiers
were stationed at different points of the
street to keep off the mob, and others were
riding backwards and forwards to maintain an
open space for the passage of the procession.</p>
<p><pp>The assemblage which was gathered together
was almost countless. Every house&hyphen;top,
every window, every wall, every projection,
had its occupants. The wall of St. Sepulchre's
church was covered&mdash;so was the tower. The
concourse extended along Giltspur&hyphen;street as far</pp>
<pb n="294">
<pp>as Smithfield. No one was allowed to pass
along Newgate&hyphen;street, which was barricaded
and protected by a strong constabulary force.</pp></p>
<p>The first person who issued from the Lodge
was Mr. Marvel, who proceeded to the cart,
and took his seat upon the coffin. The hangman
is always an object of peculiar detestation
to the mob, a tremendous hooting hailed his
appearance, and both staves and swords were
required to preserve order.</p>
<p>A deep silence, however, now prevailed,
broken only by the tolling of the bells of Newgate
and St. Sepulchre's. The mighty concourse
became for a moment still. Suddenly, such a
shout as has seldom smitten human ears rent
the air. &ldquo;He comes!&rdquo; cried a thousand
voices, and the shout ascended to Smithfield,
descended to Snow Hill, and told those who
were assembled on Holborn Hill that Sheppard
had left the prison.</p>
<p><pp>Between the two officers, with their arms
linked in his, Jack Sheppard was conducted
to the cart. He looked around, and as he
heard that deafening shout,&mdash;as he felt the influence</pp>
<pb n="295">
<pp>of those thousand eyes fixed upon him,
&mdash;as he listened to the cheers, all his misgivings
&mdash;if he had any&mdash;vanished, and he felt
more as if he were marching to a triumph,
than proceeding to a shameful death.</pp></p>
<p>Jack had no sooner taken his place in the
cart, than he was followed by the ordinary,
who seated himself beside him, and, opening
the book of prayer, began to read aloud.
Excited by the scene, Jack, however, could
pay little attention to the good man's discourse,
and was lost in a whirl of tumultuous emotions.</p>
<p>The cavalcade was now put slowly in motion.
The horse&hyphen;soldiers wheeled round and
cleared a path: the foot closed in upon the
cart. Then came the javelin&hyphen;men, walking
four abreast, and, lastly, a long line of constables,
marching in the same order.</p>
<p><pp>The procession had just got into line of
march, when a dreadful groan, mixed with
yells, hootings, and execrations, was heard.
This was occasioned by Jonathan Wild, who
was seen to mount his horse and join the
train. Jonathan, however, paid no sort of attention</pp>
<pb n="296">
<pp>to this demonstration of hatred. He
had buckled on his hanger, and had two brace
of pistols in his belt, as well as others in his
holsters.</pp></p>
<p>By this time, the procession had reached the
west end of the wall of St. Sepulchre's church,
where, in compliance with an old custom, it
halted. By the will of Mr. Robert Dow,
merchant tailor, it was appointed that the
sexton of St. Sepulchre's should pronounce a
solemn exhortation upon every criminal on his
way to Tyburn, for which office he was to
receive a small stipend. As soon as the cavalcade
stopped, the sexton advanced, and, ringing
a handbell, pronounced the following admonition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<it>All good people pray heartily unto God for
this poor sinner, who is now going to take his
death, for whom this great bell doth toll.</it></p>
<p><pp>&ldquo;<it>You who are condemned to die, repent
with lamentable tears. Ask mercy of the
Lord for the salvation of your own soul,
through the merits of the death and passion
of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand</it></pp>
<pb n="297">
<pp><it>of God, to make intercession for you, if you
penitently return to him. The Lord have
mercy upon you</it>!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>This ceremony concluded, the cavalcade was
again put in motion.</p>
<p>Slowly descending Snow&hyphen;Hill, the train passed
on its way, attended by the same stunning
vociferations, cheers, yells, and outcries, which
had accompanied it on starting from Newgate.
The guards had great difficulty in preserving
a clear passage without resorting to
severe measures, for the tide, which poured
upon them behind, around, in front, and at
all sides, was almost irresistible. The houses
on Snow&hyphen;Hill were thronged, like those in the
Old Bailey. Every window, from the ground&hyphen;floor
to the garret had its occupant, and
the roofs were covered with spectators.
Words of encouragement and sympathy were
addressed to Jack, who, as he looked around,
beheld many a friendly glance fixed upon
him.</p>
<p><pp>In this way, they reached Holborn Bridge.
Here a little delay occurred. The passage</pp>
<pb n="298">
<pp>was so narrow that there was only sufficient
room for the cart to pass, with a
single line of foot&hyphen;soldiers on one side; and,
as the walls of the bridge were covered with
spectators, it was not deemed prudent to cross
it till these persons were dislodged.</pp></p>
<p>While this was effected, intelligence was
brought that a formidable mob was pouring
down Field Lane, the end of which was barricaded.
The advanced guard rode on to
drive away any opposition, while the main
body of the procession crossed the bridge, and
slowly toiled up Holborn Hill.</p>
<p><pp>The entrance of Shoe Lane, and the whole
line of the wall of St. Andrew's church, the
bell of which was tolling, was covered with
spectators. Upon the steps leading to the gates
of the church stood two persons whom Jack instantly
recognised. These were his mistresses,
Poll Maggot and Edgeworth Bess. As soon
as the latter beheld him, she uttered a loud
scream, and fainted. She was caught by
some of the bystanders, who offered her every
assistance in their power. As to Mrs. Maggot,</pp>
<pb n="299">
<pp>whose nerves were more firmly strung,
she contented herself with waving her hand
affectionately to her lover, and encouraging
him by her gestures.</pp></p>
<p>While this was taking place, another and
more serious interruption occurred. The advanced
guard had endeavoured to disperse
the mob in Field Lane, but were not prepared
to meet with the resistance they encountered.
The pavement had been hastily
picked up, and heaped across the end of the
street, upon which planks, barrels, and other
barricades, were laid. Most of the mob were
armed with pikes, staves, swords, muskets, and
other weapons, and offered a most desperate
resistance to the soldiery, whom they drove
back with a shower of paving&hyphen;stones.</p>
<p><pp>The arrival of the cart at the end of
Field Lane, appeared the signal for an attempt
at rescue. With a loud shout, and
headed by a powerfully&hyphen;built man, with a face
as black as that of a mulatto, and armed with
a cutlass, the rabble leapt over the barricades,
and rushed towards the vehicle. An immediate</pp>
<pb n="300">
<pp>halt took place. The soldiers surrounded the
cart, drew their swords, and by striking the
rioters first with the blunt edge of their blades,
and afterwards with the sharp points, succeeded
in driving them back.</pp></p>
<p>Amid this skirmish Jonathan greatly distinguished
himself. Drawing his hanger he rode
amongst the crowd, trampled upon those most
in advance, and made an attempt to seize their
leader, in whom he recognised Blueskin.</p>
<p>Baffled in their attempt, the mob uttered
a roar, such as only a thousand angry voices
can utter, and discharged a volley of missiles
at the soldiery. Stones and brickbats
were showered on all sides, and Mr. Marvel
was almost dislodged from his seat on
the coffin by a dead dog, which was hurled
against him, and struck him in the face.</p>
<p><pp>At length, however, by dealing blows right
and left with their swords, and even inflicting
severe cuts on the foremost of the rabble,
the soldiers managed to gain a clear course,
and to drive back the assailants: who, as they
retreated behind the barricades, shouted in</pp>
<pb n="301">
<pp>tones of defiance, &ldquo;To Tyburn! to Tyburn!&rdquo;</pp></p>
<p>The object of all this tumult, meanwhile,
never altered his position, but sat back in the
cart, as if resolved not to make even a struggle
to regain his liberty.</p>
<p>The procession now wound its way, without
further interruption, along Holborn. Like
a river swollen by many currents, it gathered
force from the various avenues that poured
their streams into it. Fetter Lane, on the
left, Gray's Inn, on the right, added their
supplies. On all hands Jack was cheered, and
Jonathan hooted.</p>
<p><pp>At length, the train approached St. Giles's.
Here, according to another old custom, already
alluded to, a criminal taken to execution
was allowed to halt at a tavern, called
the Crown, and take a draught from St. Giles's
bowl, &ldquo;as his last refreshment on earth.&rdquo; At
the door of this tavern, which was situated on
the left of the street, not more than a hundred
yards distant from the church, the bell of
which began to toll as soon as the procession</pp>
<pb n="302">
<pp>came in sight, the cart drew up, and the whole
cavalcade halted. A wooden balcony in one
of the adjoining houses was thronged with ladies,
all of whom appeared to take a lively interest
in the scene, and to be full of commiseration
for the criminal, not, perhaps, unmixed with
admiration of his appearance. Every window
in the public house was filled with guests; and,
as in the case of St. Andrew's, the church&hyphen;yard
wall of St. Giles's was lined with spectators.</pp></p>
<p>A scene now ensued, highly characteristic of
the age, and the occasion. The doleful procession
at once assumed a festive character.
Many of the soldiers dismounted, and called
for drink. Their example was immediately
imitated by the officers, constables, javelin&hyphen;men,
and other attendants; and nothing was to be
heard but shouts of laughter and jesting,&mdash;nothing
seen but the passing of glasses, and the
emptying of foaming jugs. Mr. Marvel, who
had been a little discomposed by the treatment
he had experienced on Holborn Hill, very
composedly filled and lighted his pipe.</p>
<p><pp>One group at the door attracted Jack's attention,</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>476Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010130">
<pb n="303">
<pp>inasmuch as it was composed of several
of his old acquaintances&mdash;Mr. Kneebone, Van
Galgebrok, and Baptist Kettleby&mdash;all of whom
greeted him cordially. Besides these, there
was a sturdy&hyphen;looking fellow, whom he instantly
recognised as the honest blacksmith who had
freed him from his irons at Tottenham.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here, you see,&rdquo; said the smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I perceive,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>At this moment, the landlord of the Crown,
a jovial&hyphen;looking stout personage, with a white
apron round his waist, issued from the house,
bearing a large wooden bowl filled with ale,
which he offered to Jack, who instantly rose to
receive it. Raising the bowl in his right hand,
Jack glanced towards the balcony, in which the
group of ladies were seated, and begged to drink
their healths; he then turned to Kneebone and
the others, who extended their hands towards
him, and raised it to his lips. Just as he was
about to drain it, he encountered the basilisk
glance of Jonathan Wild, and paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave this bowl for you,&rdquo; he cried, returning
it to the landlord untasted.</p>
<pb n="304">
<p>&ldquo;Your father said so before you,&rdquo; replied
Jonathan, malignantly; &ldquo;and yet it has tarried
thus long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will call for it before six months are
passed,&rdquo; rejoined Jack, sternly.</p>
<p>Once again the cavalcade was in motion, and
winding its way by St. Giles's church, the bell of
which continued tolling all the time, passed the
pound, and entered Oxford Road, or, as it was
then not unfrequently termed, Tyburn Road.
After passing Tottenham Court Road, very few
houses were to be seen on the right hand, and
opposite Wardour Street it was open country.</p>
<p>The crowd now dispersed amongst the fields,
and thousands of persons were seen hurrying
towards Tyburn as fast as their legs could carry
them, leaping over hedges, and breaking down
every impediment in their course.</p>
<p><pp>Besides those who conducted themselves
more peaceably, the conductors of the procession
noticed with considerable uneasiness,
large bands of men armed with staves, bludgeons,
and other weapons, who were flying
across the field in the same direction. As</pp>
<pb n="305">
<pp>it was feared that some mischief would ensue,
Wild volunteered, if he were allowed a
small body of men, to ride forward to Tyburn,
and keep the ground clear until the arrival of
the prisoner.</pp></p>
<p>This suggestion being approved, was instantly
acted upon, and the thieftaker, accompanied
by a body of the grenadiers, rode forward.</p>
<p>The train, meantime, had passed Marylebone
Lane, when it again paused for a moment,
at Jack's request, near the door of a public
house called the City of Oxford.</p>
<p>Scarcely had it come to a halt, when a stalwart
man shouldered his way, in spite of their
opposition, through the lines of soldiery to the
cart, and offered his large horny hand to the
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I would call to bid you farewell,
Mr. Figg,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you did,&rdquo; replied the prize&hyphen;fighter.
&ldquo;Sorry you're obliged to keep your word.
Heard of your last escape. Hoped you'd not
be retaken. Never sent for the shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="306">
<p>&ldquo;I didn't want it,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;but who
are those gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends of yours,&rdquo; replied Figg; &ldquo;come to
see you;&mdash;Sir James Thornhill, Mr. Hogarth,
and Mr. Gay. They send you every good wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer them my hearty thanks,&rdquo; replied
Jack, waving his hand to the group, all of
whom returned the salutation. &ldquo;And now,
farewell, Mr. Figg! In a few minutes, all
will be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Figg turned aside to hide the tears that
started to his eyes,&mdash;for the stout prize&hyphen;fighter,
with a man's courage, had a woman's heart,&mdash; 
and the procession again set forward.</p></div4>

<p><smallcap>Tyburn</smallcap> was now at hand. Over the sea of
heads arose a black and dismal object. It was
the gallows. Jack, whose back was towards it,
did not see it; but he heard, from the pitying
exclamations of the crowd, that it was in view.
This circumstance produced no further alteration
in his demeanour except that he endeavoured
to abstract himself from the surrounding
scene, and bend his attention to the prayers
which the ordinary was reciting.</p>
<p>Just as he had succeeded in fixing his attention,
it was again shaken, and he was almost
unnerved by the sight of Mr. Wood, who was
standing at the edge of a raised platform, anxiously
waving his hand to him.</p>
<p><pp>Jack instantly sprang to his feet, and as his
guards construed the motion into an attempt</pp>
<pb n="308">
<pp>to escape, several of them drew their swords
and motioned to him to sit down. But Jack
did not heed them. His looks were fixed on
his old benefactor.</pp></p>
<p>&ldquo;God in heaven bless you, unhappy boy!&rdquo; 
cried Wood, bursting into tears, &ldquo;God bless
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack extended his hand towards him, and looked
anxiously for Thames; but he was nowhere
to be seen. A severe pang shot through Jack's
heart, and he would have given worlds if he
possessed them to have seen his friend once
more. The wish was vain: and, endeavouring
to banish every earthly thought, he addressed
himself deeply and sincerely to prayer.</p>
<p>While this was passing, Jonathan had
ridden back to Marvel to tell him that all was
ready, and to give him his last instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll lose no time,&rdquo; said the thieftaker.
&ldquo;A hundred pounds if you do it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rely on me,&rdquo; rejoined the executioner, throwing
away his pipe, which was just finished.</p>
<p><pp>A deep dread calm, like that which precedes
a thunder&hyphen;storm, now prevailed amongst the</pp>
<pb n="309">
<pp>assemblage. The thousand voices which a few
moments before had been so clamorous were now
hushed. Not a breath was drawn. The troops
had kept a large space clear around the gallows.
The galleries adjoining it were crowded
with spectators,&mdash;so was the roof of a large
tavern, then the only house standing at the end
of the Edgware Road,&mdash;so were the trees,&mdash; 
the walls of Hyde Park,&mdash;a neighbouring barn,
a shed,&mdash;in short, every available position.</pp></p>
<p>The cart, meantime, had approached the
fatal tree. The guards, horse and foot, and
constables formed a wide circle round it to
keep off the mob. It was an awful moment&mdash; 
so awful, that every other feeling except deep
interest in the scene seemed suspended.</p>
<p>At this terrible juncture, Jack maintained
his composure,&mdash;a smile played upon his face
before the cap was drawn over it,&mdash;and the
last words he uttered were, &ldquo;My poor mother!
I shall soon join her!&rdquo; The rope was then adjusted,
and the cart began to move.</p>
<p>The next instant, he was launched into eternity!</p>
<pb n="310">
<p>Scarcely had he been turned off a moment,
when a man with swarthy features leapt into
the cart with an open clasp&hyphen;knife in his hand,
and, before he could be prevented, severed the
rope, and cut down the body. It was Blueskin.
His assistance came too late. A ball
from Wild's pistol passed through his heart,
and a volley of musketry poured from the
guards lodged several balls in the yet breathing
body of his leader.</p>
<p>Blueskin, however, was not unattended. A
thousand eager assistants pressed behind him.
Jack's body was caught, and passed from hand
to hand over a thousand heads, till it was far
from the fatal tree.</p>
<p><pp>The shouts of indignation&mdash;the frightful yells
now raised baffle description. A furious attack
was made on Jonathan, who, though he defended
himself like a lion, was desperately wounded,
and would inevitably have perished if he had not
been protected by the guards, who were obliged
to use both swords and fire&hyphen;arms upon the mob
in his defence. He was at length rescued from
his assailants,&mdash;rescued to perish, seven months</pp>
<pb>
<edit>[Figure: <bytes>394Kb</bytes>]</edit><figure sys.id="N010131">
<pb n="311">
<pp>afterwards, with every ignominy, at the very
gibbet to which he had brought his victim.</pp></p>
<p>The body of Jack Sheppard, meanwhile, was
borne along by that tremendous host, which rose
and fell like the waves of the ocean, until it approached
the termination of the Edgware Road.</p>
<p>At this point a carriage with servants in
