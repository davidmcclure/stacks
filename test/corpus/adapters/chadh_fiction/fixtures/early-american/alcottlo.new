</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">These</hi> sketches, taken from letters hastily written<lb>
in the few leisure moments of a very busy life, make<lb>
no pretension to literary merit, but are simply a brief<lb>
record of one person's hospital experience. As such,<lb>
they are republished, with their many faults but partially<lb>
amended, lest in retouching they should lose<lb>
whatever force or freshness the inspiration of the time<lb>
may have given them.</p>
<p>To those who have objected to a &ldquo;tone of levity&rdquo; in<lb>
some portions of the sketches, I desire to say that the<lb>
wish to make the best of every thing, and send home<lb>
cheerful reports even from that saddest of scenes, an<lb>
army hospital, probably produced the impression of<lb>
levity upon those who have never known the sharp<lb>
contrasts of the tragic and comic in such a life.</p>
<p>That Nurse Periwinkle gave no account of her<lb>
religious services, thereby showing a &ldquo;sad want of<lb>
Christian experience,&rdquo; can only be explained by the<lb>
fact, that it would have as soon occurred to her to<lb>
print the letters written for the men, their penitent<lb>
confidences, or their dying messages, as to mention<lb>
<pb n="ii">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-015">

<figdesc>Preface. Page ii.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the prayers she prayed, the hymns she sung, the<lb>
sacred words she read; while the &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Christian experience</hi>&rdquo;<lb>
she was receiving then and there was far too<lb>
deep and earnest to be recorded in a newspaper.</p>
<p>The unexpected favor with which the little book<lb>
was greeted, and the desire for a new edition, increase<lb>
the author's regret that it is not more worthy such a<lb>
kind reception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">I want</hi> something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark being addressed to the world in general, no<lb>
one in particular felt it their duty to reply; so I repeated it<lb>
to the smaller world about me, received the following suggestions,<lb>
and settled the matter by answering my own inquiry, as<lb>
people are apt to do when very much in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write a book,&rdquo; quoth the author of my being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't know enough, sir. First live, then write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try teaching again,&rdquo; suggested my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you, ma'am, ten years of that is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a husband like my Darby, and fulfill your mission,&rdquo;<lb>
said sister Joan, home on a visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't afford expensive luxuries, Mrs. Coobiddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn actress, and immortalize your name,&rdquo; said sister<lb>
Vashti, striking an attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go nurse the soldiers,&rdquo; said my young neighbor, Tom, panting<lb>
for &ldquo;the tented field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="004">

</p>
<p>So far, very good. Here was the will, and plenty of it;<lb>
now for the way. At first sight not a foot of it appeared; but<lb>
that didn't matter, for the Periwinkles are a hopeful race.<lb>
Their crest is an anchor, with three cock-a-doodles crowing<lb>
atop. They all wear rose-colored spectacles, and are lineal descendants<lb>
of the inventor of aerial architecture. An hour's<lb>
conversation on the subject set the whole family in a blaze of<lb>
enthusiasm. A model hospital was erected, and each member<lb>
had accepted an honorable post therein. The paternal P.<lb>
was chaplain, the maternal P. was matron, and all the youthful<lb>
P.'s filled the pod of futurity with achievements whose<lb>
brilliancy eclipsed the glories of the present and the past.<lb>
Arriving at this satisfactory conclusion, the meeting adjourned;<lb>
and the fact that Miss Tribulation was available as<lb>
army nurse went abroad on the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>In a few days a townswoman heard of my desire, approved<lb>
of it, and brought about an interview with one of the sisterhood<lb>
which I wished to join, who was at home on a furlough,<lb>
and able and willing to satisfy all inquiries. A morning chat<lb>
with Miss General S.&mdash;we hear no end of Mrs. Generals, why<lb>
not a Miss? &mdash;produced three results: I felt that I could do<lb>
the work, was offered a place, and accepted it, promising not<lb>
to desert, but stand ready to march on Washington at an<lb>
hour's notice.</p>
<p>A few days were necessary for the letter containing my request<lb>
and recommendation to reach headquarters, and another,<lb>
containing my commission, to return; therefore no time was<lb>
to be lost; and heartily thanking my pair of friends, I tore<lb>
home through the December slush as if the rebels were after<lb>
me, and like many another recruit, burst in upon my family<lb>
with the announcement&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've enlisted!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="005">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-018">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>An impressive silence followed. Tom, the irrepressible,<lb>
broke it with a slap on the shoulder and the graceful compliment&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Trib, you're a trump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; then I'll <hi rend="italics">take</hi> something:&rdquo; which I did, in<lb>
the shape of dinner, reeling off my news at the rate of three<lb>
dozen words to a mouthful; and as every one else talked<lb>
equally fast, and all together, the scene was most inspiring.</p>
<p>As boys going to sea immediately become nautical in speech,<lb>
walk as if they already had their &ldquo;sea legs&rdquo; on, and shiver<lb>
their timbers on all possible occasions, so I turned military at<lb>
once, called my dinner my rations, saluted all new comers,<lb>
and ordered a dress parade that very afternoon. Having reviewed<lb>
every rag I possessed, I detailed some for picket duty<lb>
while airing over the fence; some to the sanitary influences of<lb>
the wash-tub; others to mount guard in the trunk; while the<lb>
weak and wounded went to the Work-basket Hospital, to be<lb>
made ready for active service again. To this squad I devoted<lb>
myself for a week; but all was done, and I had time to get<lb>
powerfully impatient before the letter came. It did arrive<lb>
however, and brought a disappointment along with its good<lb>
will and friendliness, for it told me that the place in the Armory<lb>
Hospital that I supposed I was to take, was already<lb>
filled, and a much less desirable one at Hurly-burly House<lb>
was offered instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's just your luck, Trib. I'll take your trunk up<lb>
garret for you again; for of course you won't go,&rdquo; Tom remarked,<lb>
with the disdainful pity which small boys affect when<lb>
they get into their teens. I was wavering in my secret soul,<lb>
but that settled the matter, and I crushed him on the spot<lb>
with martial brevity&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now one; I shall march at six.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>I have a confused recollection of spending the afternoon in<lb>
pervading the house like an executive whirlwind, with my<lb>
family swarming after me, all working, talking, prophesying<lb>
and lamenting, while I packed my &ldquo;go-abroady&rdquo; possessions,<lb>
tumbled the rest into two big boxes, danced on the lids till<lb>
they shut, and gave them in charge, with the direction,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I never come back, make a bonfire of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I choked down a cup of tea, generously salted instead<lb>
of sugared, by some agitated relative, shouldered my knapsack&mdash;<lb>
it was only a traveling bag, but do let me preserve the<lb>
unities&mdash;hugged my family three times all round without a<lb>
vestige of unmanly emotion, till a certain dear old lady broke<lb>
down upon my neck, with a despairing sort of wail&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, my dear, how can I let you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll stay if you say so, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don't; go, and the Lord will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the Roman matron's courage had gone into the<lb>
Yankee matron's composition, and, in spite of her tears, she<lb>
would have sent ten sons to the war, had she possessed them,<lb>
as freely as she sent one daughter, smiling and flapping on the<lb>
door-step till I vanished, though the eyes that followed me<lb>
were very dim, and the handkerchief she waved was very<lb>
wet.</p>
<p>My transit from The Gables to the village depot was a funny<lb>
mixture of good wishes and good byes, mud-puddles and shopping.<lb>
A December twilight is not the most cheering time to<lb>
enter upon a somewhat perilous enterprise, and, but for the<lb>
presence of Vashti and neighbor Tom, I fear that I might<lb>
have added a drop of the briny to the native moisture of&mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;The town I left behind me;&rdquo;</p></q>
though I'd no thought of giving out: oh, bless you, no!<lb>
When the engine screeched &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; I clutched my<lb>

<figdesc>Page 007.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
escort in a fervent embrace, and skipped into the car with as<lb>
blithe a farewell as if going on a bridal tour&mdash;though I believe<lb>
brides don't usually wear cavernous black bonnets and<lb>
fuzzy brown coats, with a hair-brush, a pair of rubbers, two<lb>
books, and a bag of ginger-bread distorting the pockets of the<lb>
same. If I thought that any one would believe it, I'd boldly<lb>
state that I slept from C. to B., which would simplify matters<lb>
immensely; but as I know they wouldn't, I'll confess that<lb>
the head under the funereal coal-hod fermented with all manner<lb>
of high thoughts and heroic purposes &ldquo;to do or die,&rdquo; &mdash;<lb>
perhaps both; and the heart under the fuzzy brown coat felt<lb>
very tender with the memory of the dear old lady, probably<lb>
sobbing over her army socks and the loss of her topsy-turvy<lb>
Trib. At this juncture I took the veil, and what I did behind<lb>
it is nobody's business; but I maintain that the soldier<lb>
who cries when his mother says &ldquo;Good bye,&rdquo; is the boy to<lb>
fight best, and die bravest, when the time comes, or go back<lb>
to her better than he went.</p>
<p>Till nine o'clock I trotted about the city streets, doing those<lb>
last errands which no woman would even go to heaven without<lb>
attempting, if she could. Then I went to my usual refuge,<lb>
and, fully intending to keep awake, as a sort of vigil<lb>
appropriate to the occasion, fell fast asleep and dreamed propitious<lb>
dreams till my rosy-faced cousin waked me with a kiss.</p>
<p>A bright day smiled upon my enterprise, and at ten I reported<lb>
myself to my General, received last instructions and<lb>
no end of the sympathetic encouragement which women give,<lb>
in look, touch, and tone more effectually than in words. The<lb>
next step was to get a free pass to Washington, for I'd no<lb>
desire to waste my substance on railroad companies when<lb>
&ldquo;the boys&rdquo; needed even a spinster's mite. A friend of mine<lb>
had procured such a pass, and I was bent on doing likewise,<lb>
<pb n="008">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-021">

<figdesc>Page 008.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
though I had to face the president of the railroad to accomplish<lb>
it. I'm a bashful individual, though I can't get any one to<lb>
believe it; so it cost me a great effort to poke about the<lb>
Worcester depot till the right door appeared, then walk into a<lb>
room containing several gentlemen, and blunder out my request<lb>
in a high state of stammer and blush. Nothing could<lb>
have been more courteous than this dreaded President, but it<lb>
was evident that I had made as absurd a demand as if I had<lb>
asked for the nose off his respectable face. He referred me<lb>
to the Governor at the State House, and I backed out, leaving<lb>
him no doubt to regret that such mild maniacs were left at<lb>
large. Here was a Scylla and Charybdis business: as if a<lb>
President wasn't trying enough, without the Governor of Massachusetts<lb>
and the Hub of the Hub on top of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never can do it,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;Tom will hoot at you if<lb>
you don't,&rdquo; whispered the inconvenient little voice that is always<lb>
goading people to the performance of disagreeable duties, and<lb>
always appeals to the most effective agent to produce the proper<lb>
result. The idea of allowing any boy that ever wore a<lb>
felt basin and a shoddy jacket with a microscopic tail, to crow<lb>
over me, was preposterous, so giving myself a mental slap for<lb>
such faint-heartedness, I streamed away across the Common,<lb>
wondering if I ought to say &ldquo;your Honor,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;<lb>
and decided upon the latter, fortifying myself with recollections<lb>
of an evening in a charming green library, where I beheld<lb>
the Governor placidly consuming oysters, and laughing<lb>
as if Massachusetts was a myth, and he had no heavier burden<lb>
on his shoulders than his host's handsome hands.</p>
<p>Like an energetic fly in a very large cobweb, I struggled<lb>
through the State House, getting into all the wrong rooms and<lb>
none of the right, till I turned desperate, and went into one,<lb>
resolving not to come out till I'd made somebody hear and<lb>
<pb n="009">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-022">

<figdesc>Page 009.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
answer me. I suspect that of all the wrong places I had<lb>
blundered into, this was the most so. But I didn't care; and,<lb>
though the apartment was full of soldiers, surgeons, starers,<lb>
and spittoons, I cornered a perfectly incapable person, and<lb>
proceeded to pump for information with the following result:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the Governor anywhere about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he wasn't.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he tell me where to look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he couldn't.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know anything about free passes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he didn't.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any one there of whom I could inquire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know of any place where information could be<lb>
obtained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he throw the smallest gleam of light upon the matter,<lb>
in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a ray.</p>
<p>I am naturally iraseible, and if I could have shaken this<lb>
negative gentleman vigorously, the relief would have been<lb>
immense. The prejudices of society forbidding this mode of<lb>
redress, I merely glowered at him; and, before my wrath<lb>
found vent in words, my General appeared, having seen me<lb>
from an opposite window, and come to know what I was about.<lb>
At her command the languid gentleman woke up, and troubled<lb>
himself to remember that Major or Sergeant or something<lb>
Mc K. knew all about the tickets, and his office was in Milk<lb>
Street. I perked up instanter, and then, as if the exertion<lb>
was too much for him, what did this animated wet blanket do<lb>
but add&mdash;</p>
<pb n="010">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-023">

<figdesc>Page 010.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mc K. may have left Milk Street, now, and I<lb>
don't know where he has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; the new comers will know where he has<lb>
moved to, my dear, so don't be discouraged; and if you don't<lb>
succeed, come to me, and we will see what to do next,&rdquo; said<lb>
my General.</p>
<p>I blessed her in a fervent manner and a cool hall, fluttered<lb>
round the corner, and bore down upon Milk street, bent on<lb>
discovering Mc K. if such a being was to be found. He<lb>
wasn't, and the ignorance of the neighborhood was really pitiable.<lb>
Nobody knew anything, and after tumbling over bundles<lb>
of leather, bumping against big boxes, being nearly annihilated<lb>
by descending bales, and sworn at by aggravated<lb>
truckmen, I finally elicited the advice to look for Mc K. in<lb>
Haymarket Square. Who my informant was I've really forgotten;<lb>
for, having hailed several busy gentlemen, some one of<lb>
them fabricated this delusive quietus for the perturbed spirit,<lb>
who instantly departed to the sequestered locality he named.<lb>
If I had been in search of the Koh-i-noor diamond I should<lb>
have been as likely to find it there as any vestige of Mc K.<lb>
I stared at signs, inquired in shops, invaded an eating house,<lb>
visited the recruiting tent in the middle of the Square, made<lb>
myself a nuisance generally, and accumulated fine samples of<lb>
mud from every gutter I fell into. All in vain; and I<lb>
mournfully turned my face toward the General's, feeling that<lb>
I should be forced to enrich the railroad company after all,<lb>
when, suddenly, I beheld that admirable young man, brother-in-law<lb>
Darby Coobiddy, Esq. I arrested him with a burst<lb>
of news, and wants, and woes, which caused his manly countenance<lb>
to lose its usual repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear boy, I'm going to Washington at five, and<lb>
I can't find the free ticket man, and there won't be time to see<lb>
<pb n="011">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-024">

<figdesc>Page 011.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Joan, and I'm so tired and cross I don't know what to do;<lb>
and will you help me, like a cherub as you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. I know a fellow who will set us<lb>
right,&rdquo; responded Darby, mildly excited, and darting into<lb>
some kind of an office, held counsel with an invisible angel,<lb>
who sent him out radiant. &ldquo;All serene. I've got him. I'll<lb>
see you through the business, and then get Joan from the<lb>
Dove Cote in time to see you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I'm a woman's rights woman, and if any man had offered<lb>
help in the morning, I should have condescendingly refused<lb>
it, sure that I could do everything as well, if not better, myself.<lb>
My strong-mindedness had rather abated since then,<lb>
and I was now quite ready to be a &ldquo;timid trembler,&rdquo; if necessary.<lb>
Dear me! how easily Darby did it all: he just asked<lb>
one question, received an answer, tucked me under his arm,<lb>
and in ten minutes I stood in the presence of Mc K., the<lb>
Desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my troubles are over,&rdquo; thought I, and as usual was<lb>
direfully mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to get a pass from Dr. H., in Temple<lb>
Place, before I can give you a pass, madam,&rdquo; answered Mc<lb>
K., as blandly as if he wasn't carrying desolation to my soul.<lb>
Oh, indeed! why didn't he send me to Dorchester Heights,<lb>
India Wharf, or Bunker Hill Monument, and done with it?<lb>
Here I was, after a morning's tramp, down in some place about<lb>
Dock Square, and was told to step to Temple Place. Nor<lb>
was that all; he might as well have asked me to catch a humming-bird,<lb>
toast a salamander, or call on the man in the moon,<lb>
as find a Doctor at home at the busiest hour of the day. It<lb>
was a blow; but weariness had extinguished enthusiasm, and<lb>
resignation clothed me as a garment. I sent Darby for Joan,<lb>
and doggedly paddled off, feeling that mud was my native<lb>
<pb n="012">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-025">

<figdesc>Page 012.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
element, and quite sure that the evening papers would announce<lb>
the appearance of the Wandering Jew, in feminine habiliments.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. H. in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mum, he aint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he wasn't; I knew that before I asked: and,<lb>
considering it all in the light of a hollow mockery, added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will he probably return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the damsel had said, &ldquo;ten to-night,&rdquo; I should have felt a<lb>
grim satisfaction, in the fulfillment of my own dark prophecy;<lb>
but she said, &ldquo;At two, mum;&rdquo; and I felt it a personal insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll call, then. Tell him my business is important:&rdquo; with<lb>
which mysteriously delivered message I departed, hoping that<lb>
I left her consumed with curiosity; for mud rendered me an<lb>
object of interest.</p>
<p>By way of resting myself, I crossed the Common, for the<lb>
third time, bespoke the carriage, got some lunch, packed my<lb>
purchases, smoothed my plumage, and was back again, as the<lb>
clock struck two. The Doctor hadn't come yet; and I was<lb>
morally certain that he would not, till, having waited till the<lb>
last minute, I was driven to buy a ticket, and, five minutes<lb>
after the irrevocable deed was done, he would be at my service,<lb>
with all manner of helpful documents and directions.<lb>
Everything goes by contraries with me; so, having made up<lb>
my mind to be disappointed, of course I wasn't; for, presently,<lb>
in walked Dr. H., and no sooner had he heard my errand,<lb>
and glanced at my credentials, than he said, with the most engaging<lb>
readiness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you the order, with pleasure, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Words connot express how soothing and delightful it was to<lb>
find, at last, somebody who could do what I wanted, without<lb>
sending me from Dan to Beersheba, for a dozen other bodies<lb>
<pb n="013">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-026">

<figdesc>Page 013.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to do something else first. Peace descended, like oil, upon<lb>
the ruffled waters of my being, as I sat listening to the busy<lb>
scratch of his pen; and, when he turned about, giving me not<lb>
only the order, but a paper of directions wherewith to smooth<lb>
away all difficulties between Boston and Washington, I felt as<lb>
did poor Christian when the Evangelist gave him the scroll,<lb>
on the safe side of the Slough of Despond. I've no doubt<lb>
many dismal nurses have inflicted themselves upon the worthy<lb>
gentleman since then; but I am sure none have been more<lb>
kindly helped, or are more grateful, than T. P.; for that short<lb>
interview added another to the many pleasant associations that<lb>
already surround his name.</p>
<p>Feeling myself no longer a &ldquo;Martha Struggles,&rdquo; but a<lb>
comfortable young woman, with plain sailing before her, and<lb>
the worst of the voyage well over, I once more presented myself<lb>
to the valuable Mc K. The order was read, and certain<lb>
printed papers, necessary to be filled out, were given a young<lb>
gentleman&mdash;no, I prefer to say Boy, with a scornful emphasis<lb>
upon the word, as the only means of revenge now left me.<lb>
This <hi rend="smallcaps">Boy,</hi> instead of doing his duty with the diligence so<lb>
charming in the young, loitered and lounged, in a manner<lb>
which proved his education to have been sadly neglected in<lb>
the&mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;How doth the little busy bee,&rdquo;</p></q>
direction. He stared at me, gaped out of the window, ate<lb>
peanuts, and gossiped with his neighbors&mdash;Boys, like himself,<lb>
and all penned in a row, like colts at a Cattle Show. I don't<lb>
imagine he knew the anguish he was inflicting; for it was<lb>
nearly three, the train left at five, and I had my ticket to get,<lb>
my dinner to eat, my blessed sister to see, and the depot to<lb>
reach, if I didn't die of apoplexy. Meanwhile Patience<lb>
certainly had her perfect work that day, and I hope she<lb>
<pb n="014">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-027">

<figdesc>Page 014.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enjoyed the job more than I did. Having waited some twenty<lb>
minutes, it pleased this reprehensible Boy to make various<lb>
marks and blots on my documents, toss them to a venerable<lb>
creature of sixteen, who delivered them to me with such paternal<lb>
directions, that it only needed a pat on the head and an<lb>
encouraging&mdash;&ldquo;Now run home to your Ma, little girl, and<lb>
mind the crossings, my dear,&rdquo; to make the illusion quite perfect.<lb>
</p>
<p>Why I was sent to a steamboat office for car tickets, is not<lb>
for me to say, though I went as meekly as I should have gone<lb>
to the Probate Court, if sent. A fat, easy gentleman gave<lb>
me several bits of paper, with coupons attached, with a warning<lb>
not to separate them, which instantly inspired me with a<lb>
yearning to pluck them apart, and see what came of it. But,<lb>
remembering through what fear and tribulation I had obtained<lb>
them. I curbed Satan's promptings, and, clutching my prize, as<lb>
if it were my pass to the Elysian Fields, I hurried home.<lb>
Dinner was rapidly consumed; Joan enlightened, comforted,<lb>
and kissed; the dearest of apple-faced cousins hugged; the<lb>
kindest of apple-faced cousins' fathers subjected to the same<lb>
process; and I mounted the ambulance, baggage-wagon, or<lb>
anything you please but hack, and drove away, too tired to<lb>
feel excited, sorry, or glad.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">As</hi> travelers like to give their own impressions of a journey,<lb>
though every inch of the road may have been described a<lb>
half a dozen times before, I add some of the notes made by<lb>
the way, hoping that they will amuse the reader, and convince<lb>
the skeptical that such a being as Nurse Periwinkle<lb>
does exist, that she really did go to Washington, and that<lb>
these Sketches are not romance.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">New York Train&mdash;Seven P. M.</hi>&mdash;Spinning along to take<lb>
the boat at New London. Very comfortable; munch ginger-bread,<lb>
and Mrs. C. 's fine pear, which deserves honorable mention,<lb>
because my first loneliness was comforted by it, and pleasant<lb>
recollections of both kindly sender and bearer. Look<lb>
much at Dr. H. 's paper of directions&mdash;put my tickets in every<lb>
conceivable place, that they may be get-at-able, and finish<lb>
by losing them entirely. Suffer agonies till a compassionate<lb>
neighbor pokes them out of a crack with his pen-knife. Put<lb>
them in the inmost corner of my purse, that in the deepest<lb>
recesses of my pocket, pile a collection of miscellaneous<lb>

articles atop, and pin up the whole. Just get composed, feeling<lb>
that I've done my best to keep them safely, when the Conductor<lb>
appears, and I'm forced to rout them all out again, exposing<lb>
my precautions, and getting into a flutter at keeping<lb>
the man waiting. Finally, fasten them on the seat before me,<lb>
and keep one eye steadily upon the yellow torments, till I forget<lb>
all about them, in chat with the gentleman who shares my<lb>
seat. Having heard complaints of the absurd way in which<lb>
American women become images of petrified propriety, if addressed<lb>
by strangers, when traveling alone, the inborn perversity<lb>
of my nature causes me to assume an entirely opposite<lb>
style of deportment; and, finding my companion hails<lb>
from Little Athens, is acquainted with several of my three<lb>
hundred and sixty-five cousins, and in every way a respectable<lb>
and respectful member of society, I put my bashfulness in<lb>
my pocket, and plunge into a long conversation on the war,<lb>
the weather, music, Carlyle, skating, genius, hoops, and the<lb>
immortality of the soul.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Ten, P. M.</hi>&mdash;Very sleepy. Nothing to be seen outside,<lb>
but darkness made visible; nothing inside but every variety<lb>
of bunch into which the human form can be twisted, rolled,<lb>
or &ldquo;massed,&rdquo; as Miss Prescott says of her jewels. Every<lb>
man's legs sprawl drowsily, every woman's head (but mine,)<lb>
nods, till it finally settles on somebody's shoulder, a new proof<lb>
of the truth of the everlasting oak and vine simile; children<lb>
fret; lovers whisper; old folks snore, and somebody privately<lb>
imbibes brandy, when the lamps go out. The penetrating<lb>
perfume rouses the multitude, causing some to start up, like<lb>
war horses at the smell of powder. When the lamps are relighted,<lb>
every one laughs, sniffs, and looks inquiringly at his<lb>
neighbor&mdash;every one but a stout gentleman, who, with wellgloved<lb>
hands folded upon his broad-cloth rotundit, sleeps on<lb>

impressively. Had he been innocent, he would have waked<lb>
up; for, to slumber in that babe-like manner, with a car full<lb>
of giggling, staring, sniffing humanity, was simply preposterous.<lb>
Public suspicion was down upon him at once. I doubt<lb>
if the appearance of a flat black bottle with a label would<lb>
have settled the matter more effectually than did the over dignified<lb>
and profound repose of this short-sighted being. His<lb>
moral neck-cloth, virtuous boots, and pious attitude availed<lb>
him nothing, and it was well he kept his eyes shut, for<lb>
&ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; twinkled at him from every window-pane, brass<lb>
nail and human eye around him.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Eleven, P. M.</hi>&mdash;In the boat &ldquo;City of Boston,&rdquo; escorted<lb>
thither by my car acquaintance, and deposited in the cabin.<lb>
Trying to look as if the greater portion of my life had been<lb>
passed on board boats, but painfully conscious that I don't<lb>
know the first thing; so sit bolt upright, and stare about me<lb>
till I hear one lady say to another&mdash;&ldquo;We must secure our<lb>
berths at once;&rdquo; whereupon I dart at one, and, while leisurely<lb>
taking off my cloak, wait to discover what the second move<lb>
may be. Several ladies draw the curtains that hang in a<lb>
semi-circle before each nest&mdash;instantly I whisk mine smartly<lb>
together, and then peep out to see what next. Gradually, on<lb>
hooks above the blue and yellow drapery, appear the coats<lb>
and bonnets of my neighbors, while their boots and shoes, in<lb>
every imaginable attitude, assert themselves below, as if their<lb>
owners had committed suicide in a body. A violent creaking,<lb>
scrambling, and fussing, causes the fact that people are<lb>
going regularly to bed to dawn upon my mind. Of course<lb>
they are; and so am I&mdash;but pause at the seventh pin, remembering<lb>
that, as I was born to be drowned, an eligible opportunity<lb>
now presents itself; and, having twice escaped a watery<lb>
grave, the third immersion will certainly extinguish my vital<lb>

spark. The boat is new, but if it ever intends to blow up,<lb>
spring a leak, catch afire, or be run into, it will do the deed<lb>
to-night, because I'm here to fulfill my destiny. With tragic<lb>
calmness I resign myself, replace my pins, lash my purse and<lb>
papers together, with my handkerchief, examine the saving<lb>
circumference of my hoop, and look about me for any means<lb>
of deliverance when the moist moment shall arrive; for I've<lb>
no intention of folding my hands and bubbling to death without<lb>
an energetic splashing first. Barrels, hen-coops, portable<lb>
settees, and life-preservers do not adorn the cabin, as they<lb>
should; and, roving wildly to and fro, my eye sees no ray of<lb>
hope till it falls upon a plump old lady, devoutly reading in<lb>
the cabin Bible, and a voluminous night-cap. I remember<lb>
that, at the swimming school, fat girls always floated best, and<lb>
in an instant my plan is laid. At the first alarm I firmly<lb>
attach myself to the plump lady, and cling to her through<lb>
fire and water; for I feel that my old enemy, the cramp, will<lb>
seize me by the foot, if I attempt to swim; and, though I can<lb>
hardly expect to reach Jersey City with myself and my baggage<lb>
in as good condition as I hoped, I might manage to get<lb>
picked up by holding to my fat friend; if not it will be a<lb>
comfort to feel that I've made an effort and shall die in good<lb>
society. Poor dear woman! how little she dreamed, as she<lb>
read and rocked, with her cap in a high state of starch, and her<lb>
feet comfortably cooking at the register, what fell designs<lb>
were hovering about her, and how intently a small but determined<lb>
eye watched her, till it suddenly closed.</p>
<p>Sleep got the better of fear to such an extent that my boots<lb>
appeared to gape, and my bonnet nodded on its peg, before I<lb>
gave in. Having piled my cloak, bag, rubbers, books and<lb>
umbrella on the lower shelf, I drowsily swarmed on to the<lb>
upper one, tumbling down a few times, and excoriating the<lb>

knobby portions of my frame in the act. A very brief nap<lb>
on the upper roost was enough to set me gasping as if a dozen<lb>
feather beds and the whole boat were laid over me. Out I<lb>
turned; and, after a series of convulsions, which caused my<lb>
neighbor to ask if I wanted the stewardess, I managed to get<lb>
my luggage up and myself down. But even in the lower<lb>
berth, my rest was not unbroken, for various articles kept<lb>
dropping off the little shelf at the bottom of the bed, and every<lb>
time I flew up, thinking my hour had come, I bumped<lb>
my head severely against the little shelf at the top, evidently<lb>
put there for that express purpose. At last, after listening to<lb>
the swash of the waves outside, wondering if the machinery<lb>
usually creaked in that way, and watching a knot-hole in the<lb>
side of my berth, sure that death would creep in there as<lb>
soon as I took my eye from it, I dropped asleep, and dreamed<lb>
of muffins.</p>

with tickets, which one man scribbles over, another snips, and<lb>
a third &ldquo;makes note on.&rdquo; Partake of refreshment, in the<lb>
gloom of a very large and dirty depot. Think that my sandwiches<lb>
would be more relishing without so strong a flavor of<lb>
napkin, and my gingerbread more easy of consumption if it<lb>
had not been pulverized by being sat upon. People act as if<lb>
early traveling didn't agree with them. Children scream and<lb>
scamper; men smoke and growl; women shiver and fret;<lb>

porters swear; great truck horses pace up and down with loads of<lb>
baggage; and every one seems to get into the wrong car, and<lb>
come tumbling out again. One man, with three children, a<lb>
dog, a bird-cage, and several bundles, puts himself and his<lb>
possessions into every possible place where a man, three children,<lb>
dog, bird-cage and bundles could be got, and is satisfied<lb>
with none of them. I follow their movements, with an interest<lb>
that is really exhausting, and, as they vanish, hope for<lb>
rest, but don't get it. A strong-minded woman, with a tumbler<lb>
in her hand, and no cloak or shawl on, comes rushing<lb>
through the car, talking loudly to a small porter, who lugs a<lb>
folding bed after her, and looks as if life were a burden to<lb>
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised to have it ready. It is not ready. It must<lb>
be a car with a water jar, the windows must be shut, the fire<lb>
must be kept up, the blinds must be down. No, this won't<lb>
do. I shall go through the whole train, and suit myself, for<lb>
you promised to have it ready. It is not ready,&rdquo; &amp;c., all<lb>
through again, like a hand-organ. She haunted the cars, the<lb>
depot, the office and baggage-room, with her bed, her tumbler,<lb>
and her tongue, till the train started; and a sense of fervent<lb>
gratitude filled my soul, when I found that she and her unknown<lb>
invalid were not to share our car.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Philadelphia.</hi>&mdash;An old place, full of Dutch women, in<lb>
&ldquo;bellus top&rdquo; bonnets, selling vegetables, in long, open markets.<lb>
Every one seems to be scrubbing their white steps.<lb>
All the houses look like tidy jails, with their outside shutters.<lb>
Several have crape on the door-handles, and many have flags<lb>
flying from roof or balcony. Few men appear, and the<lb>
women seem to do the business, which, perhaps, accounts for<lb>
its being so well done. Pass fine buildings, but don't know<lb>
what they are. Would like to stop and see my native city;<lb>
<pb n="021">

for, having left it at the tender age of two, my recollections<lb>
are not vivid.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Baltimore.</hi>&mdash;A big, dirty, shippy, shiftless place, full of<lb>
goats, geese, colored people, and coal, at least the part of it I<lb>
see. Pass near the spot where the riot took place, and feel as<lb>
if I should enjoy throwing a stone at somebody, hard. Find<lb>
a guard at the ferry, the depot, and here and there, along the<lb>
road. A camp whitens one hill-side, and a cavalry training<lb>
school, or whatever it should be called, is a very interesting<lb>
sight, with quantities of horses and riders galloping, marching,<lb>
leaping, and skirmishing, over all manner of break-neck<lb>
places. A party of English people get in&mdash;the men, with<lb>
sandy hair and red whiskers, all trimmed alike, to a hair;<lb>
rough grey coats, very rosy, clean faces, and a fine, full way<lb>
of speaking, which is particularly agreeable, after our slipshod<lb>
American gabble. The two ladies wear funny velvet<lb>
fur-trimmed hoods; are done up, like compact bundles, in tartan<lb>
shawls; and look as if bent on seeing everything thoroughly.<lb>
The devotion of one elderly John Bull to his red-nosed<lb>
spouse was really beautiful to behold. She was plain and<lb>
cross, and fussy and stupid, but J. B., Esq., read no papers<lb>
when she was awake, turned no cold shoulder when she wished<lb>
to sleep, and cheerfully said, &ldquo;Yes, me dear,&rdquo; to every wish<lb>
or want the wife of his bosom expressed. I quite warmed to<lb>
the excellent man, and asked a question or two, as the only<lb>
means of expressing my good will. He answered very civilly,<lb>
but evidently hadn't been used to being addressed by<lb>
strange women in public conveyances; and Mrs. B. fixed her<lb>
green eyes upon me, as if she thought me a forward huzzy, or<lb>
whatever is good English for a presuming young woman. The<lb>
pair left their friends before we reached Washington; and the<lb>
last I saw of them was a vision of a large plaid lady, stalking<lb>
<pb n="022">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-035">

<figdesc>Page 022.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
grimly away, on the arm of a rosy, stout gentleman, loaded<lb>
with rugs, bags, and books, but still devoted, still smiling, and<lb>
waving a hearty &ldquo;Fare ye well! We'll meet ye at Willard's<lb>
on Chusday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after their departure we had an accident; for no long<lb>
journey in America would be complete without one. A coupling<lb>
iron broke; and, after leaving the last car behind us, we<lb>
waited for it to come up, which it did, with a crash that<lb>
knocked every one forward on their faces, and caused several<lb>
old ladies to screech dismally. Hats flew off, bonnets were<lb>
flattened, the stove skipped, the lamps fell down, the water<lb>
jar turned a somersault, and the wheel just over which I sat<lb>
received some damage. Of course, it became necessary for<lb>
all the men to get out, and stand about in everybody's way,<lb>
while repairs were made; and for the women to wrestle their<lb>
heads out of the windows, asking ninety-nine foolish questions<lb>
to one sensible one. A few wise females seized this favorable<lb>
moment to better their seats, well knowing that few men can<lb>
face the wooden stare with which they regard the former possessors<lb>
of the places they have invaded.</p>
<p>The country through which we passed did not seem so very<lb>
unlike that which I had left, except that it was more level and<lb>
less wintry. In summer time the wide fields would have<lb>
shown me new sights, and the way-side hedges blossomed with<lb>
new flowers; now, everything was sere and sodden, and a general<lb>
air of shiftlessness prevailed, which would have caused a<lb>
New England farmer much disgust, and a strong desire to<lb>
&ldquo;buckle to,&rdquo; and &ldquo;right up&rdquo; things. Dreary little houses,<lb>
with chimneys built outside, with clay and rough sticks piled<lb>
crosswise, as we used to build cob towers, stood in barren<lb>
looking fields, with cow, pig, or mule lounging about the door.<lb>
We often passed colored people, looking as if they had come<lb>
<pb n="023">

<figdesc>Page 023.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
out of a picture book, or off the stage, but not at all the sort<lb>
of people I'd been accustomed to see at the North.</p>
<p>Way-side encampments made the fields and lanes gay with<lb>
blue coats and the glitter of buttons. Military washes flapped<lb>
and fluttered on the fences; pots were steaming in the open<lb>
air; all sorts of tableaux seen through the openings of tents,<lb>
and everywhere the boys threw up their caps and cut capers as<lb>
we passed.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Washington.</hi>&mdash;It was dark when we arrived; and, but for<lb>
the presence of another friendly gentleman, I should have<lb>
yielded myself a helpless prey to the first overpowering hackman,<lb>
who insisted that I wanted to go just where I didn't. Putting<lb>
me into the conveyance I belonged in, my escort added<lb>
to the obligation by pointing out the objects of interest which<lb>
we passed in our long drive. Though I'd often been told that<lb>
Washington was a spacious place, its visible magnitude quite<lb>
took my breath away, and of course I quoted Randolph's<lb>
expression, &ldquo;a city of magnificent distances,&rdquo; as I suppose<lb>
every one does when they see it. The Capitol was so like the<lb>
pictures that hang opposite the staring Father of his Country,<lb>
in boarding-houses and hotels, that it did not impress me,<lb>
except to recall the time when I was sure that Cinderella went<lb>
to housekeeping in just such a place, after she had married the<lb>
inflammable Prince; though, even at that early period, I had<lb>
my doubts as to the wisdom of a match whose foundation was<lb>
of glass.</p>
<p>The White House was lighted up, and carriages were rolling<lb>
in and out of the great gate. I stared hard at the famous<lb>
East Room, and would have liked a peep through the crack of<lb>
the door. My old gentleman was indefatigable in his attentions,<lb>
and I said &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; to everything he pointed out,<lb>
though I suspect I often admired the wrong place, and<lb>
<pb n="024">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-037">

</eaffig>
missed the right. Pennsylvania Avenue, with its bustle,<lb>
lights, music, and military, made me feel as if I'd crossed the<lb>
water and landed somewhere in Carnival time. Coming to<lb>
less noticeable parts of the city, my companion fell silent, and<lb>
I meditated upon the perfection which Art had attained in<lb>
America&mdash;having just passed a bronze statue of some hero,<lb>
who looked like a black Methodist minister, in a cocked hat,<lb>
above the waist, and a tipsy squire below; while his horse stood<lb>
like an opera dancer, on one leg, in a high, but somewhat remarkable<lb>
wind, which blew his mane one way and his massive<lb>
tail the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurly-burly House, ma'am!&rdquo; called a voice, startling me<lb>
from my reverie, as we stopped before a great pile of buildings,<lb>
with a flag flying before it, sentinels at the door, and a<lb>
very trying quantity of men lounging about. My heart beat<lb>
rather faster than usual, and it suddenly struck me that I was<lb>
very far from home; but I descended with dignity, wondering<lb>
whether I should be stopped for want of a countersign, and<lb>
forced to pass the night in the street. Marching boldly up the<lb>
steps, I found that no form was necessary, for the men fell<lb>
back, the guard touched their caps, a boy opened the door,<lb>
and, as it closed behind me, I felt that I was fairly started,<lb>
and Nurse Periwinkle's Mission was begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">They've</hi> come! they've come! hurry up, ladies&mdash;you're<lb>
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who have come? the rebels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sudden summons in the gray dawn was somewhat<lb>
startling to a three days' nurse like myself, and, as the thundering<lb>
knock came at our door, I sprang up in my bed, prepared<lb>
<lb>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;To gird my woman's form,</l>
<l>And on the ramparts die,&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
if necessary; but my room-mate took it more coolly, and, as<lb>
she began a rapid toilet, answered my bewildered question,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, no child; it's the wounded from Fredericksburg;<lb>
forty ambulances are at the door, and we shall have<lb>
our hands full in fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we have to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wash, dress, feed, warm and nurse them for the next<lb>
three months, I dare say. Eighty beds are ready, and we<lb>
were getting impatient for the men to come. Now you will<lb>

</eaffig>
begin to see hospital life in earnest, for you won't probably<lb>
find time to sit down all day, and may think yourself fortunate<lb>
if you get to bed by midnight. Come to me in the ball-room<lb>
when you are ready; the worst cases are always carried there,<lb>
and I shall need your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the energetic little woman twirled her hair into a<lb>
button at the back of her head, in a &ldquo;cleared for action&rdquo; sort<lb>
of style, and vanished, wrestling her way into a feminine kind<lb>
of pea-jacket as she went.</p>
<p>I am free to confess that I had a realizing sense of the fact<lb>
that my hospital bed was not a bed of roses just then, or the<lb>
prospect before me one of unmingled rapture. My three<lb>
days' experiences had begun with a death, and, owing to the<lb>
defalcation of another nurse, a somewhat abrupt plunge into<lb>
the superintendence of a ward containing forty beds, where I<lb>
spent my shining hours washing faces, serving rations, giving<lb>
medicine, and sitting in a very hard chair, with pneumonia on<lb>
one side, diptheria on the other, two typhoids opposite,<lb>
and a dozen dilapidated patriots, hopping, lying, and lounging<lb>
about, all staring more or less at the new &ldquo;nuss,&rdquo; who suffered<lb>
untold agonies, but concealed them under as matronly an<lb>
aspect as a spinster could assume, and blundered through her<lb>
trying labors with a Spartan firmness, which I hope they appreciated,<lb>
but am afraid they didn't. Having a taste for<lb>
&ldquo;ghastliness,&rdquo; I had rather longed for the wounded to arrive,<lb>
for rheumatism was n't heroic, neither was liver complaint, or<lb>
measles; even fever had lost its charms since &ldquo;bathing burning<lb>
brows&rdquo; had been used up in romances, real and ideal.<lb>
But when I peeped into the dusky street lined with what I at<lb>
first had innocently called market carts, now unloading their<lb>
sad freight at our door, I recalled sundry reminiscences I had<lb>
heard from nurses of longer standing, my ardor experienced a<lb>
<pb n="027">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-040">

<figdesc>Page 027.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sudden chill, and I indulged in a most unpatriotic wish that I<lb>
was safe at home again, with a quiet day before me, and no<lb>
necessity for being hustled up, as if I were a hen and had<lb>
only to hop off my roost, give my plumage a peck, and be<lb>
ready for action. A second bang at the door sent this recreant<lb>
desire to the right about, as a little woolly head popped in,<lb>
and Joey, (a six years' old contraband,) announced&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Blank is jes' wild fer ye, and says fly round right<lb>
away. They's comin' in, I tell yer, heaps on 'em&mdash;one was<lb>
took out dead, and I see him,&mdash;hi! warn't he a goner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which cheerful intelligence the imp scuttled away,<lb>
singing like a blackbird, and I followed, feeling that Richard<lb>
was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> himself again, and wouldn't be for a long time to<lb>
come.</p>
<p>The first thing I met was a regiment of the vilest odors<lb>
that ever assaulted the human nose, and took it by storm.<lb>
Cologne, with its seven and seventy evil savors, was a posybed<lb>
to it; and the worst of this affliction was, every one had<lb>
assured me that it was a chronic weakness of all hospitals,<lb>
and I must bear it. I did, armed with lavender water, with<lb>
which I so besprinkled myself and premises, that I was<lb>
soon known among my patients as &ldquo;the nurse with the<lb>
bottle.&rdquo; Having been run over by three excited surgeons,<lb>
bumped against by migratory coal-hods, water-pails, and<lb>
small boys, nearly scalded by an avalanche of newly-filled<lb>
tea-pots, and hopelessly entangled in a knot of colored<lb>
sisters coming to wash, I progressed by slow stages up stairs<lb>
and down, till the main hall was reached, and I paused to<lb>
take breath and a survey. There they were! &ldquo;our brave<lb>
boys,&rdquo; as the papers justly call them, for cowards could hardly<lb>
have been so riddled with shot and shell, so torn and shattered,<lb>
nor have borne suffering for which we have no name,<lb>
<pb n="028">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-041">

<figdesc>Page 028.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with an uncomplaining fortitude, which made one glad to<lb>
cherish each like a brother. In they came, some on stretchers,<lb>
some in men's arms, some feebly staggering along propped on<lb>
rude crutches, and one lay stark and still with covered face,<lb>
as a comrade gave his name to be recorded before they carried<lb>
him away to the dead house. All was hurry and confusion;<lb>
the hall was full of these wrecks of humanity, for the most<lb>
exhausted could not reach a bed till duly ticketed and registered;<lb>
the walls were lined with rows of such as could sit,<lb>
the floor covered with the more disabled, the steps and doorways<lb>
filled with helpers and lookers on; the sound of many<lb>
feet and voices made that usually quiet hour as noisy as noon;<lb>
and, in the midst of it all, the matron's motherly face brought<lb>
more comfort to many a poor soul, than the cordial draughts<lb>
she administered, or the cheery words that welcomed all, making<lb>
of the hospital a home.</p>
<p>The sight of several stretchers, each with its legless, armless,<lb>
or desperately wounded occupant, entering my ward,<lb>
admonished me that I was there to work, not to wonder or<lb>
weep; so I corked up my feelings, and returned to the path<lb>
of duty, which was rather &ldquo;a hard road to travel&rdquo; just then.<lb>
The house had been a hotel before hospitals were needed, and<lb>
many of the doors still bore their old names; some not so<lb>
inappropriate as might be imagined, for that ward was in truth<lb>
a <hi rend="italics">ball-room,</hi> if gun-shot wounds could christen it. Forty beds<lb>
were prepared, many already tenanted by tired men who fell<lb>
down anywhere, and drowsed till the smell of food roused<lb>
them. Round the great stove was gathered the dreariest<lb>
group I ever saw&mdash;ragged, gaunt and pale, mud to the knees,<lb>
with bloody bandages untouched since put on days before;<lb>
many bundled up in blankets, coats being lost or useless; and<lb>
all wearing that disheartened look which proclaimed defeat,<lb>
<pb n="029">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-042">

<figdesc>Page 029.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
more plainly than any telegram of the Burnside blunder. I<lb>
pitied them so much, I dared not speak to them, though, remembering<lb>
all they had been through since the fight at Fredericksburg,<lb>
I yearned to serve the dreariest of them<lb>
all. Presently, Miss Blank tore me from my refuge behind<lb>
piles of one-sleeved shirts, odd socks, bandages and lint; put<lb>
basin, sponge, towels, and a block of brown soap into my<lb>
hands, with these appalling directions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear, begin to wash as fast as you can. Tell<lb>
them to take off socks, coats and shirts, scrub them well, put<lb>
on clean shirts, and the attendants will finish them off, and<lb>
lay them in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had requested me to shave them all, or dance a<lb>
hornpipe on the stove funnel, I should have been less staggered;<lb>
but to scrub some dozen lords of creation at a moment's<lb>
notice, was really&mdash;really&mdash;. However, there was<lb>
no time for nonsense, and, having resolved when I came to do<lb>
everything I was bid, I drowned my scruples in my washbowl,<lb>
clutched my soap manfully, and, assuming a business-like<lb>
air, made a dab at the first dirty specimen I saw, bent on<lb>
performing my task <hi rend="italics">vi et armis</hi> if necessary. I chanced to<lb>
light on a withered old Irishman, wounded in the head, which<lb>
caused that portion of his frame to be tastefully laid out like a<lb>
garden, the bandages being the walks, his hair the shrubbery.<lb>
He was so overpowered by the honor of having a lady wash<lb>
him, as he expressed it, that he did nothing but roll up his<lb>
eyes, and bless me, in an irresistible style which was too much<lb>
for my sense of the ludicrous; so we laughed together, and<lb>
when I knelt down to take off his shoes, he &ldquo;flopped&rdquo; also,<lb>
and wouldn't hear of my touching &ldquo;them dirty craters. May<lb>
your bed above be aisy darlin', for the day's work ye are doon!&mdash;<lb>
Whoosh! there ye are, and bedad, it's hard tellin' which is<lb>
<pb n="030">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-043">

<figdesc>Page 030.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the dirtiest, the fut or the shoe.&rdquo; It was; and if he hadn't<lb>
been to the fore, I should have gone on pulling, under the<lb>
impression that the &ldquo;fut&rdquo; was a boot, for trousers, socks,<lb>
shoes and legs were a mass of mud. This comical tableau<lb>
produced a general grin, at which propitious beginning I took<lb>
heart and scrubbed away like any tidy parent on a Saturday<lb>
night. Some of them took the performance like sleepy children,<lb>
leaning their tired heads against me as I worked, others<lb>
looked grimly scandalized, and several of the roughest colored<lb>
like bashful girls. One wore a soiled little bag about his<lb>
neck, and, as I moved it, to bathe his wounded breast, I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your talisman didn't save you, did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon it did, marm, for that shot would a gone<lb>
a couple a inches deeper but for my old mammy's camphor<lb>
bag,&rdquo; answered the cheerful philosopher.</p>
<p>Another, with a gun-shot wound through the cheek, asked<lb>
for a looking-glass, and when I brought one, regarded his<lb>
swollen face with a dolorous expression, as he muttered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vow to gosh, that's too bad! I warn't a bad looking<lb>
chap before, and now I'm done for; won't there be a thunderin'<lb>
scar? and what on earth will Josephine Skinner say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at me with his one eye so appealingly, that I<lb>
controlled my risibles, and assured him that if Josephine was<lb>
a girl of sense, she would admire the honorable scar, as a<lb>
lasting proof that he had faced the enemy, for all women<lb>
thought a wound the best decoration a brave soldier could<lb>
wear. I hope Miss Skinner verified the good opinion I so<lb>
rashly expressed of her, but I shall never know.</p>
<p>The next scrubbee was a nice-looking lad, with a curly<lb>
brown mane, honest blue eyes, and a merry mouth. He<lb>
lay on a bed, with one leg gone, and the right arm so<lb>
shattered that it must evidently follow: yet the little<lb>
<pb n="031">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-044">

<figdesc>Page 031.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sergeant was as merry as if his afflictions were not worth<lb>
lamenting over; and when a drop or two of salt water<lb>
mingled with my suds at the sight of this strong young body,<lb>
so marred and maimed, the boy looked up, with a brave<lb>
smile, though there was a little quiver of the lips, as he<lb>
said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don't you fret yourself about me, miss; I'm first<lb>
rate here, for it's nuts to lie still on this bed, after knocking<lb>
about in those confounded ambulances, that shake what there<lb>
is left of a fellow to jelly. I never was in one of these places<lb>
before, and think this cleaning up a jolly thing for us, though<lb>
I'm afraid it isn't for you ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your first battle, Sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, miss; I've been in six scrimmages, and never got a<lb>
scratch till this last one; but it's done the business pretty<lb>
thoroughly for me, I should say. Lord! what a scramble<lb>
there'll be for arms and legs, when we old boys come out of<lb>
our graves, on the Judgment Day: wonder if we shall get<lb>
our own again? If we do, my leg will have to tramp from<lb>
Fredericksburg, my arm from here, I suppose, and meet my<lb>
body, wherever it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fancy seemed to tickle him mightily, for he laughed<lb>
blithely, and so did I; which, no doubt, caused the new nurse<lb>
to be regarded as a light-minded sinner by the Chaplain, who<lb>
roamed vaguely about, with his hands in his pockets, preaching<lb>
resignation to cold, hungry, wounded men, and evidently<lb>
feeling himself, what he certainly was, the wrong man in the<lb>
wrong place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mrs.!&rdquo; called a voice behind me; and, turning, I<lb>
saw a rough Michigander, with an arm blown off at the shoulder,<lb>
and two or three bullets still in him &mdash; as he afterwards<lb>
<pb n="032">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-045">

<figdesc>Page 032.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
mentioned, as carelessly as if gentlemen were in the habit of<lb>
carrying such trifles about with them. I went to him, and,<lb>
while administering a dose of soap and water, he whispered,<lb>
irefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That red-headed devil, over yonder, is a reb, hang him!<lb>
He's got shet of a foot, or he'd a cut like the rest of the lot.<lb>
Don't you wash him, nor feed him, but jest let him holler till<lb>
he's tired. It's a blasted shame to fetch them fellers in here,<lb>
along side of us; and so I'll tell the chap that bosses this<lb>
concern; cuss me if I don't.</p>
<p>I regret to say that I did not deliver a moral sermon upon<lb>
the duty of forgiving our enemies, and the sin of profanity,<lb>
then and there; but, being a red-hot Abolitionist, stared<lb>
fixedly at the tall rebel, who was a copperhead, in every sense<lb>
of the word, and privately resolved to put soap in his eyes,<lb>
rub his nose the wrong way, and excoriate his cuticle generally,<lb>
if I had the washing of him.</p>
<p>My amiable intentions, however, were frustrated; for, when<lb>
I approached, with as Christian an expression as my principles<lb>
would allow, and asked the question&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I try to make<lb>
you more comfortable, sir?&rdquo; all I got for my pains was a<lb>
gruff &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I'll do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's your Southern chivalry, with a witness,&rdquo; thought<lb>
I, dumping the basin down before him, thereby quenching a<lb>
strong desire to give him a summary baptism, in return for his<lb>
ungraciousness; for my angry passions rose, at this rebuff, in<lb>
a way that would have scandalized good Dr. Watts. He was<lb>
a disappointment in all respects, (the rebel, not the blessed<lb>
Doctor,) for he was neither fiendish, romantic, pathetic, or<lb>
anything interesting; but a long, fat man, with a head like a<lb>

burning bush, and a perfectly expressionless face: so I could<lb>
dislike him without the slightest drawback, and ignored his<lb>
existence from that day forth. One redeeming trait he certainly<lb>
did possess, as the floor speedily testified; for his ablutions<lb>
were so vigorously performed, that his bed soon stood like an<lb>
isolated island, in a sea of soap-suds, and he resembled a<lb>
dripping merman, suffering from the loss of a fin. If cleanliness<lb>
is a near neighbor to godliness, then was the big rebel<lb>
the godliest man in my ward that day.</p>
<p>Having done up our human wash, and laid it out to dry, the<lb>
second syllable of our version of the word War-fare was enacted<lb>
with much success. Great trays of bread, meat, soup and<lb>
coffee appeared; and both nurses and attendants turned<lb>
waiters, serving bountiful rations to all who could eat. I can<lb>
call my pinafore to testify to my good will in the work, for in<lb>
ten minutes it was reduced to a perambulating bill of fare, presenting<lb>
samples of all the refreshments going or gone. It was<lb>
a lively scene; the long room lined with rows of beds, each<lb>
filled by an occupant, whom water, shears, and clean raiment,<lb>
had transformed from a dismal ragamuffin into a recumbent<lb>
hero, with a cropped head. To and fro rushed matrons, maids,<lb>
and convalescent &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; skirmishing with knives and forks;<lb>
retreating with empty plates; marching and counter-marching,<lb>
with unvaried success, while the clash of busy spoons made<lb>
most inspiring music for the charge of our Light Brigade:</p>

<p>Very welcome seemed the generous meal, after a week of<lb>
suffering, exposure, and short commons; soon the brown faces<lb>
began to smile, as food, warmth, and rest, did their pleasant<lb>
work; and the grateful &ldquo;Thankee's&rdquo; were followed by more<lb>
graphic accounts of the battle and retreat, than any paid<lb>
reporter could have given us. Curious contrasts of the tragic<lb>
and comic met one everywhere; and some touching as well as<lb>
ludicrous episodes, might have been recorded that day. A<lb>
six foot New Hampshire man, with a leg broken and perforated<lb>
by a piece of shell, so large that, had I not seen the wound, I<lb>
should have regarded the story as a Munchausenism, beckoned<lb>
me to come and help him, as he could not sit up, and both his<lb>
bed and beard were getting plentifully anointed with soup.<lb>
As I fed my big nestling with corresponding mouthfuls, I<lb>
asked him how he felt during the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, 'twas my fust, you see, so I aint ashamed to say I<lb>
was a trifle flustered in the beginnin', there was such an allfired<lb>
racket; for ef there's anything I do spleen agin, it's noise.<lb>
But when my mate, Eph Sylvester, fell, with a bullet through<lb>
his head, I got mad, and pitched in, licketty cut. Our part<lb>
of the fight didn't last long; so a lot of us larked round<lb>
Fredericksburg, and give some of them houses a pretty consid'able<lb>
of a rummage, till we was ordered out of the mess.<lb>
Some of our fellows cut like time; but I warn't a-goin to run<lb>
for nobody; and, fust thing I knew, a shell bust, right in<lb>
front of us, and I keeled over, feelin' as if I was blowed<lb>
higher'n a kite. I sung out, and the boys come back for me,<lb>
double quick; but the way they chucked me over them fences<lb>
was a caution, I tell you. Next day I was most as black as<lb>
that darkey yonder, lickin' plates on the sly. This is bully<lb>
coffee, ain't it? Give us another pull at it, and I'll be obleeged<lb>
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did; and, as the last gulp subsided, he said, with a rub<lb>
of his old handkerchief over eyes as well as mouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a here; I've got a pair a earbobs and a handkercher<lb>
pin I'm a goin' to give you, if you'll have them; for you're<lb>
the very moral o' Lizy Sylvester, poor Eph's wife: that's why<lb>
I signalled you to come over here. They aint much, I guess,<lb>
but they'll do to memorize the rebs by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burrowing under his pillow, he produced a little bundle of<lb>
what he called &ldquo;truck,&rdquo; and gallantly presented me with a<lb>
pair of earrings, each representing a cluster of corpulent<lb>
grapes, and the pin a basket of astonishing fruit, the whole<lb>
large and coppery enough for a small warming-pan. Feeling<lb>
delicate about depriving him of such valuable relics, I accepted<lb>
the earrings alone, and was obliged to depart, somewhat<lb>
abruptly, when my friend stuck the warming-pan in the bosom<lb>
of his night-gown, viewing it with much complacency, and,<lb>
perhaps, some tender memory, in that rough heart of his, for<lb>
the comrade he had lost.</p>
<p>Observing that the man next him had left his meal untouched,<lb>
I offered the same service I had performed for his neighbor,<lb>
but he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma'am; I don't think I'll ever eat again, for<lb>
I'm shot in the stomach. But I'd like a drink of water, if<lb>
you aint too busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rushed away, but the water-pails were gone to be refilled,<lb>
and it was some time before they reappeared. I did not forget<lb>
my patient patient, meanwhile, and, with the first mugful,<lb>
hurried back to him. He seemed asleep; but something in<lb>
the tired white face caused me to listen at his lips for a breath.<lb>
None came. I touched his forehead; it was cold: and then I<lb>
knew that, while he waited, a better nurse than I had given<lb>
him a cooler draught, and healed him with a touch. I laid<lb>

</eaffig>
the sheet over the quiet sleeper, whom no noise could now<lb>
disturb; and, half an hour later, the bed was empty. It<lb>
seemed a poor requital for all he had sacrificed and suffered,&mdash;<lb>
that hospital bed, lonely even in a crowd; for there was no<lb>
familiar face for him to look his last upon; no friendly voice<lb>
to say, Good bye; no hand to lead him gently down into the<lb>
Valley of the Shadow; and he vanished, like a drop in that<lb>
red sea upon whose shores so many women stand lamenting.<lb>
For a moment I felt bitterly indignant at this seeming carelessness<lb>
of the value of life, the sanctity of death; then consoled<lb>
myself with the thought that, when the great muster<lb>
roll was called, these nameless men might be promoted above<lb>
many whose tall monuments record the barren honors they<lb>
have won.</p>
<p>All having eaten, drank, and rested, the surgeons began<lb>
their rounds; and I took my first lesson in the art of dressing<lb>
wounds. It wasn't a festive scene, by any means; for Dr.<lb>
P., whose Aid I constituted myself, fell to work with a vigor<lb>
which soon convinced me that I was a weaker vessel, though<lb>
nothing would have induced me to confess it then. He had<lb>
served in the Crimea, and seemed to regard a dilapidated body<lb>
very much as I should have regarded a damaged garment;<lb>
and, turning up his cuffs, whipped out a very unpleasant looking<lb>
housewife, cutting, sawing, patching and piecing, with the<lb>
enthusiasm of an accomplished surgical seamstress; explaining<lb>
the process, in scientific terms, to the patient, meantime;<lb>
which, of course, was immensely cheering and comfortable.<lb>
There was an uncanny sort of fascination in watching him, as<lb>
he peered and probed into the mechanism of those wonderful<lb>
bodies, whose mysteries he understood so well. The more<lb>
intricate the wound, the better he liked it. A poor private,<lb>
with both legs off, and shot through the lungs, possessed more<lb>
<pb n="037">

</eaffig>
attractions for him than a dozen generals, slightly scratched in<lb>
some &ldquo;masterly retreat;&rdquo; and had any one appeared in small<lb>
pieces, requesting to be put together again, he would have<lb>
considered it a special dispensation.</p>
<p>The amputations were reserved till the morrow, and the<lb>
merciful magic of ether was not thought necessary that day, so<lb>
the poor souls had to bear their pains as best they might. It<lb>
is all very well to talk of the patience of woman; and far be<lb>
it from me to pluck that feather from her cap, for, heaven<lb>
knows, she isn't allowed to wear many; but the patient<lb>
endurance of these men, under trials of the flesh, was truly<lb>
wonderful. Their fortitude seemed contagious, and scarcely a<lb>
cry escaped them, though I often longed to groan for them,<lb>
when pride kept their white lips shut, while great drops stood<lb>
upon their foreheads, and the bed shook with the irrepressible<lb>
tremor of their tortured bodies. One or two Irishmen anathematized<lb>
the doctors with the frankness of their nation, and<lb>
ordered the Virgin to stand by them, as if she had been the<lb>
wedded Biddy to whom they could administer the poker, if<lb>
she didn't; but, as a general thing, the work went on in<lb>
silence, broken only by some quiet request for roller, instruments,<lb>
or plaster, a sigh from the patient, or a sympathizing<lb>
murmur from the nurse.</p>
<p>It was long past noon before these repairs were even partially<lb>
made; and, having got the bodies of my boys into something<lb>
like order, the next task was to minister to their minds,<lb>
by writing letters to the anxious souls at home; answering<lb>
questions, reading papers, taking possession of money and<lb>
valuables; for the eighth commandmnnt was reduced to a<lb>
very fragmentary condition, both by the blacks and whites,<lb>
who ornamented our hospital with their presence. Pocket<lb>
books, purses, miniatures, and watches, were sealed up,<lb>
<pb n="038">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-051">

<figdesc>Page 038.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
labelled, and handed over to the matron, till such times as the<lb>
owners thereof were ready to depart homeward or campward<lb>
again. The letters dictated to me, and revised by me, that<lb>
afternoon, would have made an excellent chapter for some<lb>
future history of the war; for, like that which Thackeray's<lb>
&ldquo;Ensign Spooney&rdquo; wrote his mother just before Waterloo,<lb>
they were &ldquo;full of affection, pluck, and bad spelling;&rdquo; nearly<lb>
all giving lively accounts of the battle, and ending with a<lb>
somewhat sudden plunge from patriotism to provender, desiring<lb>
&ldquo;Marm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mary Ann,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aunt Peters,&rdquo; to send<lb>
along some pies, pickles, sweet stuff, and apples, &ldquo;to yourn in<lb>
haste,&rdquo; Joe, Sam, or Ned, as the case might be.</p>
<p>My little Sergeant insisted on trying to scribble something<lb>
with his left hand, and patiently accomplished some half dozen<lb>
lines of hieroglyphies, which he gave me to fold and direct,<lb>
with a boyish blush, that rendered a glimpse of &ldquo;My Dearest<lb>
Jane,&rdquo; unnecessary, to assure me that the heroic lad had been<lb>
more successful in the service of Commander-in-Chief Cupid<lb>
than that of Gen. Mars; and a charming little romance blossomed<lb>
instanter in Nurse Periwinkle's romantic fancy, though<lb>
no further confidences were made that day, for Sergeant fell<lb>
asleep, and, judging from his tranquil face, visited his absent<lb>
sweetheart in the pleasant land of dreams.</p>
<p>At five o'clock a great bell rang, and the attendants flew,<lb>
not to arms, but to their trays, to bring up supper, when a<lb>
second uproar announced that it was ready. The new comers<lb>
woke at the sound; and I presently discovered that it took a<lb>
very bad wound to incapacitate the defenders of the faith for<lb>
the consumption of their rations; the amount that some of<lb>
them sequestered was amazing; but when I suggested the<lb>
probability of a famine hereafter, to the matron, that motherly<lb>
lady cried out: &ldquo;Bless their hearts, why shouldn't they eat?<lb>
<pb n="039">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-052">

It's their only amusement; so fill every one, and, if there's<lb>
not enough ready to-night, I'll lend my share to the Lord by<lb>
giving it to the boys.&rdquo; And, whipping up her coffee-pot and<lb>
plate of toast, she gladdened the eyes and stomachs of two or<lb>
three dissatisfied heroes, by serving them with a liberal hand;<lb>
and I haven't the slightest doubt that, having cast her bread<lb>
upon the waters, it came back buttered, as another large-hearted<lb>
old lady was wont to say.</p>
<p>Then came the doctor's evening visit; the administration of<lb>
medicines; washing feverish faces; smoothing tumbled beds;<lb>
wetting wounds; singing lullabies; and preparations for the<lb>
night. By twelve, the last labor of love was done; the last<lb>
&ldquo;good night&rdquo; spoken; and, if any needed a reward for that<lb>
day's work, they surely received it, in the silent eloquence of<lb>
those long lines of faces, showing pale and peaceful in the<lb>
shaded rooms, as we quitted them, followed by grateful glances<lb>
that lighted us to bed, where rest, the sweetest, made our pillows<lb>
soft, while Night and Nature took our places, filling that<lb>
great house of pain with the healing miracles of Sleep, and<lb>
his diviner brother, Death.</p>

<p>Being fond of the night side of nature, I was soon promoted<lb>
to the post of night nurse, with every facility for indulging in<lb>
my favorite pastime of &ldquo;owling.&rdquo; My colleague, a blackeyed<lb>
widow, relieved me at dawn, we two taking care of<lb>
the ward between us, like regular nurses, turn and turn<lb>
about. I usually found my boys in the jolliest state of<lb>
mind their condition allowed; for it was a known fact that<lb>
Nurse Periwinkle objected to blue devils, and entertained a<lb>
belief that he who laughed most was surest of recovery. At<lb>
the beginning of my reign, dumps and dismals prevailed; the<lb>
nurses looked anxious and tired, the men gloomy or sad; and a<lb>
general &ldquo;Hark! from-the-tombs-a-doleful-sound&rdquo; style of conversation<lb>
seemed to be the fashion: a state of things which<lb>
caused one coming from a merry, social New England town, to<lb>
feel as if she had got into an exhausted receiver; and the<lb>
instinct of self-preservation, to say nothing of a philanthropic<lb>
desire to serve the race, caused a speedy change in Ward<lb>
No. 1.</p>

<p>More flattering than the most gracefully turned compliment,<lb>
more grateful than the most admiring glance, was the sight of<lb>
those rows of faces, all strange to me a little while ago, now<lb>
lighting up, with smiles of welcome, as I came among them,<lb>
enjoying that moment heartily, with a womanly pride in their<lb>
regard, a motherly affection for them all. The evenings were<lb>
spent in reading aloud, writing letters, waiting on and amusing<lb>
the men, going the rounds with Dr. P., as he made his second<lb>
daily survey, dressing my dozen wounds afresh, giving last<lb>
doses, and making them cozy for the long hours to come, till<lb>
the nine o'clock bell rang, the gas was turned down, the day<lb>
nurses went off duty, the night watch came on, and my nocturnal<lb>
adventures began.</p>
<p>My ward was now divided into three rooms; and, under<lb>
favor of the matron, I had managed to sort out the patients in<lb>
such a way that I had what I called, &ldquo;my duty room,&rdquo; my<lb>
&ldquo;pleasure room,&rdquo; and my &ldquo;pathetic room,&rdquo; and worked for<lb>
each in a different way. One, I visited, armed with a dressing<lb>
tray, full of rollers, plasters, and pins; another, with books,<lb>
flowers, games, and gossip; a third, with teapots, lullabies,<lb>
consolation, and, sometimes, a shroud.</p>
<p>Wherever the sickest or most helpless man chanced to be,<lb>
there I held my watch, often visiting the other rooms, to see<lb>
that the general watchman of the ward did his duty by the<lb>
fires and the wounds, the latter needing constant wetting.<lb>
Not only on this account did I meander, but also to get fresher<lb>
air than the close rooms afforded; for, owing to the stupidity<lb>
of that mysterious &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; who does all the damage<lb>
in the world, the windows had been carefully nailed down<lb>
above, and the lower sashes could only be raised in the mildest<lb>
weather, for the men lay just below. I had suggested a summary<lb>
smashing of a few panes here and there, when frequent<lb>
<pb n="042">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-055">

<figdesc>Page 042.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
appeals to headquarters had proved unavailing, and daily<lb>
orders to lazy attendants had come to nothing. No one seconded<lb>
the motion, however, and the nails were far beyond my<lb>
reach; for, though belonging to the sisterhood of &ldquo;ministering<lb>
angels,&rdquo; I had no wings, and might as well have asked for<lb>
a suspension bridge, as a pair of steps, in that charitable<lb>
chaos.</p>
<p>One of the harmless ghosts who bore me company during<lb>
the haunted hours, was Dan, the watchman, whom I regarded<lb>
with a certain awe; for, though so much together, I never<lb>
fairly saw his face, and, but for his legs, should never have<lb>
recognized him, as we seldom met by day. These legs were<lb>
remarkable, as was his whole figure, for his body was short,<lb>
rotund, and done up in a big jacket, and muffler; his beard<lb>
hid the lower part of his face, his hat-brim the upper; and all<lb>
I ever discovered was a pair of sleepy eyes, and a very mild<lb>
voice. But the legs! &mdash; very long, very thin, very crooked<lb>
and feeble, looking like gray sausages in their tight coverings,<lb>
and finished off with a pair of expansive, green cloth shoes,<lb>
very like Chinese junks with the sails down. This figure,<lb>
gliding noiselessly about the dimly-lighted rooms, was<lb>
strongly suggestive of the spirit of a beer-barrel mounted<lb>
on cork-screws, haunting the old hotel in search of its lost<lb>
mates, emptied and staved in long ago.</p>
<p>Another goblin who frequently appeared to me, was the<lb>
attendant of &ldquo;the pathetic room,&rdquo; who, being a faithful soul,<lb>
was often up to tend two or three men, weak and wandering as<lb>
babies, after the fever had gone. The amiable creature beguiled<lb>
the watches of the night by brewing jorums of a fearful beverage,<lb>
which he called coffee, and insisted on sharing with<lb>
me; coming in with a great bowl of something like mud<lb>
soup, scalding hot, guiltless of cream, rich in an all-pervading<lb>
<pb n="043">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-056">

<figdesc>Page 043.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
flavor of molasses, scorch and tin pot. Such an amount of<lb>
good will and neighborly kindness also went into the mess,<lb>
that I never could find the heart to refuse, but always received<lb>
it with thanks, sipped it with hypocritical relish while he<lb>
remained, and whipped it into the slop-jar the instant he<lb>
departed, thereby gratifying him, securing one rousing laugh<lb>
in the doziest hour of the night, and no one was the worse for<lb>
the transaction but the pigs. Whether they were &ldquo;cut off<lb>
untimely in their sins,&rdquo; or not, I carefully abstained from<lb>
inquiring.</p>
<p>It was a strange life &mdash; asleep half the day, exploring<lb>
Washington the other half, and all night hovering, like a<lb>
massive cherubim, in a red rigolette, over the slumbering sons<lb>
of man. I liked it, and found many things to amuse, instruct,<lb>
and interest me. The snores alone were quite a study, varying<lb>
from the mild sniff to the stentorian snort, which startled the<lb>
echoes and hoisted the performer erect to accuse his neighbor<lb>
of the deed, magnanimously forgive him, and, wrapping the<lb>
drapery of his couch about him, lie down to vocal slumber.<lb>
After listening for a week to this band of wind instruments, I<lb>
indulged in the belief that I could recognize each by the snore<lb>
alone, and was tempted to join the chorus by breaking out<lb>
with John Brown's favorite hymn:</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;Blow ye the trumpet, blow!&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>I would have given much to have possessed the art of<lb>
sketching, for many of the faces became wonderfully interesting<lb>
when unconscious. Some grew stern and grim, the men<lb>
evidently dreaming of war, as they gave orders, groaned over<lb>
their wounds, or damned the rebels vigorously; some grew sad<lb>
and infinitely pathetic, as if the pain borne silently all day, revenged<lb>
itself by now betraying what the man's pride had concealed<lb>
so well. Often the roughest grew young and pleasant<lb>

</eaffig>
when sleep smoothed the hard lines away, letting the real nature<lb>
assert itself; many almost seemed to speak, and I learned to<lb>
know these men better by night than through any intercourse<lb>
by day. Sometimes they disappointed me, for faces that looked<lb>
merry and good in the light, grew bad and sly when the shadows<lb>
came; and though they made no confidences in words, I<lb>
read their lives, leaving them to wonder at the change of manner<lb>
this midnight magic wrought in their nurse. A few talked<lb>
busily; one drummer boy sang sweetly, though no persuasions<lb>
could win a note from him by day; and several depended on<lb>
being told what they had talked of in the morning. Even my<lb>
constitutionals in the chilly halls, possessed a certain charm,<lb>
for the house was never still. Sentinels tramped round it all<lb>
night long, their muskets glittering in the wintry moonlight as<lb>
they walked, or stood before the doors, straight and silent, as<lb>
figures of stone, causing one to conjure up romantic visions of<lb>
guarded forts, sudden surprises, and daring deeds; for in<lb>
these war times the hum drum life of Yankeedom has vanished,<lb>
and the most prosaic feel some thrill of that excitement which<lb>
stirs the nation's heart, and makes its capital a camp of hospitals.<lb>
Wandering up and down these lower halls, I often heard<lb>
cries from above, steps hurrying to and fro, saw surgeons<lb>
passing up, or men coming down carrying a stretcher, where<lb>
lay a long white figure, whose face was shrouded and whose<lb>
fight was done. Sometimes I stopped to watch the passers in<lb>
the street, the moonlight shining on the spire opposite, or the<lb>
gleam of some vessel floating, like a white-winged sea-gull,<lb>
down the broad Potomac, whose fullest flow can never wash<lb>
away the red stain of the land.</p>
<p>The night whose events I have a fancy to record, opened<lb>
with a little comedy, and closed with a great tragedy; for a<lb>
virtuous and useful life untimely ended is always tragical to<lb>

those who see not as God sees. My headquarters were beside<lb>
the bed of a New Jersey boy, crazed by the horrors of that<lb>
dreadful Saturday. A slight wound in the knee brought him<lb>
there; but his mind had suffered more than his body; some<lb>
string of that delicate machine was over strained, and, for<lb>
days, he had been re-living in imagination, the scenes he could<lb>
not forget, till his distress broke out in incoherent ravings,<lb>
pitiful to hear. As I sat by him, endeavoring to soothe his<lb>
poor distracted brain by the constant touch of wet hands over<lb>
his hot forehead, he lay cheering his comrades on, hurrying<lb>
them back, then counting them as they fell around him, often<lb>
clutching my arm, to drag me from the vicinity of a bursting<lb>
shell, or covering up his head to screen himself from a shower<lb>
of shot; his face brilliant with fever; his eyes restless; his<lb>
head never still; every muscle strained and rigid; while an<lb>
incessant stream of defiant shouts, whispered warnings, and<lb>
broken laments, poured from his lips with that forceful bewilderment<lb>
which makes such wanderings so hard to overhear.</p>
<p>It was past eleven, and my patient was slowly wearying<lb>
himself into fitful intervals of quietude, when, in one of these<lb>
pauses, a curious sound arrested my attention. Looking over<lb>
my shoulder, I saw a one-legged phantom hopping nimbly<lb>
down the room; and, going to meet it, recognized a certain<lb>
Pennsylvania gentleman, whose wound-fever had taken a turn<lb>
for the worse, and, depriving him of the few wits a drunken<lb>
campaign had left him, set him literally tripping on the light,<lb>
fantastic toe &ldquo;toward home,&rdquo; as he blandly informed me,<lb>
touching the military cap which formed a striking contrast to<lb>
the severe simplicity of the rest of his <hi rend="italics">undress</hi> uniform.<lb>
When sane, the least movement produced a roar of pain or<lb>
a volley of oaths; but the departure of reason seemed to<lb>
have wrought an agreeable change, both in the man and his<lb>
<pb n="046">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-059">

<figdesc>Page 046.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
manners; for, balancing himself on one leg, like a meditative<lb>
stork, he plunged into an animated discussion of the war, the<lb>
President, lager beer, and Enfield rifles, regardless of any<lb>
suggestions of mine as to the propriety of returning to bed,<lb>
lest he be court-martialed for desertion.</p>
<p>Any thing more supremely ridiculous can hardly be imagined<lb>
than this figure, all draped in white, its one foot<lb>
covered with a big blue sock, a dingy cap set rakingly askew<lb>
on its shaven head, and placid satisfaction beaming in its<lb>
broad red face, as it flourished a mug in one hand, an old<lb>
boot in the other, calling them canteen and knapsack, while it<lb>
skipped and fluttered in the most unearthly fashion. What to<lb>
do with the creature I didn't know; Dan was absent, and if I<lb>
went to find him, the perambulator might festoon himself out<lb>
of the window, set his toga on fire, or do some of his neighbors<lb>
a mischief. The attendant of the room was sleeping like a<lb>
near relative of the celebrated Seven, and nothing short of<lb>
pins would rouse him; for he had been out that day, and whiskey<lb>
asserted its supremacy in balmy whiffs. Still declaiming,<lb>
in a fine flow of eloquence, the demented gentleman hopped<lb>
on, blind and deaf to my graspings and entreaties; and I<lb>
was about to slam the door in his face, and run for help,<lb>
when a second and saner phantom came to the rescue,<lb>
in the likeness of a big Prussian, who spoke no English,<lb>
but divined the crisis, and put an end to it, by bundling the<lb>
lively monoped into his bed, like a baby, with an authoritative<lb>
command to &ldquo;stay put,&rdquo; which received added weight from<lb>
being delivered in an odd conglomeration of French and German,<lb>
accompanied by warning wags of a head decorated with<lb>
a yellow cotton night cap, rendered most imposing by a tassel<lb>
like a bell-pull. Rather exhausted by his excursion, the member<lb>
from Pennsylvania subsided; and, after an irrepressible<lb>
<pb n="047">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-060">

<figdesc>Page 047.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
laugh together, my Prussian ally and myself were returning<lb>
to our places, when the echo of a sob caused us to glance along<lb>
the beds. It came from one in the corner &mdash; such a little bed!&mdash;<lb>
and such a tearful little face looked up at us, as we stopped<lb>
beside it! The twelve years old drummer boy was not singing<lb>
now, but sobbing, with a manly effort all the while to stifle<lb>
the distressful sounds that would break out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Billy?&rdquo; I asked, as he rubbed the tears<lb>
away, and checked himself in the middle of a great sob to<lb>
answer plaintively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've got a chill, ma'am, but I aint cryin' for that, 'cause<lb>
I'm used to it. I dreamed Kit was here, and when I waked<lb>
up he wasn't, and I couldn't help it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy came in with the rest, and the man who was taken<lb>
dead from the ambulance was the Kit he mourned. Well he<lb>
might; for, when the wounded were brought from Fredericksburg,<lb>
the child lay in one of the camps thereabout, and<lb>
this good friend, though sorely hurt himself, would not leave<lb>
him to the exposure and neglect of such a time and place;<lb>
but, wrapping him in his own blanket, carried him in his arms<lb>
to the transport, tended him during the passage, and only<lb>
yielded up his charge when Death met him at the door of<lb>
the hospital which promised care and comfort for the boy.<lb>
For ten days, Billy had burned or shivered with fever and<lb>
ague, pining the while for Kit, and refusing to be comforted,<lb>
because he had not been able to thank him for the generous<lb>
protection, which, perhaps, had cost the giver's life. The<lb>
vivid dream had wrung the childish heart with a fresh pang,<lb>
and when I tried the solace fitted for his years, the remorseful<lb>
fear that haunted him found vent in a fresh burst of tears, as<lb>
he looked at the wasted hands I was endeavoring to warm:</p>
<p>` Oh! if I'd only been as thin when Kit carried me as I am<lb>
<pb n="048">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-061">

<figdesc>Page 048.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
now, maybe he wouldn't have died; but I was heavy, he was<lb>
hurt worser than we knew, and so it killed him; and I didn't<lb>
see him, to say good bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thought had troubled him in secret; and my assurances<lb>
that his friend would probably have died at all events,<lb>
hardly assuaged the bitterness of his regretful grief.</p>
<p>At this juncture, the delirious man began to shout; the onelegged<lb>
rose up in his bed, as if preparing for another dart,<lb>
Billy bewailed himself more piteously than before: and if<lb>
ever a woman was at her wit's end, that distracted female was<lb>
Nurse Periwinkle, during the space of two or three minutes,<lb>
as she vibrated between the three beds, like an agitated pendulum.<lb>
Like a most opportune reinforcement, Dan, the bandy,<lb>
appeared, and devoted himself to the lively party, leaving me<lb>
free to return to my post; for the Prussian, with a nod and a<lb>
smile, took the lad away to his own bed, and lulled him to<lb>
sleep with a soothing murmur, like a mammoth humble bee.<lb>
I liked that in Fritz, and if he ever wondered afterward at the<lb>
dainties which sometimes found their way into his rations, or<lb>
the extra comforts of his bed, he might have found a solution<lb>
of the mystery in sundry persons' knowledge of the fatherly<lb>
action of that night.</p>
<p>Hardly was I settled again, when the inevitable bowl<lb>
appeared, and its bearer delivered a message I had expected,<lb>
yet dreaded to receive:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John is going, ma'am, and wants to see you, if you can<lb>
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment this boy is asleep; tell him so, and let me<lb>
know if I am in danger of being too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My, Ganymede departed, and while I quieted poor Shaw, I<lb>
thought of John. He came in a day or two after the others;<lb>
and, one evening, when I entered my &ldquo;pathetic room,&rdquo; I<lb>
<pb n="049">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-062">

<figdesc>Page 049.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
found a lately emptied bed occupied by a large, fair man,<lb>
with a fine face, and the serenest eyes I ever met. One of<lb>
the earlier comers had often spoken of a friend, who had<lb>
remained behind, that those apparently worse wounded than<lb>
himself might reach a shelter first. It seemed a David and<lb>
Jonathan sort of friendship. The man fretted for his mate,<lb>
and was never tired of praising John&mdash;his courage, sobriety,<lb>
self-denial, and unfailing kindliness of heart; always winding<lb>
up with: &ldquo;He's an out an' out fine feller, ma'am; you see<lb>
if he aint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence, and<lb>
when he came, watched him for a night or two, before I made<lb>
friends with him; for, to tell the truth, I was a little afraid of<lb>
the stately looking man, whose bed had to be lengthened to<lb>
accommodate his commanding stature; who seldom spoke,<lb>
uttered no complaint, asked no sympathy, but tranquilly<lb>
observed what went on about him; and, as he lay high upon<lb>
his pillows, no picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever<lb>
fuller of real dignity than this Virginia blacksmith. A most<lb>
attractive face he had, framed in brown hair and beard, comely<lb>
featured and full of vigor, as yet unsubdued by pain; thoughtful<lb>
and often beautifully mild while watching the afflictions of<lb>
others, as if entirely forgetful of his own. His mouth was<lb>
grave and firm, with plenty of will and courage in its lines,<lb>
but a smile could make it as sweet as any woman's; and his<lb>
eyes were child's eyes, looking one fairly in the face, with a<lb>
clear, straightforward glance, which promised well for such as<lb>
placed their faith in him. He seemed to cling to life, as if it<lb>
were rich in duties and delights, and he had learned the secret<lb>
of content. The only time I saw his composure disturbed,<lb>
was when my surgeon brought another to examine John, who<lb>
scrutinized their faces with an anxious look, asking of the<lb>
<pb n="050">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-063">

<figdesc>Page 050.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
elder: &ldquo;Do you think I shall pull through, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope<lb>
so, my man.&rdquo; And, as the two passed on John's eye still<lb>
followed them, with an intentness which would have won a<lb>
truer answer from them, had they seen it. A momentary<lb>
shadow flitted over his face; then came the usual serenity, as<lb>
if, in that brief eclipse, he had acknowledged the existence of<lb>
some hard possibility, and, asking nothing yet hoping all<lb>
things, left the issue in God's hands, with that submission<lb>
which is true piety.</p>
<p>The next night, as I went my rounds with Dr. P., I<lb>
happened to ask which man in the room probably suffered<lb>
most; and, to my great surprise, he glanced at John:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every breath he draws is like a stab; for the ball pierced<lb>
the left lung, broke a rib, and did no end of damage here and<lb>
there; so the poor lad can find neither forgetfulness nor ease,<lb>
because he must lie on his wounded back or suffocate. It<lb>
will be a hard struggle, and a long one, for he possesses great<lb>
vitality; but even his temperate life can't save him; I wish it<lb>
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't mean he must die, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, there's not the slightest hope for him; and<lb>
you'd better tell him so before long; women have a way of<lb>
doing such things comfortably, so I leave it to you. He<lb>
won't last more than a day or two, at furthest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily, if I<lb>
had not learned the wisdom of bottling up one's tears for<lb>
leisure moments. Such an end seemed very hard for such a<lb>
man, when half a dozen worn out, worthless bodies round him,<lb>
were gathering up the remnants of wasted lives, to linger on<lb>
for years perhaps, burdens to others, daily reproaches to<lb>
themselves. The army needed men like John, earnest, brave,<lb>
and faithful; fighting for liberty and justice with both heart<lb>
<pb n="051">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-064">

<figdesc>Page 051.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and hand, true soldiers of the Lord. I could not give him<lb>
up so soon, or think with any patience of so excellent a nature<lb>
robbed of its fulfiment, and blundered into eternity by the<lb>
rashness or stupidity of those at whose hands so many lives<lb>
may be required. It was an easy thing for Dr. P. to say:<lb>
&ldquo;Tell him he must die,&rdquo; but a cruelly hard thing to do, and<lb>
by no means as &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; as he politely suggested. I<lb>
had not the heart to do it then, and privately indulged the<lb>
hope that some change for the better might take place, in spite<lb>
of gloomy prophesies; so, rendering my task unnecessary.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, as I came in again, with fresh rollers,<lb>
I saw John sitting erect, with no one to support him, while<lb>
the surgeon dressed his back. I had never hitherto seen it<lb>
done; for, having simpler wounds to attend to, and knowing<lb>
the fidelity of the attendant, I had left John to him, thinking<lb>
it might be more agreeable and safe; for both strength and<lb>
experience were needed in his case. I had forgotten that the<lb>
strong man might long for the gentle tendance of a woman's<lb>
hands, the sympathetic magnetism of a woman's presence, as<lb>
well as the feebler souls about him. The Doctor's words<lb>
caused me to reproach myself with neglect, not of any real<lb>
duty perhaps, but of those little cares and kindnesses that<lb>
solace homesick spirits, and make the heavy hours pass easier.<lb>
John looked lonely and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent<lb>
head, hands folded on his knee, and no outward sign of suffering,<lb>
till, looking nearer, I saw great tears roll down and drop<lb>
upon the floor. It was a new sight there; for, though I had<lb>
seen many suffer, some swore, some groaned, most endured<lb>
silently, but none wept. Yet it did not seem weak, only very<lb>
touching, and straightway my fear vanished, my heart opened<lb>
wide and took him in, as, gathering the bent head in my arms,<lb>
<pb n="052">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-065">

<figdesc>Page 052.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
as freely as if he had been a little child, I said, &ldquo;Let me<lb>
help you bear it, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never, on any human countenance, have I seen so swift<lb>
and beautiful a look of gratitude, surprise and comfort, as that<lb>
which answered me more eloquently than the whispered &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma'am, this is right good! this is what I<lb>
wanted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not ask for it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't like to be a trouble; you seemed so busy, and I<lb>
could manage to get on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not want it any more, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did he; for now I understood the wistful look that<lb>
sometimes followed me, as I went out, after a brief pause<lb>
beside his bed, or merely a passing nod, while busied with<lb>
those who seemed to need me more than he, because more<lb>
urgent in their demands. Now I knew that to him, as to so<lb>
many, I was the poor substitute for mother, wife, or sister,<lb>
and in his eyes no stranger, but a friend who hitherto had<lb>
seemed neglectful; for, in his modesty, he had never guessed<lb>
the truth. This was changed now; and, through the tedious<lb>
operation of probing, bathing, and dressing his wounds, he<lb>
leaned against me, holding my hand fast, and, if pain wrung<lb>
further tears from him, no one saw them fall but me. When<lb>
he was laid down again, I hovered about him, in a remorseful<lb>
state of mind that would not let me rest, till I had bathed his<lb>
face, brushed his bonny brown hair, set all things smooth<lb>
about him, and laid a knot of heath and heliotrope on his<lb>
clean pillow. While doing this, he watched me with the satisfied<lb>
expression I so liked to see; and when I offered the<lb>
little nosegay, held it carefully in his great hand, smoothed a<lb>
ruffled leaf or two, surveyed and smelt it with an air of<lb>
genuine delight, and lay contentedly regarding the glimmer of<lb>
<pb n="053">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-066">

<figdesc>Page 053.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the sunshine on the green. Although the manliest man among<lb>
my forty, he said, &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; like a little boy; received<lb>
suggestions for his comfort with the quick smile that brightened<lb>
his whole face; and now and then, as I stood tidying the<lb>
table by his bed, I felt him softly touch my gown, as if to<lb>
assure himself that I was there. Anything more natural and<lb>
frank I never saw, and found this brave John as bashful as<lb>
brave, yet full of excellencies and fine aspirations, which,<lb>
having no power to express themselves in words, seemed to<lb>
have bloomed into his character and made him what he was.</p>
<p>After that night, an hour of each evening that remained to<lb>
him was devoted to his ease or pleasure. He could not talk<lb>
much, for breath was precious, and he spoke in whispers; but<lb>
from occasional conversations, I gleaned scraps of private<lb>
history which only added to the affection and respect I felt for<lb>
him. Once he asked me to write a letter, and as I settled pen<lb>
and paper, I said, with an irrepressible glimmer of feminine<lb>
curiosity, &ldquo;Shall it be addressed to wife, or mother, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, ma'am; I've got no wife, and will write to<lb>
mother myself when I get better. Did you think I was<lb>
married because of this?&rdquo; he asked, touching a plain ring he<lb>
wore, and often turned thoughtfully on his finger when he lay<lb>
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly that, but more from a settled sort of look you<lb>
have; a look which young men seldom get until they marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't know that; but I'm not so very young, ma'am,<lb>
thirty in May, and have been what you might call settled this<lb>
ten years. Mother's a widow, I'm the oldest child she has,<lb>
and it wouldn't do for me to marry until Lizzy has a home of<lb>
her own, and Jack's learned his trade; for we're not rich,<lb>
and I must be father to the children and husband to the dear<lb>
old woman, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="054">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-067">

<figdesc>Page 054.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt but you are both, John; yet how came you to<lb>
go to war, if you felt so? Wasn't enlisting as bad as marrying?&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am, not as I see it, for one is helping my neighbor,<lb>
the other pleasing myself. I went because I couldn't help it.<lb>
I didn't want the glory or the pay; I wanted the right thing<lb>
done, and people kept saying the men who were in earnest<lb>
ought to fight. I was in earnest, the Lord knows! but I held<lb>
off as long as I could, not knowing which was my duty.<lb>
Mother saw the case, gave me her ring to keep me steady, and<lb>
said `Go:' so I went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short story and a simple one, but the man and the mother<lb>
were portrayed better than pages of fine writing could have<lb>
done it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever regret that you came, when you lie here<lb>
suffering so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, ma'am; I haven't helped a great deal, but I've<lb>
shown I was willing to give my life, and perhaps I've got to;<lb>
but I don't blame anybody, and if it was to do over again, I'd<lb>
do it. I'm a little sorry I wasn't wounded in front; it looks<lb>
cowardly to be hit in the back, but I obeyed orders, and it<lb>
don't matter in the end, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor John! it did not matter now, except that a shot in<lb>
front might have spared the long agony in store for him. He<lb>
seemed to read the thought that troubled me, as he spoke so<lb>
hopefully when there was no hope, for he suddenly added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my first battle; do they think it's going to be my<lb>
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid they do, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the hardest question I had ever been called upon to<lb>
answer; doubly hard with those clear eyes fixed on mine,<lb>
foreing a truthful answer by their own truth. He seemed a<lb>
<pb n="055">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-068">

<figdesc>Page 055.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
little startled at first, pondered over the fateful fact a moment,<lb>
then shook his head, with a glance at the broad chest and<lb>
muscular limbs stretched out before him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm not afraid, but it's difficult to believe all at once. I'm<lb>
so strong it don't seem possible for such a little wound to kill<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merry Mercutio's dying words glanced through my memory<lb>
as he spoke: &ldquo;'Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a<lb>
church door, but 'tis enough.&rdquo; And John would have said<lb>
the same could he have seen the ominous black holes between<lb>
his shoulders; he never had, but, seeing the ghastly sights<lb>
about him, could not believe his own wound more fatal than<lb>
these, for all the suffering it caused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I write to your mother, now?&rdquo; I asked, thinking<lb>
that these sudden tidings might change all plans and puposes.<lb>
But they did not; for the man received the order of the Divine<lb>
Commander to march with the same unquestioning obedience<lb>
with which the soldier had received that of the human one;<lb>
doubtless remembering that the first led him to life, and the<lb>
last to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am; to Jack just the same; he'll break it to<lb>
her best, and I'll add a line to her myself when you get<lb>
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I wrote the letter which he dictated, finding it better<lb>
than any I had sent; for, though here and there a little ungrammatical<lb>
or inelegant, each sentence came to me briefly worded,<lb>
but most expressive; full of excellent counsel to the boy,<lb>
tenderly bequeathing &ldquo;mother and Lizzie&rdquo; to his care, and<lb>
bidding him good bye in words the sadder for their simplicity.<lb>
He added a few lines, with steady hand, and, as I sealed it,<lb>
said, with a patient sort of sigh, &ldquo;I hope the answer will<lb>
come in time for me to see it;&rdquo; then, turning away his face,<lb>
<pb n="056">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-069">

<figdesc>Page 056.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
laid the flowers against his lips, as if to hide some quiver of<lb>
emotion at the thought of such a sudden sundering of all the<lb>
dear home ties.</p>
<p>These things had happened two days before; now John<lb>
was dying, and the letter had not come. I had been summoned<lb>
to many death beds in my life, but to none that made<lb>
my heart ache as it did then, since my mother called me to<lb>
watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its gentleness<lb>
and patient strength. As I went in, John stretched out both<lb>
hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you'd come! I guess I'm moving on, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was; and so rapidly that, even while he spoke, over his<lb>
face I saw the grey veil falling that no human hand can lift.<lb>
I sat down by him, wiped the drops from his forehead, stirred<lb>
the air about him with the slow wave of a fan, and waited to<lb>
help him die. He stood in sore need of help&mdash;and I could<lb>
do so little; for, as the doctor had foretold, the strong body<lb>
rebelled against death, and fought every inch of the way,<lb>
forcing him to draw each breath with a spasm, and clench his<lb>
hands with an imploring look, as if he asked, &ldquo;How long<lb>
must I endure this, and be still!&rdquo; For hours he suffered<lb>
dumbly, without a moment's respite, or a moment's murmuring;<lb>
his limbs grew cold, his face damp, his lips white, and, again<lb>
and again, he tore the covering off his breast, as if the lightest<lb>
weight added to his agony; yet through it all, his eyes never<lb>
lost their perfect serenity, and the man's soul seemed to sit<lb>
therein, undaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh.</p>
<p>One by one, the men woke, and round the room appeared<lb>
a circle of pale faces and watchful eyes, full of awe and pity;<lb>
for, though a stranger, John was beloved by all. Each man<lb>
there had wondered at his patience, respected his piety, admired<lb>
his fortitude, and now lamented his hard death; for the<lb>
<pb n="057">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-070">

<figdesc>Page 057.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
influence of an upright nature had made itself deeply felt,<lb>
even in one little week. Presently, the Jonathan who so<lb>
loved this comely David, came creeping from his bed for a<lb>
last look and word. The kind soul was full of trouble, as the<lb>
choke in his voice, the grasp of his hand, betrayed; but there<lb>
were no tears, and the farewell of the friends was the more<lb>
touching for its brevity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old boy, how are you?&rdquo; faltered the one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most through, thank heaven!&rdquo; whispered the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I say or do anything for you anywheres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my things home, and tell them that I did my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will! I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, John, good bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed each other, tenderly as women, and so parted,<lb>
for poor Ned could not stay to see his comrade die. For a<lb>
little while, there was no sound in the room but the drip of<lb>
water, from a stump or two, and John's distressful gasps, as<lb>
he slowly breathed his life away. I thought him nearly gone,<lb>
and had just laid down the fan, believing its help to be no<lb>
longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his bed, and cried<lb>
out with a bitter cry that broke the silence, sharply startling<lb>
every one with its agonized appeal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God's sake, give me air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the only cry pain or death had wrung from him, the<lb>
only boon he had asked; and none of us could grant it, for<lb>
all the airs that blew were useless now. Dan flung up the<lb>
window. The first red streak of dawn was warming the grey<lb>
east, a herald of the coming sun; John saw it, and with the<lb>
love of light which lingers in us to the end, seemed to read in<lb>
it a sign of hope of help, for, over his whole face there broke<lb>
that mysterious expression, brighter than any smile, which<lb>

often comes to eyes that look their last. He laid himself<lb>
gently down; and, stretching out his strong right arm, as if to<lb>
grasp and bring the blessed air to his lips in a fuller flow,<lb>
lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness, which assured us that<lb>
for him suffering was forever past. He died then; for, though<lb>
the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little longer,<lb>
they were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt<lb>
against the wreek, which an immortal voyager had deserted<lb>
with a smile. He never spoke again, but to the end held my<lb>
hand close, so close that when he was asleep at last, I could<lb>
not draw it away. Dan helped me, warning me as he did so<lb>
that it was unsafe for dead and living flesh to lie so long<lb>
together; but though my hand was strangely cold and stiff,<lb>
and four white marks remained across its back, even when<lb>
warmth and color had returned elsewhere, I could not but be<lb>
glad that, through its touch, the presence of human sympathy,<lb>
perhaps, had lightened that hard hour.</p>
<p>When they had made him ready for the grave, John lay in<lb>
state for half an hour, a thing which seldom happened in that<lb>
busy place; but a universal sentiment of reverence and<lb>
affection seemed to fill the hearts of all who had known or<lb>
hoard of him; and when the rumor of his death went through<lb>
the house, always astir, many came to see him, and I felt a<lb>
tender sort of pride in my lost patient; for he looked a most<lb>
heroic figure, lying there stately and still as the statue of some<lb>
young knight asleep upon his tomb. The lovely expression<lb>
which so often beautifies dead faces, soon replaced the marks<lb>
of pain, and I longed for those who loved him best to see him<lb>
when half an hour's acquaintance with Death had made them<lb>
friends. As we stood looking at him, the ward master handed<lb>
me a letter, saying it had been forgotten the night before. It<lb>
was John's letter, come just an hour too late to gladden the<lb>

eyes that had longed and looked for it so eagerly! but he had<lb>
it; for, after I had cut some brown locks for his mother, and<lb>
taken off the ring to send her, telling how well the talisman<lb>
had done its work, I kissed this good son for her sake, and<lb>
laid the letter in his hand, still folded as when I drew my<lb>
own away, feeling that its place was there, and making myself<lb>
happy with the thought, that, even in his solitary grave in the<lb>
&ldquo;Government Lot,&rdquo; he would not be without some token of<lb>
the love which makes life beautiful and outlives death. Then<lb>
I left him, glad to have known so genuine a man, and carrying<lb>
with me an enduring memory of the brave Virginia blacksmith,<lb>
as he lay serenely waiting for the dawn of that long day<lb>
which knows no night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, we shall have you sick in your bed, unless<lb>
you keep yourself warm and quiet for a few days. Widow<lb>
Wadman can take care of the ward alone, now the men are so<lb>
comfortable, and have her vacation when you are about again.<lb>
Now do be prudent in time, and don't let me have to add a<lb>
Periwinkle to my bouquet of patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This advice was delivered, in a paternal manner, by the<lb>
youngest surgeon in the hospital, a kind-hearted little gentleman,<lb>
who seemed to consider me a frail young blossom, that<lb>
needed much cherishing, instead of a stout spinster, who<lb>
had been knocking about the world for thirty years. At the<lb>
time I write of, he discovered me sitting on the stairs, with a<lb>
fine cloud of unwholesome steam rising from the washroom;<lb>
a party of January breezes disporting themselves in the halls;<lb>
and perfumes, by no means from &ldquo;Araby the blest,&rdquo; keeping<lb>
them company; while I enjoyed a fit of coughing, which<lb>
caused my head to spin in a way that made the application of<lb>
a cool banister both necessary and agreeable, as I waited for<lb>
<pb n="061">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-074">

<figdesc>Page 061.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the frolicsome wind to restore the breath I'd lost; cheering<lb>
myself, meantime, with a secret conviction that pneumonia<lb>
was waiting for me round the corner. This piece of advice<lb>
had been offered by several persons for a week, and refused<lb>
by me with the obstinacy with which my sex is so richly gifted.<lb>
But the last few hours had developed several surprising internal<lb>
and external phenomena, which impressed upon me the fact<lb>
that if I didn't make a masterly retreat very soon, I should<lb>
tumble down somewhere, and have to be borne ignominiously<lb>
from the field. My head felt like a cannon ball; my feet had<lb>
a tendency to cleave to the floor; the walls at times undulated<lb>
in a most disagreeable manner; people looked unnaturally<lb>
big; and the very bottles on the mantle piece appeared to<lb>
dance derisively before my eyes. Taking these things into<lb>
consideration, while blinking stupidly at Dr. Z., I resolved to<lb>
retire gracefully, if I must; so, with a valedictory to my boys,<lb>
a private lecture to Mrs. Wadman, and a fervent wish that I<lb>
could take off my body and work in my soul, I mournfully<lb>
ascended to my apartment, and Nurse P. was reported off<lb>
duty.</p>
<p>For the benefit of any ardent damsel whose patriotic fancy<lb>
may have surrounded hospital life with a halo of charms, I<lb>
will briefly describe the bower to which I retired, in a somewhat<lb>
ruinous condition. It was well ventilated, for five panes of<lb>
glass had suffered compound fractures, which all the surgeons<lb>
and nurses had failed to heal; the two windows were draped<lb>
with sheets, the church hospital opposite being a brick and<lb>
mortar Argus, and the female mind cherishing a prejudice in<lb>
favor of retiracy during the night-capped periods of existence.<lb>
A bare floor supported two narrow iron beds, spread with thin<lb>
mattrasses like plasters, furnished with pillows in the last<lb>
stages of consumption. In a fire place, guiltless of shovel,<lb>
<pb n="062">

</eaffig>
tongs, andirons, or grate, burned a log, inch by inch, being too<lb>
long to go on all at once; so, while the fire blazed away at one<lb>
end, I did the same at the other, as I tripped over it a dozen<lb>
times a day, and flew up to poke it a dozen times at night. A<lb>
mirror (let us be elegant!) of the dimensions of a muffin,<lb>
and about as reflective, hung over a tin basin, blue pitcher,<lb>
and a brace of yellow mugs. Two invalid tables, ditto chairs,<lb>
wandered here and there, and the closet contained a varied<lb>
collection of bonnets, bottles, bags, boots, bread and butter,<lb>
boxes and bugs. The closet was a regular Blue Beard<lb>
cupboard to me; I always opened it with fear and trembling,<lb>
owing to rats, and shut it in anguish of spirit; for time and<lb>
space were not to be had, and chaos reigned along with the<lb>
rats. Our chimney-piece was decorated with a flat-iron, a<lb>
Bible, a candle minus stick, a lavender bottle, a new tin pan,<lb>
so brilliant that it served nicely for a pier-glass, and such of<lb>
the portly black bugs as preferred a warmer climate than the<lb>
rubbish hole afforded. Two arks, commonly called trunks,<lb>
lurked behind the door, containing the worldly goods of the<lb>
twain who laughed and cried, slept and scrambled, in this<lb>
refuge; while from the white-washed walls above either bed,<lb>
looked down the pictured faces of those whose memory could<lb>
make for us &mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;One little room an everywhere.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>For a day or two I managed to appear at meals; for the<lb>
human grub must eat till the butterfly is ready to break loose,<lb>
and no one had time to come up two flights while it was<lb>
possible for me to come down. Far be it from me to add<lb>
another affliction or reproach to that enduring man, the steward;<lb>
for, compared with his predecessor, he was a horn of<lb>
plenty; but &mdash; I put it to any candid mind &mdash; is not the<lb>
<pb n="063">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-076">

<figdesc>Page 063.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
following bill of fare susceptible of improvement, without<lb>
plunging the nation madly into debt? The three meals were<lb>
&ldquo;pretty much of a muchness,&rdquo; and consisted of beef, evidently<lb>
put down for the men of '76; pork, just in from the street;<lb>
army bread, composed of saw-dust and saleratus; butter, salt<lb>
as if churned by Lot's wife; stewed blackberries, so much<lb>
like preserved cockroaches, that only those devoid of imagination<lb>
could partake thereof with relish; coffee, mild and<lb>
muddy; tea, three dried huckleberry leaves to a quart of<lb>
water &mdash; flavored with lime &mdash; also animated and unconscious of<lb>
any approach to clearness. Variety being the spice of life, a<lb>
small pinch of the article would have been appreciated by the<lb>
hungry, hard-working sisterhood, one of whom, though accustomed<lb>
to plain fare, soon found herself reduced to bread and<lb>
water; having an inborn repugnance to the fat of the land,<lb>
and the salt of the earth.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of these hospital meals was the rapidity<lb>
with which the edibles vanished, and the impossibility of getting<lb>
a drop or crumb after the usual time. At the first ring of the<lb>
bell, a general stampede took place; some twenty hungry<lb>
souls rushed to the dining-room, swept over the table like a<lb>
swarm of locusts, and left no fragment for any tardy creature<lb>
who arrived fifteen minutes late. Thinking it of more importance<lb>
that the patients should be well and comfortably fed, I<lb>
took my time about my own meals for the first day or two<lb>
after I came, but was speedily enlightened by Isaac, the black<lb>
waiter, who bore with me a few times, and then informed me,<lb>
looking as stern as fate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, mam, ef you comes so late you can't have no<lb>
vittles, &mdash; 'cause I'm 'bleeged fer ter git things ready fer de<lb>
doctors 'mazin' spry arter you nusses and folks is done. De<lb>
gen'lemen don't kere fer ter wait, no more does I; so you<lb>
<pb n="064">

<figdesc>Page 064.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
jes' please ter come at de time, and dere won't be no frettin'<lb>
nowheres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a new sensation to stand looking at a full table,<lb>
painfully conscious of one of the vacuums which Nature<lb>
abhors, and receive orders to right about face, without<lb>
partaking of the nourishment which your inner woman clamorously<lb>
demanded. The doctors always fared better than we;<lb>
and for a moment a desperate impulse prompted me to give<lb>
them a hint, by walking off with the mutton, or confiscating<lb>
the pie. But Ike's eye was on me, and, to my shame be it<lb>
spoken, I walked meekly away; went dinnerless that day,<lb>
and that evening went to market, laying in a small stock of<lb>
crackers, cheese and apples, that my boys might not be<lb>
neglected, nor myself obliged to bolt solid and liquid dyspepsias,<lb>
or starve. This plan would have succeeded admirably<lb>
had not the evil star under which I was born, been in the<lb>
ascendant during that month, and cast its malign influences<lb>
even into my &ldquo;'umble&rdquo; larder; for the rats had their dessert<lb>
off my cheese, the bugs set up housekeeping in my crackerbag,<lb>
and the apples like all worldly riches, took to themselves<lb>
wings and flew away; whither no man could tell, though<lb>
certain black imps might have thrown light upon the matter,<lb>
had not the plaintiff in the case been loth to add another to<lb>
the many trials of long-suffering Africa. After this failure I<lb>
resigned myself to fate, and, remembering that bread was called<lb>
the staff of life, leaned pretty exclusively upon it; but it<lb>
proved a broken reed, and I came to the ground after a few<lb>
weeks of prison fare, varied by an occasional potato or surreptitious<lb>
sip of milk.</p>
<p>Very soon after leaving the care of my ward, I discovered<lb>
that I had no appetite, and cut the bread and butter interests<lb>
almost entirely, trying the exercise and sun cure instead.<lb>
<pb n="065">

</eaffig>
Flattering myself that I had plenty of time, and could see all<lb>
that was to be seen, so far as a lone lorn female could venture<lb>
in a city, one-half of whose male population seemed to be<lb>
taking the other half to the guard-house, &mdash; every morning I<lb>
took a brisk run in one direction or another; for the January<lb>
days were as mild as Spring. A rollicking north wind and<lb>
occasional snow storm would have been more to my taste, for<lb>
the one would have braced and refreshed tired body and soul,<lb>
the other have purified the air, and spread a clean coverlid<lb>
over the bed, wherein the capital of these United States<lb>
appeared to be dozing pretty soundly just then.</p>
<p>One of these trips was to the Armory Hospital, the neatness,<lb>
comfort, and convenience of which makes it an honor to its<lb>
presiding genius, and arouses all the covetous propensities of<lb>
such nurses as came from other hospitals to visit it.</p>
<p>The long, clean, warm, and airy wards, built barrack-fashion,<lb>
with the nurse's room at the end, were fully appreciated by<lb>
Nurse Periwinkle, whose ward and private bower were cold,<lb>
dirty, inconvenient, up stairs and down stairs, and in everybody's<lb>
chamber. At the Armory, in ward K, I found a<lb>
cheery, bright-eyed, white-aproned little lady, reading at her<lb>
post near the stove; matting under her feet; a draft of fresh<lb>
air flowing in above her head; a table full of trays, glasses,<lb>
and such matters, on one side, a large, well-stocked medicine<lb>
chest on the other; and all her duty seemed to be going about<lb>
now and then to give doses, issue orders, which well-trained<lb>
attendants executed, and pet, advise, or comfort Tom, Dick,<lb>
or Harry, as she found best. As I watched the proceedings,<lb>
I recalled my own tribulations, and contrasted the two hospitals<lb>
in a way that would have caused my summary dismissal, could<lb>
it have been reported at headquarters. Here, order, method,<lb>
common sense and liberality seemed to rule in a style<lb>
<pb n="066">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-079">

<figdesc>Page 066.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
that did one's heart good to see; at the Hurly burly Hotel,<lb>
disorder, discomfort, bad management, and no visible head,<lb>
reduced things to a condition which I despair of describing.<lb>
The circumlocution fashion prevailed, forms and fusses tormented<lb>
our souls, and unnecessary strictness in one place was<lb>
counterbalanced by unpardonable laxity in another. Here is<lb>
a sample: I am dressing Sam Dammer's shoulder; and, having<lb>
cleansed the wound, look about for some strips of adhesive<lb>
plaster to hold on the little square of wet linen which is to<lb>
cover the gunshot wound; the case is not in the tray; Frank,<lb>
the sleepy, half-sick attendant, knows nothing of it; we<lb>
rummage high and low; Sam is tired, and fumes; Frank<lb>
dawdles and yawns; the men advise and laugh at the flurry;<lb>
I feel like a boiling tea-kettle, with the lid ready to fly off and<lb>
damage somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and borrow some from the next ward, and spend the<lb>
rest of the day in finding ours,&rdquo; I finally command. A pause;<lb>
then Frank scuffles back with the message: &ldquo;Miss Peppercorn<lb>
ain't got none, and says you ain't no business to lose your own<lb>
duds and go borrowin' other folkses.&rdquo; I say nothing, for fear<lb>
of saying too much, but fly to the surgery. Mr. Toddypestle<lb>
informs me that I can't have anything without an order from<lb>
the surgeon of my ward. Great heavens! where is he? and<lb>
away I rush, up and down, here and there, till at last I find<lb>
him, in a state of bliss over a complicated amputation, in the<lb>
fourth story. I make my demand; he answers: &ldquo;In five<lb>
minutes,&rdquo; and works away, with his head upside down, as he<lb>
ties an artery, saws a bone, or does a little needle-work, with<lb>
a visible relish and very sanguinary pair of hands. The five<lb>
minutes grow to fifteen, and Frank appears, with the remark<lb>
that, &ldquo;Dammer wants to know what in thunder you are<lb>
keeping him there with his finger on a wet rag for?&rdquo; Dr. P.<lb>
<pb n="067">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-080">

<figdesc>Page 067.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
tears himself away long enough to scribble the order, with<lb>
which I plunge downward to the surgery again, find the door<lb>
locked, and, while hammering away on it, am told that two<lb>
friends are waiting to see me in the hall. The matron being<lb>
away, her parlor is locked, and there is no where to see my<lb>
guests but in my own room, and no time to enjoy them till<lb>
the plaster is found. I settle this matter, and circulate through<lb>
the house to find Toddypestle, who has no right to leave the<lb>
surgery till night. He is discovered in the dead house, smoking<lb>
a cigar, and very much the worse for his researches among the<lb>
spirituous preparations that fill the surgery shelves. He is<lb>
inclined to be gallant, and puts the finishing blow to the fire<lb>
of my wrath; for the tea-kettle lid flies off, and driving him<lb>
before me to his post, I fling down the order, take what I<lb>
choose; and, leaving the absurd incapable kissing his hand to<lb>
me, depart, feeling as Grandma Riglesty is reported to have<lb>
done, when she vainly sought for chips, in Bimleck Jackwood's<lb>
&ldquo;shifless paster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find Dammer a well acted charade of his own name, and,<lb>
just as I get him done, struggling the while with a burning<lb>
desire to clap an adhesive strip across his mouth, full of<lb>
heaven-defying oaths, Frank takes up his boot to put it on,<lb>
and exclaims:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm blest ef here ain't that case now! I recollect seeing<lb>
it fall in this mornin', but forgot all about it, till my heel<lb>
went smash inter it. Here, ma'am, ketch hold on it, and give<lb>
the boys a sheet on 't all round, 'gainst it tumbles inter t'other<lb>
boot next time yer want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a look could annihilate, Francis Saucebox would have<lb>
ceased to exist; but it couldn't; therefore, he yet lives, to<lb>
aggravate some unhappy woman's soul, and wax fat in some<lb>
equally congenial situation.</p>

<p>Now, while I'm freeing my mind, I should like to enter my<lb>
protest against employing convalescents as attendants, instead<lb>
of strong, properly trained, and cheerful men. How it may<lb>
be in other places I cannot say; but here it was a source of<lb>
constant trouble and confusion, these feeble, ignorant men<lb>
trying to sweep, scrub, lift, and wait upon their sicker comrades.<lb>
One, with a diseased heart, was expected to run up and down<lb>
stairs, carry heavy trays, and move helpless men; he tried it,<lb>
and grew rapidly worse than when he first came: and, when<lb>
he was ordered out to march away to the convalescent hospital,<lb>
fell, in a sort of fit, before he turned the corner, and was<lb>
brought back to die. Another, hurt by a fall from his horse,<lb>
endeavored to do his duty, but failed entirely, and the wrath<lb>
of the ward master fell upon the nurse, who must either scrub<lb>
the rooms herself, or take the lecture; for the boy looked stout<lb>
and well, and the master never happened to see him turn<lb>
white with pain, or hear him groan in his sleep when an involuntary<lb>
motion strained his poor back. Constant complaints<lb>
were being made of incompetent attendants, and some dozen<lb>
women did double duty, and then were blamed for breaking<lb>
down. If any hospital director fancies this a good and<lb>
economical arrangement, allow one used up nurse to tell him<lb>
it isn't, and beg him to spare the sisterhood, who sometimes,<lb>
in their sympathy, forget that they are mortal, and run the<lb>
risk of being made immortal, sooner than is agreeable to their<lb>
partial friends.</p>
<p>Another of my few rambles took me to the Senate Chamber,<lb>
hoping to hear and see if this large machine was run any<lb>
better than some small ones I knew of. I was too late, and<lb>
found the Speaker's chair occupied by a colored gentleman of<lb>
ten; while two others were on their legs, having a hot<lb>
debate on the cornball question, as they gathered the waste<lb>
<pb n="069">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-082">

<figdesc>Page 069.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="F">
paper strewn about the floor into bags; and several white<lb>
members played leap-frog over the desks, a much wholesomer<lb>
relaxation than some of the older Senators indulge in, I fancy.<lb>
Finding the coast clear, I likewise gambolled up and down,<lb>
from gallery to gallery; sat in Sumner's chair, and cudgelled<lb>
an imaginary Brooks within an inch of his life; examined<lb>
Wilson's books in the coolest possible manner; warmed my<lb>
feet at one of the national registers; read people's names on<lb>
scattered envelopes, and pocketed a castaway autograph or<lb>
two; watched the somewhat unparliamentary proceedings<lb>
going on about me, and wondered who in the world all the<lb>
sedate gentlemen were, who kept popping out of odd doors<lb>
here and there, like respectable Jacks-in-the-box. Then I<lb>
wandered over the palatial residence of Mrs. Columbia,<lb>
and examined its many beauties, though I can't say I thought<lb>
her a tidy housekeeper, and didn't admire her taste in pictures;<lb>
for the eye of this humble individual soon wearied of expiring<lb>
patriots, who all appeared to be quitting their earthly tabernacles<lb>
in convulsious, ruffled shirts, and a whirl of torn banners,<lb>
bomb shells, and buff and blue arms and legs.</p>
<p>The statuary also was massive and concrete, but rather<lb>
wearying to examine; for the colossal ladies and gentlemen<lb>
carried no cards of introduction in face or figure;<lb>
so whether the meditative party in a kilt, with well-developed<lb>
legs, shoes like army slippers, and a ponderous<lb>
nose, was Columbus, Cato, or Cockelorum Tibby the tragedian,<lb>
was more than I could tell. Several robust ladies<lb>
attracted me; but which was America and which Pocahontas<lb>
was a mystery; for all affected much looseness<lb>
of costume, dishevelment of hair, swords, arrows, lances,<lb>
scales, and other ornaments quite <hi rend="italics">pass&eacute;</hi> with damsels of<lb>
our day, whose effigies should go down to posterity armed<lb>
<pb n="070">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-083">

<figdesc>Page 070.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with fans, crochet needles, riding whips, and parasols, with<lb>
here and there one holding pen or pencil, rolling-pin or broom.<lb>
The statue of Liberty I recognized at once, for it had no<lb>
pedestal as yet, but stood flat in the mud, with Young America<lb>
most symbollically making dirt pies, and chip forts, in its<lb>
shadow. But high above the squabbling little throng and<lb>
their petty plans, the sun shone full on Liberty's broad<lb>
forehead, and, in her hand, some summer bird had built its<lb>
nest. I accepted the good omen then, and, on the first of<lb>
January, the Emancipation Act gave the statue a nobler and<lb>
more enduring pedestal than any marble or granite ever carved<lb>
and quarried by human hands.</p>
<p>One trip to Georgetown Heights, where cedars sighed overhead,<lb>
dead leaves rustled underfoot, pleasant paths led up and<lb>
down, and a brook wound like a silver snake by the blackened<lb>
ruins of some French Minister's house, through the poor<lb>
gardens of the black washerwomen who congregated there,<lb>
and, passing the cemetery with a murmurous lullaby, rolled<lb>
away to pay its little tribute to the river. This breezy run<lb>
was the last I took; for, on the morrow, came rain and wind:<lb>
and confinement soon proved a powerful reinforcement to the<lb>
enemy, who was quietly preparing to spring a mine, and blow<lb>
me five hundred miles from the position I had taken in what I<lb>
called my Chickahominy Swamp.</p>
<p>Shut up in my room, with no voice, spirits, or books, that<lb>
week was not a holiday, by any means. Finding meals a<lb>
humbug, I stopped away altogether, trusting that if this sparrow<lb>
was of any worth; the Lord would not let it fall to the ground.<lb>
Like a flock of friendly ravens, my sister nurses fed me, not<lb>
only with food for the body, but kind words for the mind;<lb>
and soon, from being half starved, I found myself so beteaed<lb>
and betoasted, petted and served, that I was nearly killed<lb>
<pb n="071">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-084">

<figdesc>Page 071.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with kindness, in spite of cough, headache, a painful consciousness<lb>
of my pleura, and a realizing sense of bones in the human<lb>
frame. From the pleasant house on the hill, the home in the<lb>
heart of Washington, and the Willard caravansary, came<lb>
friends new and old, with bottles, baskets, carriages and invitations<lb>
for the invalid; and daily our Florence Nightingale<lb>
climbed the steep stairs, stealing a moment from her busy life,<lb>
to watch over the stranger, of whom she was as thoughtfully<lb>
tender as any mother. Long may she wave! Whatever others<lb>
may think or say, Nurse Periwinkle is forever grateful; and<lb>
among her relics of that Washington defeat, none is more<lb>
valued than the little book which appeared on her pillow, one<lb>
dreary day; for the D. D. written in it means to her far more<lb>
than Doctor of Divinity.</p>
<p>Being forbidden to meddle with fleshly arms and legs, I<lb>
solaced myself by mending cotton ones, and, as I sat sewing<lb>
at my window, watched the moving panorama that passed<lb>
below; amusing myself with taking notes of the most striking<lb>
figures in it. Long trains of army wagons kept up a perpetual<lb>
rumble from morning till night; ambulances rattled to and fro<lb>
with busy surgeons, nurses taking an airing, or convalescents<lb>
going in parties to be fitted to artificial limbs. Strings of sorry<lb>
looking horses passed, saying as plainly as dumb creatures<lb>
could, &ldquo;Why, in a city full of them, is there no <hi rend="italics">horse</hi>pital<lb>
for us?&rdquo; Often a cart came by, with several rough coffins in<lb>
it, and no mourners following; barouches, with invalid officers,<lb>
rolled round the corner, and carriage loads of pretty children,<lb>
with black coachmen, footmen, and maids. The women who<lb>
took their walks abroad, were so extinguished in three story<lb>
bonnets, with overhanging balconies of flowers, that their<lb>
charms were obscured; and all I can say of them is, that they<lb>
dressed in the worst possible taste, and walked like ducks.</p>

<p>The men did the picturesque, and did it so well that Washington<lb>
looked like a mammoth masquerade. Spanish hats,<lb>
scarlet lined riding cloaks, swords and sashes, high boots and<lb>
bright spurs, beards and mustaches, which made plain faces<lb>
comely, and comely faces heroic; these vanities of the flesh<lb>
transformed our butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers into<lb>
gallant riders of gaily caparisoned horses, much handsomer<lb>
than themselves; and dozens of such figures were constantly<lb>
prancing by, with private prickings of spurs, for the benefit<lb>
of the perambulating flower-bed. Some of these gentlemen<lb>
affected painfully tight uniforms, and little caps, kept on by<lb>
some new law of gravitation, as they covered only the bridge<lb>
of the nose, yet never fell off; the men looked like stuffed<lb>
fowls, and rode as if the safety of the nation depended on<lb>
their speed alone. The fattest, greyest officers dressed most,<lb>
and ambled statelily along, with orderlies behind, trying to<lb>
look as if they didn't know the stout party in front, and doing<lb>
much caracoling on their own account.</p>
<p>The mules were my especial delight; and an hour's study<lb>
of a constant succession of them introduced me to many of<lb>
their characteristics; for six of these odd little beasts drew<lb>
each army wagon, and went hopping like frogs through the<lb>
stream of mud that gently rolled along the street. The<lb>
coquettish mule had small feet, a nicely trimmed tassel of a<lb>
tail, perked up ears, and seemed much given to little tosses of<lb>
the head, affected skips and prances; and, if he wore the<lb>
bells, or were bedizzened with a bit of finery, put on as many<lb>
airs as any belle. The moral mule was a stout, hard-working<lb>
creature, always tugging with all his might; often pulling<lb>
away after the rest had stopped, laboring under the conscientious<lb>
delusion that food for the entire army depended upon his<lb>
private exertions. I respected this style of mule; and, had<lb>
<pb n="073">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-086">

<figdesc>Page 073.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
I possessed a juicy cabbage, would have pressed it upon him,<lb>
with thanks for his excellent example. The historical mule<lb>
was a melo-dramatic quadruped, prone to startling humanity<lb>
by erratic leaps, and wild plunges, much shaking of his<lb>
stubborn head, and lashing out of his vicious heels; now and<lb>
then falling flat, and apparently dying <foreign lang="fr" rend="italics">a la</foreign> Forrest: a gasp &mdash;<lb>
a squirm &mdash; a flop, and so on, till the street was well blocked<lb>
up, the drivers all swearing like demons in bad hats, and the<lb>
chief actor's circulation decidedly quickened by every variety<lb>
of kick, cuff, jerk and haul. When the last breath seemed to<lb>
have left his body, and &ldquo;Doctors were in vain,&rdquo; a sudden<lb>
resurrection took place; and if ever a mule laughed with<lb>
scornful triumph, that was the beast, as he leisurely rose, gave<lb>
a comfortable shake; and, calmly regarding the excited crowd<lb>
seeemed to say &mdash; &ldquo;A hit! a decided hit! for the stupidest<lb>
of animals has bamboozled a dozen men. Now, then! what<lb>
are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> stopping the way for?&rdquo; The pathetic mule was,<lb>
perhaps, the most interesting of all; for, though he always<lb>
seemed to be the smallest, thinnest, weakest of the six, the<lb>
postillion, with big boots, long-tailed coat, and heavy whip,<lb>
was sure to bestride this one, who struggled feebly along, head<lb>
down, coat muddy and rough, eye spiritless and sad, his very<lb>
tail a mortified stump, and the whole beast a picture of meek<lb>
misery, fit to touch a heart of stone. The jovial mule was a<lb>
roly poly, happy-go-lucky little piece of horse-flesh, taking<lb>
everything easily, from cudgeling to caressing; strolling along<lb>
with a roguish twinkle of the eye, and, if the thing were<lb>
possible, would have had his hands in his pockets, and whistled<lb>
as he went. If there ever chanced to be an apple core, a<lb>
stray turnip, or wisp of hay, in the gutter, this Mark Tapley<lb>
was sure to find it, and none of his mates seemed to begrudge<lb>
him his bite. I suspected this fellow was the peacemaker,<lb>

confidant and friend of all the others, for he had a sort of<lb>
&ldquo;Cheer-up,-old-boy,-I'll-pull-you-through&rdquo; look, which was<lb>
exceedingly engaging.</p>
<p>Pigs also possessed attractions for me, never having had<lb>
an opportunity of observing their graces of mind and manner,<lb>
till I came to Washington, whose porcine citizens appeared to<lb>
enjoy a larger liberty than many of its human ones. Stout,<lb>
sedate looking pigs, hurried by each morning to their places<lb>
of business, with a preoccupied air, and sonorous greeting to<lb>
their friends. Genteel pigs, with an extra curl to their tails,<lb>
promenaded in pairs, lunching here and there, like gentlemen<lb>
of leisure. Rowdy pigs pushed the passers by off the side<lb>
walk; tipsy pigs hiccoughed their version of &ldquo;We wont go<lb>
home till morning,&rdquo; from the gutter; and delicate young pigs<lb>
tripped daintily through the mud, as if they plumed themselves<lb>
upon their ankles, and kept themselves particularly<lb>
neat in point of stockings. Maternal pigs, with their interesting<lb>
families, strolled by in the sun; and often the pink,<lb>
baby-like squealers lay down for a nap, with a trust in Providence<lb>
worthy of human imitation.</p>
<p>But more interesting than officers, ladies, mules, or pigs,<lb>
were my colored brothers and sisters, because so unlike the<lb>
respectable members of society I'd known in moral Boston.</p>
<p>Here was the genuine article &mdash; no, not the genuine article<lb>
at all, we must go to Africa for that &mdash; but the sort of creatures<lb>
generations of slavery have made them: obsequious, trickish,<lb>
lazy and ignorant, yet kind-hearted, merry-tempered, quick to<lb>
feel and accept the least token of the brotherly love which is<lb>
slowly teaching the white hand to grasp the black, in this<lb>
great struggle for the liberty of both the races.</p>
<p>Having been warned not to be too rampant on the subject<lb>
of slavery, as secesh principles flourished even under the<lb>

shadow of Father Abraham, I had endeavored to walk discreetly,<lb>
and curb my unruly member; looking about me<lb>
with all my eyes the while, and saving up the result of my<lb>
observations for future use. I had not been there a week<lb>
before the neglected, devil-may care expression in many of<lb>
the faces about me, seemed an urgent appeal to leave nursing<lb>
white bodies, and take some care for these black souls. Much<lb>
as the lazy boys and saucy girls tormented me, I liked them,<lb>
and found that any show of interest or friendliness brought<lb>
out the better traits which live in the most degraded and<lb>
forsaken of us all. I liked their cheerfulness, for the dreariest<lb>
old hag, who scrubbed all day in that pestilential steam,<lb>
gossipped and grinned all the way out, when night set her free<lb>
from drudgery. The girls romped with their dusky sweethearts,<lb>
or tossed their babies, with the tender pride that makes<lb>
mother-love a beautifier to the homeliest face. The men and<lb>
boys sang and whistled all day long; and often, as I held my<lb>
watch, the silence of the night was sweetly broken by some<lb>
chorus from the street, full of real melody, whether the song<lb>
was of heaven, or of hoe-cakes; and, as I listened, I felt that<lb>
we never should doubt nor despair concerning a race which,<lb>
through such griefs and wrongs, still clings to this good gift,<lb>
and seems to solace with it the patient hearts that wait and<lb>
watch and hope until the end.</p>
<p>I expected to have to defend myself from accusations of a<lb>
prejudice against color; but was surprised to find things just<lb>
the other way, and daily shocked some neighbor by treating<lb>
the blacks as I did the whites. The men <hi rend="italics">would</hi> swear at the<lb>
&ldquo;darkies,&rdquo; would put two <hi rend="italics">gs</hi> into negro, and scoff at the idea<lb>
of any good coming from such trash. The nurses were willing<lb>
to be served by the colored people, but seldom thanked them,<lb>
never praised, and scarcely recognized them in the street;<lb>

whereat the blood of two generations of abolitionists waxed<lb>
hot in my veins, and, at the first opportunity, proclaimed itself,<lb>
and asserted the right of free speech as doggedly as the irrepressible<lb>
Folsom herself.</p>
<p>Happening to catch up a funny little black baby, who was<lb>
toddling about the nurses' kitchen, one day, when I went<lb>
down to make a mess for some of my men, a Virginia woman<lb>
standing by elevated her most prominent feature, with a sniff<lb>
of disapprobation, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Miss P.! how can you? I've been here six<lb>
months, and never so much as touched the little toad with a<lb>
poker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More shame for you, ma'am,&rdquo; responded Miss P.; and,<lb>
with the natural perversity of a Yankee, followed up the blow<lb>
by kissing &ldquo;the toad,&rdquo; with ardor. His face was providentially<lb>
as clean and shiny as if his mamma had just polished it<lb>
up with a corner of her apron and a drop from the tea-kettle<lb>
spout, like old Aunt Chloe. This rash act, and the antislavery<lb>
lecture that followed, while one hand stirred gruel for<lb>
sick America, and the other hugged baby Africa, did not<lb>
produce the cheering result which I fondly expected; for my<lb>
comrade henceforth regarded me as a dangerous fanatic, and<lb>
my proteg&eacute; nearly came to his death by insisting on swarming<lb>
up stairs to my room, on all occasions, and being walked on<lb>
like a little black spider.</p>
<p>I waited for New Year's day with more eagerness than I<lb>
had ever known before; and, though it brought me no gift, I<lb>
felt rich in the act of justice so tardily performed toward some<lb>
of those about me. As the bells rung midnight, I electrified<lb>
my room-mate by dancing out of bed, throwing up the<lb>
window, and flapping my handkerchief, with a feeble cheer,<lb>
in answer to the shout of a group of colored men in the street<lb>

below. All night they tooted and tramped, fired crackers,<lb>
sung &ldquo;Glory, Hallelujah,&rdquo; and took comfort, poor souls! in<lb>
their own way. The sky was clear, the moon shone benignly,<lb>
a mild wind blew across the river, and all good omens seemed<lb>
to usher in the dawn of the day whose noontide cannot now<lb>
be long in coming. If the colored people had taken hands<lb>
and danced around the White House, with a few cheers for<lb>
the much abused gentleman who has immortalized himself by<lb>
one just act, no President could have had a finer levee, or one<lb>
to be prouder of.</p>
<p>While these sights and sounds were going on without,<lb>
curious scenes were passing within, and I was learning that<lb>
one of the best methods of fitting oneself to be a nurse in a<lb>
hospital, is to be a patient there. For then only can one wholly<lb>
realize what the men suffer and sigh for; how acts of kindness<lb>
touch and win; how much or little we are to those about us;<lb>
and for the first time really see that in coming there we have<lb>
taken our lives in our hands, and may have to pay dearly for<lb>
a brief experience. Every one was very kind; the attendants<lb>
of my ward often came up to report progress, to fill my woodbox,<lb>
or bring messages and presents from my boys. The<lb>
nurses took many steps with those tired feet of theirs, and<lb>
several came each evening, to chat over my fire and make<lb>
things cosy for the night. The doctors paid daily visits,<lb>
tapped at my lungs to see if pneumonia was within, left doses<lb>
without names, and went away, leaving me as ignorant, and<lb>
much more uncomfortable than when they came. Hours<lb>
began to get confused; people looked odd; queer faces haunted<lb>
the room, and the nights were one long fight with weariness<lb>
and pain. Letters from home grew anxious; the doctors<lb>
lifted their eyebrows, and nodded ominously; friends said<lb>
&ldquo;Don't stay,&rdquo; and an internal rebellion seconded the advice;<lb>
<pb n="078">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-093">

<figdesc>Page 078.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
but the three months were not out, and the idea of giving<lb>
up so soon was proclaiming a defeat before I was fairly routed;<lb>
so to all &ldquo;Don't stays&rdquo; I opposed &ldquo;I wills,&rdquo; till, one fine<lb>
morning, a gray-headed gentleman rose like a welcome ghost<lb>
on my hearth; and, at the sight of him, my resolution melted<lb>
away, my heart turned traitor to my boys, and, when he said,<lb>
&ldquo;Come home,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Yes, father;&rdquo; and so ended<lb>
my career as an army nurse.</p>
<p>I never shall regret the going, though a sharp tussle with<lb>
typhoid, ten dollars, and a wig, are all the visible results of<lb>
the experiment; for one may live and learn much in a month.<lb>
A good fit of illness proves the value of health; real danger<lb>
tries one's mettle; and self-sacrifice sweetens character. Let<lb>
no one who sincerely desires to help the work on in this way,<lb>
delay going through any fear; for the worth of life lies in the<lb>
experiences that fill it, and this is one which cannot be forgotten.<lb>
All that is best and bravest in the hearts of men and women,<lb>
comes out in scenes like these; and, though a hospital is a<lb>
rough school, its lessons are both stern and salutary; and the<lb>
humblest of pupils there, in proportion to his faithfulness,<lb>
learns a deeper faith in God and in himself. I, for one,<lb>
would return tomorrow, on the &ldquo;up-again,-and-take-another&rdquo;<lb>
principle, if I could; for the amount of pleasure and profit I<lb>
got out of that month compensates for all after pangs; and,<lb>
though a sadly womanish feeling, I take some satisfaction in<lb>
the thought that, if I could not lay my head on the altar of<lb>
my country, I have my hair; and that is more than handsome<lb>
Helen did for her dead husband, when she sacrificed only the<lb>
ends of her ringlets on his urn. Therefore, I close this little<lb>
chapter of hospital experiences, with the regret that they were<lb>
no better worth recording; and add the poetical gem with<lb>

<p><hi rend="italics">My Dear S.:</hi> &mdash; As inquiries like your own have come to<lb>
me from various friendly readers of the Sketches, I will<lb>
answer them <hi rend="italics">en masse,</hi> and in printed form, as a sort of<lb>
postscript to what has gone before. One of these questions<lb>
was, &ldquo;Are there no services by hospital death-beds, or on<lb>
Sundays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In most Hospitals I hope there are; in ours, the men died,<lb>
and were carried away, with as little ceremony as on a battle-field.<lb>
The first event of this kind which I witnessed was so<lb>
very brief, and bare of anything like reverence, sorrow, or<lb>
pious consolation, that I heartily agreed with the bluntly<lb>
expressed opinion of a Maine man lying next his comrade,<lb>
who died with no visible help near him, but a compassionate<lb>
woman and a tender-hearted Irishman, who dropped upon his<lb>
knees, and told his beads, with Catholic fervor, for the good<lb>
of his Protestant brother's parting soul:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, after gettin' all the hard knocks, we are left to die<lb>
<pb n="081">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-096">

<figdesc>Page 081.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
this way, with nothing but a Paddy's prayers to help us, I<lb>
guess Christians are rather scarce round Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought so too; but though Miss Blank, one of my<lb>
mates, anxious that souls should be ministered to, as well as<lb>
bodies, spoke more than once to the Chaplain, nothing ever<lb>
came of it. Unlike another Shepherd, whose earnest piety<lb>
weekly purified the Senate Chamber, this man did not feed as<lb>
well as fold his flock, nor make himself a human symbol of the<lb>
Divine Samaritan, who never passes by on the other side.</p>
<p>I have since learned that our non-commital Chaplain had<lb>
been a Professor in some Southern College; and, though he<lb>
maintained that he had no secesh proclivities, I can testify<lb>
that he seceded from his ministerial duties, I may say, skedaddled;<lb>
for, being one of his own words, it is as appropriate<lb>
as inelegant. He read Emerson, quoted Carlyle, and tried to<lb>
be a Chaplain; but, judging from his success, I am afraid he<lb>
still hankered after the hominy pots of Rebeldom.</p>
<p>Occasionally, on a Sunday afternoon, such of the nurses,<lb>
officers, attendants, and patients as could avail themselves of<lb>
it, were gathered in the Ball Room, for an hour's service, of<lb>
which the singing was the better part. To me it seemed that<lb>
if ever strong, wise, and loving words were needed, it was<lb>
then; if ever mortal man had living texts before his eyes to<lb>
illustrate and illuminate his thought, it was there; and if ever<lb>
hearts were prompted to devoutest self-abnegation, it was in<lb>
the work which brought us to anything but a Chapel of Ease.<lb>
But some spiritual paralysis seemed to have befallen our<lb>
pastor; for, though many faces turned toward him, full of the<lb>
dumb hunger that often comes to men when suffering or danger<lb>
brings them nearer to the heart of things, they were offered<lb>
the chaff of divinity, and its wheat was left for less needy<lb>
gleaners, who knew where to look. Even the fine old Bible<lb>
<pb n="082">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-097">

<figdesc>Page 082.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stories, which may be made as lifelike as any history of our<lb>
day, by a vivid fancy and pictorial diction, were robbed of all<lb>
their charms by dry explanations and literal applications,<lb>
instead of being useful and pleasant lessons to those men,<lb>
whom weakness had rendered as docile as children in a father's<lb>
hands.</p>
<p>I watched the listless countenances all about me, while<lb>
we listened to a dull sermon, delivered with a monotonous<lb>
tone, a business-like manner, and a very visible desire to<lb>
get the uninteresting job done as expeditiously as possible;<lb>
which demonstrations were most successful in making the<lb>
Sunday services a duty, not a pleasure. Listless they were<lb>
at the beginning, and listless at the end; but the instant<lb>
some stirring old hymn was given out, sleepy eyes brightened,<lb>
lounging figures sat erect, and many a poor lad<lb>
rose up in his bed, or stretched an eager hand for the<lb>
book, while all broke out with a heartiness that proved<lb>
that somewhere at the core of even the most abandoned,<lb>
there still glowed some remnant of the native piety that<lb>
flows in music from the heart of every little child. Even<lb>
the big rebel joined, and boomed away in a thunderous bass,<lb>
singing &mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;Salvation! let the echoes fly,&rdquo;</p></q>
as energetically as if he felt the need of a speedy execution<lb>
of the command.</p>
<p>That was the pleasantest moment of the hour, for then it<lb>
seemed a homelike and happy spot; the groups of men looking<lb>
over one another's shoulders as they sang; the few silent<lb>
figures in the beds; here and there a woman noiselessly performing<lb>
some necessary duty, and singing as she worked;<lb>
<pb n="083">

</eaffig>
while in the arm chair standing in the midst, I placed, for my<lb>
own satisfaction, the imaginary likeness of a certain faithful<lb>
pastor, who took all outcasts by the hand, smote the devil in<lb>
whatever guise he came, and comforted the indigent in spirit<lb>
with the best wisdom of a great and tender heart, which still<lb>
speaks to us from its Italian grave. With that addition, my<lb>
picture was complete; and I often longed to take a veritable<lb>
sketch of a Hospital Sunday, for, despite its drawbacks,<lb>
consisting of continued labor, the want of proper books, the<lb>
barren preaching that bore no fruit, this day was never like<lb>
the other six.</p>
<p>True to their home training, our New England boys did<lb>
their best to make it what it should be. With many, there<lb>
was much reading of Testaments, humming over of favorite<lb>
hymns, and looking at such books as I could cull from a<lb>
miscellaneous library. Some lay idle, slept, or gossiped; yet,<lb>
when I came to them for a quiet evening chat or reading,<lb>
they often talked freely and well of themselves; would<lb>
blunder out some timid hope that their troubles might<lb>
&ldquo;do 'em good, and keep 'em stiddy;&rdquo; would choke a<lb>
little, as they said good night, and turned their faces to<lb>
the wall to think of mother, wife, or home, these human<lb>
ties seeming to be the most vital religion which they yet<lb>
knew. I observed that some of them did not wear their<lb>
caps on this day, though at other times they clung to them<lb>
like Quakers; wearing them in bed, putting them on to<lb>
read the paper, eat an apple, or write a letter, as if, like a<lb>
new sort of Samson, their strength lay, not in their hair, but in<lb>
their hats. Many read no novels, swore less, were more silent,<lb>
orderly, and cheerful, as if the Lord were an invisible Wardmaster,<lb>
who went his rounds but once a week, and must find<lb>
all things at their best. I liked all this in the poor, rough<lb>
boys, and could have found it in my heart to put down sponge<lb>
<pb n="084">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-099">

<figdesc>Page 084.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and tea-pot, and preach a little sermon then and there, while<lb>
homesickness and pain had made these natures soft, that some<lb>
good seed might be cast therein, to blossom and bear fruit<lb>
here or hereafter.</p>
<p>Regarding the admission of friends to nurse their sick, I<lb>
can only say, it was not allowed at Hurlyburly House; though<lb>
one indomitable parent took my ward by storm, and held her<lb>
position, in spite of doctors, matron, and Nurse Periwinkle.<lb>
Though it was against the rules, though the culprit was an<lb>
acid, frost-bitten female, though the young man would have<lb>
done quite as well without her anxious fussiness, and the whole<lb>
room-full been much more comfortable, there was something so<lb>
irresistible in this persistent devotion, that no one had the<lb>
heart to oust her from her post. She slept on the floor, without<lb>
uttering a complaint; bore jokes somewhat of the rudest;<lb>
fared scantily, though her basket was daily filled with luxuries<lb>
for her boy; and tended that petulant personage with a neverfailing<lb>
patience beautiful to see.</p>
<p>I feel a glow of moral rectitude in saying this of her; for,<lb>
though a perfect pelican to her young, she pecked and cackled<lb>
(I don't know that pelicans usually express their emotions in<lb>
that manner,) most obstreperously, when others invaded her<lb>
premises; and led me a weary life, with &ldquo;George's tea-rusks,&rdquo;<lb>
&ldquo;George's foot-bath,&rdquo; &ldquo;George's measles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;George's<lb>
mother;&rdquo; till, after a sharp passage of arms and tongues with<lb>
the matron, she wrathfully packed up her rusks, her son, and<lb>
herself, and departed, in an ambulance, scolding to the very<lb>
last.</p>
<p>This is the comic side of the matter. The serious one is<lb>
harder to describe; for the presence, however brief, of relations<lb>
and friends by the bedsides of the dead or dying, is<lb>
always a trial to the bystanders. They are not near enough<lb>

to know how best to comfort, yet too near to turn their backs<lb>
upon the sorrow that finds its only solace in listening to<lb>
recitals of last words, breathed into nurse's ears, or receiving<lb>
the tender legacies of love and longing bequeathed through<lb>
them.</p>
<p>To me, the saddest sight I saw in that sad place, was the<lb>
spectacle of a grey-haired father, sitting hour after hour by<lb>
his son, dying from the poison of his wound. The old father,<lb>
hale and hearty; the young son, past all help, though one<lb>
could scarcely believe it; for the subtle fever, burning his<lb>
strength away, flushed his cheeks with color, filled his eyes<lb>
with lustre, and lent a mournful mockery of health to face and<lb>
figure, making the poor lad comelier in death than in life.<lb>
His bed was not in my ward; but I was often in and out,<lb>
and, for a day or two, the pair were much together, saying<lb>
little, but looking much. The old man tried to busy himself<lb>
with book or pen, that his presence might not be a burden;<lb>
and once when he sat writing, to the anxious mother at home,<lb>
doubtless, I saw the son's eyes fixed upon his face, with a look<lb>
of mingled resignation and regret, as if endeavoring to teach<lb>
himself to say cheerfully the long good bye. And again,<lb>
when the son slept, the father watched him, as he had himself<lb>
been watched; and though no feature of his grave countenance<lb>
changed, the rough hand, smoothing the lock of hair<lb>
upon the pillow, the bowed attitude of the grey head, were<lb>
more pathetic than the loudest lamentations. The son died;<lb>
and the father took home the pale relic of the life he gave,<lb>
offering a little money to the nurse, as the only visible return<lb>
it was in his power to make her; for, though very grateful,<lb>
he was poor. Of course, she did not take it, but found a<lb>
richer compensation in the old man's earnest declaration:<lb>

<p>&ldquo;My boy couldn't have been better cared for if he'd been at<lb>
home; and God will reward you for it, though I can't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My own experiences of this sort began when my first man<lb>
died. He had scarcely been removed, when his wife came in.<lb>
Her eye went straight to the well-known bed; it was empty;<lb>
and feeling, yet not believing the hard truth, she cried out,<lb>
with a look I never shall forget:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where's Emanuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never seen her before, did not know her relationship<lb>
to the man whom I had only nursed for a day, and was about<lb>
to tell her he was gone, when McGee, the tender-hearted<lb>
Irishman before mentioned, brushed by me with a cheerful &mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;It's shifted to a better bed he is, Mrs. Connel. Come out,<lb>
dear, till I show ye;&rdquo; and, taking her gently by the arm, he<lb>
led her to the matron, who broke the heavy tidings to the<lb>
wife, and comforted the widow.</p>
<p>Another day, running up to my room for a breath of fresh<lb>
air and a five minutes' rest after a disagreeable task, I found<lb>
a stout young woman sitting on my bed, wearing the miserable<lb>
look which I had learned to know by that time. Seeing<lb>
her, reminded me that I had heard of some one's dying in the<lb>
night, and his sister's arriving in the morning. This must be<lb>
she, I thought. I pitied her with all my heart. What could<lb>
I say or do? Words always seem impertinent at such times;<lb>
I did not know the man; the woman was neither interesting<lb>
in herself nor graceful in her grief; yet, having known a<lb>
sister's sorrow myself, I could not leave her alone with her<lb>
trouble in that strange place, without a word. So, feeling<lb>
heart-sick, home-sick, and not knowing what else to do, I just<lb>
put my arms about her, and began to cry in a very helpless<lb>
but hearty way; for, as I seldom indulge in this moist luxury,<lb>
I like to enjoy it with all my might, when I do.</p>
<pb n="087">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-102">

<figdesc>Page 087.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>It so happened I could not have done a better thing; for,<lb>
though not a word was spoken, each felt the other's sympathy;<lb>
and, in the silence, our handkerchiefs were more eloquent<lb>
than words. She soon sobbed herself quiet; and, leaving her<lb>
on my bed, I went back to work, feeling much refreshed by<lb>
the shower, though I'd forgotten to rest, and had washed my<lb>
face instead of my hands. I mention this successful experiment<lb>
as a receipt proved and approved, for the use of any<lb>
nurse who may find herself called upon to minister to these<lb>
wounds of the heart. They will find it more efficacious than<lb>
cups of tea, smelling-bottles, psalms, or sermons; for a friendly<lb>
touch and a companionable cry, unite the consolations of all<lb>
the rest for womankind; and, if genuine, will be found a<lb>
sovereign cure for the first sharp pang so many suffer in these<lb>
heavy times.</p>
<p>I am gratified to find that my little Sergeant has found<lb>
favor in several quarters, and gladly respond to sundry calls<lb>
for news of him, though my personal knowledge ended five<lb>
months ago. Next to my good John &mdash; I hope the grass is<lb>
green above him, far away there in Virginia! &mdash; I placed the<lb>
Sergeant on my list of worthy boys; and many a jovial chat<lb>
have I enjoyed with the merry-hearted lad, who had a fancy<lb>
for fun, when his poor arm was dressed. While Dr. P. poked<lb>
and strapped, I brushed the remains of the Sergeant's brown<lb>
mane &mdash; shorn sorely against his will &mdash; and gossiped with all<lb>
my might, the boy making odd faces, exclamations, and<lb>
appeals, when nerves got the better of nonsense, as they<lb>
sometimes did:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd rather laugh than cry, when I must sing out anyhow,<lb>
so just say that bit from Dickens again, please, and I'll stand<lb>
it like a man.&rdquo; He did; for &ldquo;Mrs. Cluppins,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chadband,&rdquo;<lb>
and &ldquo;Sam Weller,&rdquo; always helped him through;<lb>
<pb n="088">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-103">

<figdesc>Page 088.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
thereby causing me to lay another offering of love and admiration<lb>
on the shrine of the god of my idolatry, though he does<lb>
wear too much jewelry and talk slang.</p>
<p>The Sergeant also originated, I believe, the fashion of calling<lb>
his neighbors by their afflictions instead of their names; and I<lb>
was rather taken aback by hearing them bandy remarks of<lb>
this sort, with perfect good humor and much enjoyment of the<lb>
new game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, old Fits is off again!&rdquo; &ldquo;How are you, Rheumatiz?&rdquo;<lb>
&ldquo;Will you trade apples, Ribs?&rdquo; &ldquo;I say, Miss P.,<lb>
may I give Typus a drink of this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Look here, No Toes,<lb>
lend us a stamp, there's a good feller,&rdquo; etc. He himself was<lb>
christened &ldquo;Baby B.,&rdquo; because he tended his arm on a little<lb>
pillow, and called it his infant.</p>
<p>Very fussy about his food was Sergeant B., and much<lb>
trotting of attendants was necessary when he partook of nourishment.<lb>
Anything more irresistibly wheedlesome I never<lb>
saw, and constantly found myself indulging him, like the most<lb>
weak-minded parent, merely for the pleasure of seeing his<lb>
blue eyes twinkle, his merry mouth break into a smile, and<lb>
his one hand execute a jaunty little salute that was entirely<lb>
captivating. I am afraid that Nurse P. damaged her dignity,<lb>
frolicking with this persuasive young gentleman, though done<lb>
for his well-being. But &ldquo;boys will be boys,&rdquo; is perfectly<lb>
applicable to the case; for, in spite of years, sex, and the<lb>
&ldquo;prunes-and-prisms&rdquo; doctrine laid down for our use, I have<lb>
a fellow feeling for lads, and always owed Fate a grudge<lb>
because I wasn't a lord of creation instead of a lady.</p>
<p>Since I left, I have heard, from a reliable source, that my<lb>
Sergeant has gone home; therefore, the small romance that<lb>
budded the first day I saw him, has blossomed into its second<lb>
chapter; and I now imagine &ldquo;dearest Jane&rdquo; filling my place,<lb>
<pb n="089">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-104">

<figdesc>Page 089.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
tending the wounds I tended, brushing the curly jungle I<lb>
brushed, loving the excellent little youth I loved, and eventually<lb>
walking altarward, with the Sergeant stumping gallantly<lb>
at her side. If she doesn't do all this, and no end more, I'll<lb>
never forgive her; and sincerely pray to the guardian saint<lb>
of lovers, that &ldquo;Baby B.&rdquo; may prosper in his wooing, and<lb>
his name be long in the land.</p>
<p>One of the lively episodes of hospital life, is the frequent<lb>
marching away of such as are well enough to rejoin their<lb>
regiments, or betake themselves to some convalescent camp.<lb>
The ward master comes to the door of each room that is to be<lb>
thinned, reads off a list of names, bids their owners look<lb>
sharp and be ready when called for; and, as he vanishes, the<lb>
rooms fall into an indescribable state of topsy-turvyness, as<lb>
the boys begin to black their boots, brighten spurs, brush<lb>
clothes, overhaul knapsacks, make presents; are fitted out<lb>
with needfuls, and &mdash; well, why not? &mdash; kissed sometimes, as<lb>
they say, good by; for in all human probability we shall<lb>
never meet again, and a woman's heart yearns over anything<lb>
that has clung to her for help and comfort. I never liked<lb>
these breakings-up of my little household; though my short<lb>
stay showed me but three. I was immensely gratified by the<lb>
hand shakes I got, for their somewhat painful cordiality assured<lb>
me that I had not tried in vain. The big Prussian rumbled<lb>
out his unintelligible <hi rend="italics">adieux,</hi> with a grateful face and a<lb>
premonitory smooth of his yellow moustache, but got no<lb>
farther, for some ene else stepped up, with a large brown hand<lb>
extended, and this recommendation of our very faulty establishment:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We're off, ma'am, and I'm powerful sorry, for I'd no idea<lb>
a 'orspittle was such a jolly place. Hope I'll git another ball<lb>
<pb n="090">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-105">

<figdesc>Page 090.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
somewheres easy, so I'll come back, and be took care on<lb>
again. Mean, ain't it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn't think so, but the doctrine of inglorious ease was<lb>
not the the right one to preach up, so I tried to look shocked,<lb>
failed signally, and consoled myself by giving him the fat<lb>
pincushion he had admired as the &ldquo;cutest little machine<lb>
agoin.&rdquo; Then they fell into line in front of the house, looking<lb>
rather wan and feeble, some of them, but trying to step out<lb>
smartly and march in good order, though half the knapsacks<lb>
were carried by the guard, and several leaned on sticks instead<lb>
of shouldering guns. All looked up and smiled, or waved<lb>
heir hands and touched their caps, as they passed under our<lb>
windows down the long street, and so away, some to their<lb>
homes in this world, and some to that in the next; and, for<lb>
the rest of the day, I felt like Rachel mourning for her<lb>
children, when I saw the empty beds and missed the familiar<lb>
faces.</p>
<p>You ask if nurses are obliged to witness amputations and<lb>
such matters, as a part of their duty? I think not, unless<lb>
they wish; for the patient is under the effects of ether, and<lb>
needs no care but such as the surgeons can best give. Our<lb>
work begins afterward, when the poor soul comes to himself,<lb>
sick, faint, and wandering; full of strange pains and confused<lb>
visions, of disagreeable sensations and sights. Then we must<lb>
sooth and sustain, tend and watch; preaching and practicing<lb>
patience, till sleep and time have restored courage and self-control.<lb>
</p>
<p>I witnessed several operations; for the height of my ambition<lb>
was to go to the front after a battle, and feeling that the sooner<lb>
I inured myself to trying sights, the more useful I should be.<lb>
Several of my mates shrunk from such things; for though the<lb>
<pb n="091">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-106">

<figdesc>Page 091.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
spirit was wholly willing, the flesh was inconveniently weak.<lb>
One funereal lady came to try her powers as a nurse; but, a<lb>
brief conversation eliciting the facts that she fainted at the<lb>
sight of blood, was afraid to watch alone, couldn't possibly<lb>
take care of delirious persons, was nervous about infections,<lb>
and unable to bear much fatigue, she was mildly dismissed.<lb>
I hope she found her sphere, but fancy a comfortable bandbox<lb>
on a high shelf would best meet the requirements of her case.</p>
<p>Dr. Z. suggested that I should witness a dissection; but I<lb>
never accepted his invitations, thinking that my nerves belonged<lb>
to the living, not to the dead, and I had better finish my education<lb>
as a nurse before I began that of a surgeon. But I<lb>
never met the little man skipping through the hall, with oddly<lb>
shaped cases in his hand, and an absorbed expression of countenance,<lb>
without being sure that a select party of surgeons<lb>
were at work in the dead house, which idea was a rather trying<lb>
one, when I knew the subject was some person whom I had<lb>
nursed and cared for.</p>
<p>But this must not lead any one to suppose that the surgeons<lb>
were willfully hard or cruel, though one of them remorsefully<lb>
confided to me that he feared his profession blunted his sensibilities,<lb>
and, perhaps, rendered him indifferent to the sight of<lb>
pain.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that in some cases it does; for, though<lb>
a capital surgeon and a kindly man, Dr. P., through long<lb>
acquaintance with many of the ills flesh is heir to, had acquired<lb>
a somewhat trying habit of regarding a man and his wound as<lb>
separate institutions, and seemed rather annoyed that the<lb>
former should express any opinion upon the latter, or claim<lb>
any right in it, while under his care. He had a way of<lb>
twitching off a bandage, and giving a limb a comprehensive<lb>
sort of clutch, which, though no doubt entirely scientific, was<lb>
<pb n="092">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-107">

<figdesc>Page 092.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
rather startling than soothing, and highly objectionable as a<lb>
means of preparing nerves for any fresh trial. He also<lb>
expected the patient to assist in small operations, as he considered<lb>
them, and to restrain all demonstrations during the<lb>
process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my man, just hold it this way, while I look into it<lb>
a bit,&rdquo; he said one day to Fitz G., putting a wounded arm<lb>
into the keeping of a sound one, and proceeding to poke<lb>
about among bits of bone and visible muscles, in a red and<lb>
black chasm made by some infernal machine of the shot or<lb>
shell description. Poor Fitz held on like grim Death, ashamed<lb>
to show fear before a woman, till it grew more than he could<lb>
bear in silence; and, after a few smothered groans, he looked<lb>
at me imploringly, as if he said, &ldquo;I wouldn't, ma'am, if I<lb>
could help it,&rdquo; and fainted quietly away.</p>
<p>Dr. P. looked up, gave a compassionate sort of cluck, and<lb>
poked away more busily than ever, with a nod at me and a<lb>
brief &mdash; &ldquo;Never mind; be so good as to hold this till I finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed, cherishing the while a strong desire to insinuate a<lb>
few of his own disagreeable knives and scissors into him, and<lb>
see how he liked it. A very disrespectful and ridiculous<lb>
fancy, of course; for he was doing all that could be done,<lb>
and the arm prospered finely in his hands. But the human<lb>
mind is prone to prejudice; and, though a personable man,<lb>
speaking French like a born &ldquo;Parley voo,&rdquo; and whipping off<lb>
legs like an animated guillotine, I must confess to a sense of<lb>
relief when he was ordered elsewhere; and suspect that several<lb>
of the men would have faced a rebel battery with less trepidation<lb>
than they did Dr. P., when he came briskly in on his<lb>
morning round.</p>
<p>As if to give us the pleasures of contrast, Dr. Z. succeeded<lb>
him, who, I think, suffered more in giving pain than did his<lb>
<pb n="093">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-108">

<figdesc>Page 093.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
patients in enduring it; for he often paused to ask: &ldquo;Do I<lb>
hurt you?&rdquo; and, seeing his solicitude, the boys invariably<lb>
answered: &ldquo;Not much; go ahead, Doctor,&rdquo; though the lips<lb>
that uttered this amiable fib might be white with pain as they<lb>
spoke. Over the dressing of some of the wounds, we used<lb>
to carry on conversations upon subjects foreign to the work in<lb>
hand, that the patient might forget himself in the charms of<lb>
our discourse. Christmas eve was spent in this way; the<lb>
Doctor strapping the little Sergeant's arm, I holding the lamp,<lb>
while all three laughed and talked, as if anywhere but in a<lb>
hospital ward; except when the chat was broken by a longdrawn<lb>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; from &ldquo;Baby B.,&rdquo; an abrupt request from the<lb>
Doctor to &ldquo;Hold the lamp a little higher, please,&rdquo; or an<lb>
encouraging, &ldquo;Most through, Sergeant,&rdquo; from Nurse P.</p>
<p>The chief Surgeon, Dr. O., I was told, refused the higher<lb>
salary, greater honor, and less labor, of an appointment to<lb>
the Officer's Hospital, round the corner, that he might serve<lb>
the poor fellows at Hurlyburly House, or go to the front,<lb>
working there day and night, among the horrors that succeed<lb>
the glories of a battle. I liked that so much, that the quiet,<lb>
brown-eyed Doctor was my especial admiration; and when my<lb>
own turn came, had more faith in him than in all the rest<lb>
put together, although he did advise me to go home, and<lb>
authorize the consumption of blue pills.</p>
<p>Speaking of the surgeons reminds me that, having found all<lb>
manner of fault, it becomes me to celebrate the redeeming<lb>
feature of Hurlyburly House. I had been prepared by the<lb>
accounts of others, to expect much humiliation of spirit from<lb>
the surgeons, and to be treated by them like a door-mat, a<lb>
worm, or any other meek and lowly article, whose mission it<lb>
is to be put down and walked upon; nurses being considered<lb>
as mere servants, receiving the lowest pay, and, it's my private<lb>
<pb n="094">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-109">

<figdesc>Page 094.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
opinion, doing the hardest work of any part of the army,<lb>
except the mules. Great, therefore, was my surprise, when I<lb>
found myself treated with the utmost courtesy and kindness.<lb>
Very soon my carefully prepared meekness was laid upon the<lb>
shelf; and, going from one extreme to the other, I more than<lb>
once expressed a difference of opinion regarding sundry messes<lb>
it was my painful duty to administer.</p>
<p>As eight of us nurses chanced to be off duty at once, we<lb>
had an excellent opportunity of trying the virtues of these<lb>
gentlemen; and I am bound to say they stood the test admirably,<lb>
as far as my personal observation went. Dr. O.'s<lb>
stethescope was unremitting in its attentions; Dr. S. brought<lb>
his buttons into my room twice a day, with the regularity of a<lb>
medical clock; while Dr. Z. filled my table with neat little<lb>
bottles, which I never emptied, prescribed Browning, bedewed<lb>
me with Cologne, and kept my fire going, as if, like the<lb>
candles in St. Peter's, it must never be permitted to die out.<lb>
Waking one cold night, with the certainty that my last spark<lb>
had expired, and consequently hours of coughing were in<lb>
store for me, I was much amazed to see a ruddy light dancing<lb>
on the wall, a jolly blaze roaring up the chimney, and, down<lb>
upon his knees before it, Dr. Z., whittling shavings. I ought<lb>
to have risen up and thanked him on the spot; but, knowing<lb>
that he was one of those who like to do good by stealth, I<lb>
only peeped at him as if he were a friendly ghost; till, having<lb>
made things as cozy as the most motherly of nurses could<lb>
have done, he crept away, leaving me to feel, as somebody<lb>
says, &ldquo;as if angels were a watching of me in my sleep;&rdquo;<lb>
though that species of wild fowl do not usually descend in<lb>
broadcloth and glasses. I afterwards discovered that he split<lb>
the wood himself on that cool January midnight, and went<lb>
about making or mending fires for the poor old ladies in their<lb>
<pb n="095">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-110">

<figdesc>Page 095.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
dismal dens; thus causing himself to be regarded as a bright<lb>
and shining light in more ways than one. I never thanked him<lb>
as I ought; therefore, I publicly make a note of it, and further<lb>
aggravate that modest M. D. by saying that if this was not<lb>
being the best of doctors and the gentlest of gentlemen, I shall<lb>
be happy to see any improvement upon it.</p>
<p>To such as wish to know where these scenes took place, I<lb>
must respectfully decline to answer; for Hurly-burly House<lb>
has ceased to exist as a hospital; so let it rest, with all its<lb>
sins upon its head, &mdash; perhaps I should say chimney top.<lb>
When the nurses felt ill, the doctors departed, and the patients<lb>
got well, I believe the concern gently faded from existence, or<lb>
was merged into some other and better establishment, where I<lb>
hope the washing of three hundred sick people is done out of<lb>
the house, the food is eatable, and mortal women are not<lb>
expected to possess an angelic exemption from all wants, and<lb>
the endurance of truck horses.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of these hasty Sketches, I have heard<lb>
from several of my comrades at the Hospital; and their<lb>
approval assures me that I have not let sympathy and fancy<lb>
run away with me, as that lively team is apt to do when<lb>
harnessed to a pen. As no two persons see the same thing<lb>
with the same eyes, my view of hospital life must be taken<lb>
through my glass, and held for what it is worth. Certainly,<lb>
nothing was set down in malice, and to the serious-minded<lb>
party who objected to a tone of levity in some portions of the<lb>
Sketches, I can only say that it is a part of my religion to<lb>
look well after the cheerfulnesses of life, and let the dismals<lb>
shift for themselves; believing, with good Sir Thomas More,<lb>
that it is wise to &ldquo;be merrie in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next hospital I enter will, I hope, be one for the<lb>
colored regiments, as they seem to be proving their right to<lb>
<pb n="096">

the admiration and kind offices of their white relations, who<lb>
owe them so large a debt, a little part of which I shall be<lb>
proud to pay.</p>

<p>FIVE-and-twenty ladies, all in a row, sat on one side<lb>
of the hall, looking very much as if they felt like the<lb>
little old woman who fell asleep on the king's highway<lb>
and awoke with abbreviated drapery, for they were all<lb>
arrayed in gray tunics and Turkish continuations, profusely<lb>
adorned with many-colored trimmings. Five-and-twenty<lb>
gentlemen, all in a row, sat on the opposite side<lb>
of the hall, looking somewhat subdued, as men are apt to<lb>
do when they fancy they are in danger of making fools<lb>
of themselves. They, also, were <hi rend="italics">en</hi> costume, for all the<lb>
dark ones had grown piratical in red shirts, the light ones<lb>
nautical in blue; and a few boldly appeared in white,<lb>
making up in starch and studs what they lost in color,<lb>
while all were more or less Byronic as to collar.</p>
<p>On the platform appeared a pile of dumb-bells, a<lb>
regiment of clubs, and a pyramid of bean-bags, and<lb>
stirring nervously among them a foreign-looking gentleman,<lb>
the new leader of a class lately formed by<lb>
Dr. Thor Turner, whose mission it was to strengthen<lb>
the world's spine, and convert it to a belief in air and<lb>

exercise, by setting it to balancing its poles and spinning<lb>
merrily, while enjoying the &ldquo;Sun-cure&rdquo; on a large scale.<lb>
His advent formed an epoch in the history of the town;<lb>
for it was a quiet old village, guiltless of bustle, fashion,<lb>
or parade, where each man stood for what he was; and,<lb>
being a sagacious set, every one's true value was pretty<lb>
accurately known. It was a neighborly town, with<lb>
gossip enough to stir the social atmosphere with small<lb>
gusts of interest or wonder, yet do no harm. A sensible,<lb>
free-and-easy town, for the wisest man in it wore the<lb>
worst boots, and no one thought the less of his understanding;<lb>
the belle of the village went shopping with<lb>
a big sun-bonnet and tin pail, and no one found her<lb>
beauty lessened; oddities of all sorts ambled peacefully<lb>
about on their various hobbies, and no one suggested<lb>
the expediency of a trip on the wooden horse upon<lb>
which the chivalrous South is always eager to mount<lb>
an irrepressible abolitionist. Restless people were soothed<lb>
by the lullaby the river sang in its slow journey to the<lb>
sea, old people found here a pleasant place to make<lb>
ready to die in, young people to survey the world from,<lb>
before taking their first flight, and strangers looked back<lb>
upon it, as a quiet nook full of ancient legends and<lb>
modern lights, which would keep its memory green<lb>
when many a gayer spot was quite forgotten. Anything<lb>
based upon common sense found favor with the inhabitants,<lb>
and Dr. Turner's theories, being eminently so,<lb>
were accepted at once, and energetically carried out. A<lb>
sort of heathen revival took place, for even the ministers<lb>
and deacons turned Musselmen; old ladies tossed bean-bags<lb>
till their caps were awry, and winter-roses blossomed<lb>
on their cheeks; school-children proved the worth<lb>
<pb n="101">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-116">

<figdesc>Page 101.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of the old proverb, &ldquo;An ounce of prevention is worth a<lb>
pound of cure,&rdquo; by getting their backs ready before the<lb>
burdens came; pale girls grew blithe and strong swinging<lb>
their dumb namesakes; and jolly lads marched to and<lb>
fro embracing clubs as if longevity were corked up in<lb>
those wooden bottles, and they all took &ldquo;modest quenchers&rdquo;<lb>
by the way.</p>
<p>August Bopp, the new leader of the class, was a German<lb>
possessing but a small stock of English, though a<lb>
fine gymnast; and being also a bashful man, the appointed<lb>
moment had no sooner arrived than he found his carefully<lb>
prepared sentences slipping away from his memory<lb>
as the ice appears to do from under unhappy souls first<lb>
mounted upon skates. An awful silence reigned: Mr.<lb>
Bopp glanced nervously over his shoulder at the staring<lb>
rows, more appalling in their stillness than if they had<lb>
risen up and hooted at him; then piling up the bags for<lb>
the seventh time, he gave himself a mental shake, and,<lb>
with a crimson visage, was about to launch his first<lb>
&ldquo;Ladees und gentlemen,&rdquo; when the door opened, and a<lb>
small, merry-faced figure appeared, looking quite at ease<lb>
in the novel dress, as, with a comprehensive nod, it<lb>
marched straight across the hall to its place among the<lb>
weaker vessels.</p>
<p>A general glance of approbation followed from the gentlemen's<lb>
side, a welcoming murmur ran along the ladies',<lb>
and the fifty pairs of eyes changed their focus for a moment.<lb>
Taking advantage of which, Mr. Bopp righted<lb>
himself, and burst out with a decided, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladees und gentlemen: the time have arrived that<lb>
we shall begin. Will the gentlemen serve the ladees to a<lb>
<pb n="102">

<figdesc>Page 102.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
wand, each one, then spread theirselves about the hall,<lb>
and follow the motions I will make as I shall count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes of chaos, then all fell into order, and<lb>
nothing was heard but the leader's voice and the stir of<lb>
many bodies movings imultaneously. An uninitiated observer<lb>
would have thought himself in Bedlam; for, as the<lb>
evening wore on, the laws of society seemed given to the<lb>
winds, and humanity gone mad. Bags flew in all directions,<lb>
clubs hurtled through the air, and dumb-bells played<lb>
a castinet accompaniment to peals of laughter that made<lb>
better music than any band. Old and young gave themselves<lb>
up to the universal merriment, and, setting dignity<lb>
aside, played like happy-hearted children for an hour.<lb>
Stout Dr. Quackenboss gasped twice round the hall on<lb>
one toe; stately Mrs. Primmins ran like a girl of fifteen<lb>
to get her pins home before her competitor; Tommy<lb>
Inches, four feet three, trotted away with Deacon Stone<lb>
on his shoulder, while Mr. Steepleton and Miss Maypole<lb>
hopped together like a pair of lively young ostriches, and<lb>
Ned Amandine, the village beau, blew arrows through a<lb>
pop-gun, like a modern Cupid in pegtops instead of<lb>
pinions.</p>
<p>The sprightly young lady whose entrance had been so<lb>
opportune seemed a universal favorite, and was overwhelmed<lb>
with invitations to &ldquo;bag,&rdquo; &ldquo;hop,&rdquo; and &ldquo;blow&rdquo;<lb>
from the gentlemen who hovered about her, cheerfully<lb>
distorting themselves to the verge of dislocation in order<lb>
to win a glance of approbation from the merry black<lb>
eyes which were the tapers where all these muscular<lb>
moths singed their wings. Mr. Bopp had never seen such<lb>
a little piece of earnestness before, and began to think<lb>
the young lady must be training for a boat-race or the<lb>
<pb n="103">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-118">

<figdesc>Page 103.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
ring. Her dumb-bells flew about till a pair of white<lb>
arms looked like the sails of a windmill; she hit out<lb>
from the shoulder with a vigor that would have done<lb>
execution had there been anything but empty air to<lb>
&ldquo;punish&rdquo;; and the &ldquo;one, two, three!&rdquo; of the Zouave<lb>
movement went off with a snap; while the color deepened<lb>
from pink to scarlet in her cheeks, the black braids<lb>
tumbled down upon her shoulders, and the clasp of her<lb>
belt flew asunder; but her eye seldom left the leader's<lb>
face, and she followed every motion with an agility and<lb>
precision quite inspiring. Mr. Bopp's courage rose as<lb>
he watched her, and a burning desire to excel took possession<lb>
of him, till he felt as if his muscles were made<lb>
of india-rubber, and his nerves of iron. He went into<lb>
his work heart and soul, shaking a brown mane out of<lb>
his eyes, issuing commands like a general at the head of<lb>
his troops, and keeping both interest and fun in full blast<lb>
till people laughed who had not laughed heartily for years;<lb>
lungs got their fill for once, unsuspected muscles were<lb>
suddenly developed, and when the clock struck ten, all<lb>
were bubbling over with that innocent jollity which<lb>
makes youth worth possessing, and its memory the sunshine<lb>
of old age.</p>
<p>The last exercise was drawing to a close, and a large<lb>
ring of respectable members of society were violently<lb>
sitting down and rising up in a manner which would have<lb>
scandalized Miss Wilhelmina Carolina Amelia Skeggs to<lb>
the last degree, when Mr. Bopp was seen to grow very<lb>
pale, and drop in a manner which it was evident his<lb>
pupils were not expected to follow.</p>
<p>At this unexpected performance, the gentlemen took<lb>
advantage of their newly-acquired agility to fly over all<lb>
<pb n="104">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-119">

<figdesc>Page 104.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
obstacles and swarm on to the platform, while the ladies<lb>
successfully lessened their unusual bloom by staring wildly<lb>
at one another and suggesting awful impossibilities. The<lb>
bustle subsided as suddenly as it arose; and Mr. Bopp,<lb>
rather damp about the head and dizzy about the eye, but<lb>
quite composed, appeared, saying, with the broken English<lb>
and appealing manner which caused all the ladies to<lb>
pronounce him &ldquo;a dear&rdquo; on the spot, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will excoose me for making this lesson to<lb>
be more short than it should; but I have exercise nine<lb>
hours this day, and being just got well from a illness, I<lb>
have not recover the strength I have lost. Next week I<lb>
shall be able to take time by the hair, so that I will not<lb>
have so much engagements in one day. I thank you for<lb>
your kindness, and say good-efening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a round of applause, as a last vent for their<lb>
spirits, the class dispersed, and Mr. Bopp was wrestling<lb>
with a vicious pin as he put on his collar (&ldquo;a sure sign<lb>
he has no ma to see to his buttons, poor lamb!&rdquo; thought<lb>
Mrs. Fairbairn, watching him from afar); when the<lb>
sprightly young lady, accompanied by a lad the masculine<lb>
image of herself, appeared upon the platform, saying,<lb>
with an aspect as cordial as her words, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, sir. Allow me to introduce my<lb>
brother and myself, Dick and Dolly Ward, and ask you,<lb>
in my mother's name, to come home with us; for the<lb>
tavern is not a cosy place, and after all this exertion you<lb>
should be made comfortable. Please come, for Dr. Turner<lb>
always stayed with us, and we promised to do the<lb>
honors of the town to any gentleman he might send to<lb>
supply his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we did; and mother is probably freezing<lb>
<pb n="105">

</eaffig>
her blessed nose off watching for us; so don't disappoint<lb>
her, Bopp. It's all settled; the sleigh's at the door, and<lb>
here's your coat; so, come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was a fine sample of young America in its best<lb>
aspect, and would have said &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; to Louis<lb>
Napoleon if he had been at hand, and have done it so<lb>
heartily that the great Frenchman would have found it<lb>
hard to resist giving as frank an answer. Therefore, no<lb>
wonder that Mr. Bopp surrendered at once; for the<lb>
young gentleman took possession of him bodily, and shook<lb>
him into his coat with an amiable impetuosity which<lb>
developed a sudden rent in the well-worn sleeve thereof,<lb>
and caused an expression of dismay to dawn upon the<lb>
owner's countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon; never mind; mother'll sew you up in<lb>
two seconds, and your overcoat will hide the damage.<lb>
Where is it? I'll get it, and then we'll be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp colored distressfully, looked up, looked down,<lb>
and then straight into the lad's face, saying simply, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; I haf no coat but one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick opened his eyes, and was about opening his mouth<lb>
also, for the exit of some blunderingly good-natured<lb>
reply, when a warning poke from his sister restrained<lb>
him; while Dolly, with the innocent hypocrisy which is as<lb>
natural to some women as the art of tying bows, said, as<lb>
she led the way out, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the worth of gymnastics, Dick, in this<lb>
delightful indifference to cold. I sincerely hope we may<lb>
reach a like enviable state of health, and look upon greatcoats<lb>
as effeminate, and mufflers a weakness of the flesh.<lb>
Do you think we shall, Mr. Bopp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head with a perceptible shiver as the keen<lb>
<pb n="106">

<figdesc>Page 106.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
north wind smote him in the face, but answered, with a<lb>
look half merry, half sad, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not choice, but what you call necessitee, with<lb>
me; and I truly hope you may never haf to exercise to<lb>
keep life in you when you haf sold your coat to pay your<lb>
doctor's bill, or teach the art of laughing while your<lb>
heart is heavy as one stone. You would not like that, I<lb>
think, yet it is good, too; for small things make much<lb>
happiness for me, and a kind word is often better than a<lb>
rix-dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in the young man's tone and<lb>
manner which touched and won his hearers at once.<lb>
Dolly secretly resolved to put an extra blanket on his bed,<lb>
and shower kind words upon him, while Dick tucked him<lb>
up in buffalo robes, where he sat helplessly beaming down<lb>
upon the red hood at his side.</p>
<p>A roaring fire shone out hospitably as they came, and<lb>
glorified the pleasant room, dancing on ancient furniture<lb>
and pictured walls till the jolly old portraits seemed to<lb>
wink a visible welcome. A cheery-faced little woman,<lb>
like an elder Dolly, in a widow's cap, stood on the<lb>
threshold, with a friendly greeting for the stranger, which<lb>
warmed him as no fire could have done.</p>
<p>If August Bopp had been an Englishman, he would<lb>
have felt much, but said less on that account; if he had<lb>
been an American, he would have tried to conceal his<lb>
poverty, and impress the family with his past grandeur,<lb>
present importance, or future prospects; being a German,<lb>
he showed exactly what he was, with the childlike frankness<lb>
of his race. Having had no dinner, he ate heartily<lb>
of what was offered him; being cold, he basked in the<lb>
generous warmth; being homesick and solitary, he<lb>
<pb n="107">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-122">

<figdesc>Page 107.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enjoyed the genial influences that surrounded him, and<lb>
told his story, sure of sympathy; for even in prosaic<lb>
Yankeedom he had found it, as travellers find Alpine<lb>
flowers among the snow.</p>
<p>It was a simple story of a laborious boyhood, being<lb>
early left an orphan, with a little sister dependent on him,<lb>
till an opening in America tempted him to leave her, and<lb>
come to try and earn a home for her and for himself.<lb>
Sickness, misfortune, and disappointment had been his<lb>
companions for a year; but he still worked, still hoped,<lb>
and waited for the happy hour when little Ulla should<lb>
come to him across the sea. This was all; yet as he<lb>
told it, with the magical accompaniments of gesture,<lb>
look, and tone, it seemed full of pathos and romance to<lb>
his listeners, whose faces proved their interest more flatteringly<lb>
than their words.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ward mended the torn coat with motherly zeal,<lb>
and gave it many of those timely stitches which thrifty<lb>
women love to sew. The young folks devoted themselves<lb>
to their guest, each in a characteristic manner. Dick, as<lb>
host, offered every article of refreshment the house<lb>
afforded, goaded the fire to a perpetual roar, and discussed<lb>
gymnastics, with bursts of boyish admiration for the<lb>
grace and skill of his new leader, whom he christened<lb>
King of Clubs on the spot. Dolly made the stranger one<lb>
of them at once by talking bad German, as an offset to<lb>
his bad English, and unconsciously symbolized his future<lb>
bondage by giving him a tangled skein to hold for the<lb>
furtherance of her mother's somewhat lengthened job.</p>
<p>The Cupid of the present day was undoubtedly &ldquo;raised&rdquo;<lb>
in Connecticut; for the ingenuity and shrewdness of that<lb>
small personage could have sprung from no other soil. In<lb>

former times his stratagems were of the romantic order.<lb>
Colin bleated forth his passion in rhyme, and cast sheep's<lb>
eyes from among his flock, while Phyllis coquetted with<lb>
her crook and stuck posies in his hat; royal Ferdinand<lb>
and Miranda played at chess; Ivanhoe upset his fellowmen<lb>
like nine-pins for love of lackadaisical Rowena; and<lb>
&ldquo;sweet Moll&rdquo; turned the pages while her lover, Milton,<lb>
sang. But in our day, the jolly little god, though still a<lb>
heathen in the severe simplicity of his attire, has become<lb>
modernized in his arts, and invented huskings, apple-bees,<lb>
sleigh-rides, &ldquo;dropins,&rdquo; gymnastics, and, among his finer<lb>
snares, the putting on of skates, drawing of patterns, and<lb>
holding skeins, &mdash; the last-named having superior advantages<lb>
over the others, as all will testify who have enjoyed<lb>
one of those hand-to-hand skirmishes.</p>
<p>August Bopp was three-and-twenty, imaginative, grateful<lb>
and heart-whole; therefore, when he found himself<lb>
sitting opposite a blooming little damsel, with a head<lb>
bound by a pretty red snood bent down before him, and<lb>
very close to his own a pair of distracting hands, every<lb>
finger of which had a hit to make, and made it, it is not<lb>
to be denied that he felt himself entering upon a new and<lb>
very agreeable experience. Where could he look but in<lb>
the face opposite, sometimes so girlishly merry and sometimes<lb>
so beautifully shy? It was a winning face, full of<lb>
smooth curves, fresh colors, and sunshiny twinkles, &mdash; a<lb>
face every one liked, for it was as changeful as an April<lb>
day, and always pleasant, whether mischievous, mournful<lb>
or demure.</p>
<p>Like one watching a new picture, Mr. Bopp inspected<lb>
every feature of the countenance so near his own; and<lb>
as his admiration &ldquo;grew by what it fed on,&rdquo; he fell into<lb>

a chronic state of stammer and blush; for the frank eyes<lb>
were very kind, the smooth cheeks reflected a pretty<lb>
shade of his own crimson, and the smiling lips seemed<lb>
constantly suggesting, with mute eloquence, that they<lb>
were made for kissing, while the expressive hands picked<lb>
at the knots till August felt like a very resigned fly in<lb>
the web of a most enticing young spider.</p>
<p>If the King of Clubs saw a comely face, the Queen of<lb>
Hearts saw what observing girls call a &ldquo;good face&rdquo;;<lb>
and with a womanly respect for strength, the manliest<lb>
attribute of man, she admired the broad shoulders and<lb>
six feet one of her new master. This face was not handsome,<lb>
for, true to his fatherland, Bopp had an eminent<lb>
nose, a blonde beard, and a crop of &ldquo;bonnie brown hair&rdquo;<lb>
long enough to have been gathered into a ribbon, as in<lb>
the days of Schiller and Jean Paul; but Dolly liked it,<lb>
for its strength was tempered with gentleness; patience<lb>
and courage gave it dignity, and the glance that met her<lb>
own was both keen and kind.</p>
<p>The silk was wound at last, &mdash; the coat repaired. Dick<lb>
with difficulty concealed the growing stiffness of his<lb>
shoulders, while Dolly turned up the lamp, which bluntly<lb>
hinted bedtime, and Mrs. Ward successfully devoured<lb>
six gapes behind her hand, but was detected in the<lb>
seventh by Mr. Bopp, who glanced at the clock, stopped<lb>
in the middle of a sentence, and, with a hurried &ldquo;gootnight,&rdquo;<lb>
made for the door without the least idea whither<lb>
he was going. Piloted by Dick, he was installed in the<lb>
&ldquo;best chamber,&rdquo; where his waking dreams were enlivened<lb>
by a great fire, and his sleeping ones by an endless<lb>
succession of skeins, each rapturously concluded in the<lb>
style of Sam Weller when folding carpets with the pretty<lb>
maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">I tell</hi> you, Dolly, it won't do, and I'm not going to<lb>
have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed; and how will you help it, you absurd<lb>
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you don't stop it, I'll just say to Bopp, &mdash;<lb>
`Look here, my dear fellow; this sister of mine is a<lb>
capital girl, but she will flirt, and' &mdash; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Add it's a family failing, Dick,&rdquo; cut in Dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. I shall say, `Take care of your<lb>
heart, Bopp, for she has a bad habit of playing battledore<lb>
and shuttlecock with these articles; and, though it<lb>
may be very good fun for a time, it makes them ache when<lb>
they get a last knock and are left to lie in a corner.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;What eloquence! But you'd never dare to try it on<lb>
Mr. Bopp; and I shouldn't like to predict what would<lb>
happen to you if you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say `dare,' I'll do it the first minute I see<lb>
him. As for consequences, I don't care that for 'em;&rdquo;<lb>
and Dick snapped his fingers with an aspect of much<lb>
disdain. But something in his sister's face suggested the<lb>
wisdom of moderation, and moved him to say, less like a<lb>
lord of creation, and more like a brother who privately<lb>
adored his sister, but of course was not going to acknowledge<lb>
such a weakness, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but soberly, now, I wish you wouldn't plague<lb>
Bopp; for it's evident to me that he is hit; and from the<lb>
way you've gone on these two months, what else was to<lb>
be expected? Now, as the head of the family, &mdash; you<lb>
needn't laugh, for I am, &mdash; I think I ought to interfere;<lb>
and so I put it to you, &mdash; do you like him, and will you<lb>
have him? or are you merely amusing yourself, as you<lb>

</eaffig>
have done ever since you were out of pinafores? If you<lb>
like him, all serene. I'd rather have him for a brother<lb>
than any one I know, for he's a regular trump, though he<lb>
<hi rend="italics">is</hi> poor; but if you don't, I won't have the dear old fellow<lb>
floored just because you like to see it done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may here be remarked that Dolly quite glowed to hear<lb>
her brother praise Mr. Bopp, and that she endorsed every<lb>
word with mental additions of double warmth; but Dick<lb>
had begun all wrong, and, manlike, demanded her confidence<lb>
before she had made up her mind to own she had<lb>
any to bestow; therefore nothing came of it but vexation<lb>
of spirit; for it is a well-known fact that, on some<lb>
subjects, if boys <hi rend="italics">will</hi> tease girls <hi rend="italics">will</hi> fib, and both maintain<lb>
that it is right. So Dolly whetted her feminine<lb>
weapon, and assumed a lofty superiority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! what a sudden spasm of virtue; and why,<lb>
if it is such a sin, has not the `head of the house' taken<lb>
his sister to task before, instead of indulging in a like<lb>
degeneracy, and causing several interesting persons to<lb>
tear their hair, and bewail his forgetfulness, when they<lb>
ought to have blessed their stars he was out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick snow-balled a dozing crow and looked nettled; for<lb>
he had attained that age when &ldquo;Tom Brown at Oxford&rdquo;<lb>
was the book of books, the twelfth chapter being the<lb>
favorite, and five young ladies having already been<lb>
endowed with the significant heliotrope flower, &mdash; all of<lb>
which facts Dolly had skilfully brought to mind, as a<lb>
return-shot for his somewhat personal remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! they were only girls, and it don't amount to<lb>
anything among us young folks; but Bopp is a grown<lb>
man, and you ought to respect him too much to play<lb>
such pranks with him. Besides, he's a German, and<lb>

more tender-hearted than we rough Yankees, as any one<lb>
can see by the way he acts when you snub him. He is<lb>
proud, too, for all his meekness, and waits till he's sure<lb>
you like him before he says anything; and he'll need the<lb>
patience of a family of Jobs at the rate you're going on,&mdash;<lb>
a honey-pot one day and a pickle-jar the next. Do<lb>
make up your mind, and say yes or no, right off, Dolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have me meet him at the door with a<lb>
meck courtesy, and say, `Oh, if you please, I'm ready to<lb>
say, Yes, thank you, if you'll be good enough to say,<lb>
Will you'?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be a goose, child; you know I mean nothing<lb>
of the kind; only you girls never will do anything<lb>
straight ahead if you can dodge and fuss and make a<lb>
mess of it. Just tell me one thing: Do you, or don't<lb>
you, like old Bopp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an elegant way to put it! Of course I like<lb>
him well enough as a leader; he is clever, and sort of<lb>
cunning, and I enjoy his funny ways; but what in the<lb>
world should I do with a great yellow-haired laddie who<lb>
could put me in his pocket, and yet is so meek that I<lb>
should never find the heart to hen-peck him? You are<lb>
welcome to him; and since you love him so much, there's<lb>
no need of my troubling myself on his account; for with<lb>
you for a friend, he can have no earthly wish ungratified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't try to be cutting, Dolly, because you look<lb>
homely when you do, and it's a woman's business to be<lb>
pretty always. All I've got to say is, you will be<lb>
in a nice state of mind if you damage Bopp; for every<lb>
one likes him, and will be down upon you for a heartless<lb>
little wretch; and I shan't blame them, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the town wouldn't put its fingers in other<lb>

people's pies, and you may tell it so, with my compliments;<lb>
and all <hi rend="italics">I</hi> have to say is, that you men have more<lb>
liberty than you know what to do with, and we women<lb>
haven't enough; so it's perfectly fair that we should show<lb>
you the worth of the thing by taking it away now and<lb>
then. I shall do exactly as I please: dance, walk, ride<lb>
and flirt, whenever and with whomever I see fit; and the<lb>
whole town, with Mr. Dick Ward at their head, can't<lb>
stop me if I choose to go on. Now then, what next?&rdquo;<lb>
After which declaration of independence Dolly folded<lb>
her arms and wheeled about and faced her brother, a spirited<lb>
statuette of Self-Will, in a red hood and mittens.</p>
<p>Dick sternly asked, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your firm decision, ma'am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will not give up your nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure you don't care for Bopp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could slap him with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. I shall see that you don't get a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't try a skirmish, for you'll get beaten,<lb>
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll prove that, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the belligerents loftily paced up the lawn, with<lb>
their purpose so well expressed by outward signs that<lb>
Mrs. Ward knew, by the cock of Dick's hat and the<lb>
decided tap of Dolly's heels, that a storm was brewing,<lb>
before they entered the door.</p>
<p>This fraternal conversation took place some two<lb>
months from the evening of Mr. Bopp's advent, as the<lb>
young folks were strolling home from school, which school<lb>
<pb n="114">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-131">

<figdesc>Page 114.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
must be briefly alluded to in order to explain the foregoing<lb>
remarks. It was an excellent institution in all<lb>
respects; for its presiding genius stood high in the townfolks'<lb>
esteem, and might have served as an example to<lb>
Dr. Watts' &ldquo;busy bee,&rdquo; in the zeal with which he improved<lb>
his &ldquo;shining hours,&rdquo; and laid up honey against<lb>
the winter, which many hoped would be long in coming.<lb>
All manner of aids were provided for sprouting souls and<lb>
bodies, diversions innumerable, and the best society. But,<lb>
sad to relate, in spite of all these blessings, the students<lb>
who resorted to this academy possessed an Adam-and-Eve-like<lb>
proclivity for exactly what they hadn't got and<lb>
didn't need; and, not contented with the pleasures provided,<lb>
must needs play truant with that young scamp<lb>
Eros, and turn the ancient town topsy-turvy with modern<lb>
innovations, till scandalized spinsters predicted that the<lb>
very babies would catch the fever, refuse their panada in<lb>
jealous gloom, send billets-doux in their rattles, elope in<lb>
wicker-carriages, and set up housekeeping in dolls' houses,<lb>
after the latest fashion.</p>
<p>Certain inflammable Southerners introduced the new<lb>
game, and left such romantic legends of their loves behind<lb>
them that their successors were fired with an ambition to<lb>
do the like, and excel in all things, from cricket to<lb>
captivation.</p>
<p>This state of things is not to be wondered at; for<lb>
America, being renowned as a &ldquo;fast&rdquo; nation, has become<lb>
a sort of hot-bed, and seems to force humanity into early<lb>
bloom. Therefore, past generations must not groan over<lb>
the sprightly present, but sit in the chimney-corner and<lb>
see boys and girls play the game which is too apt to end<lb>
in a checkmate for one of the players. To many of the<lb>
<pb n="115">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-132">

<figdesc>Page 115.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
lookers-on, the new order of things was as good as a<lb>
puppet-show; for, with the enthusiasm of youth, the<lb>
actors performed their parts heartily, forgetting the audience<lb>
in their own earnestness. Bless us! what revolutions<lb>
went on under the round jackets, and what<lb>
love-tokens lay in the pockets thereof. What plots and<lb>
counterplots occupied the heads that wore the innocentlooking<lb>
snoods, and what captives were taken in the<lb>
many-colored nets that would come off and have to be<lb>
taken care of. What romances blossomed like dandelions<lb>
along the road to school, and what tales the river might<lb>
have told if any one could have learned its musical<lb>
speech. How certain gates were glorified by daily lingerings<lb>
thereat, and what tender memories hung about<lb>
dingy desks, old pens, and books illustrated with all manner<lb>
of symbolical designs.</p>
<p>Let those laugh who will: older and wiser men and<lb>
women might have taken lessons of these budding heroes<lb>
and heroines; for here all was honest, sincere, and fresh;<lb>
the old world had not taught them falsehood, self-interest,<lb>
or mean ambitions. When they lost or won, they frankly<lb>
grieved or rejoiced, and wore no masks except in play,<lb>
and then got them off as soon as possible. If blue-eyed<lb>
Lizzie frowned, or went home with Joe, Ned, with a wisdom<lb>
older lovers would do well to imitate, went in for<lb>
another game of foot-ball, gave the rejected apple to little<lb>
Sally, and whistled &ldquo;Glory Hallelujah&rdquo; instead of<lb>
&ldquo;Annie Laurie,&rdquo; which was better than blowing a rival's<lb>
brains out, or glowering at womankind forever after.<lb>
Or, when Tom put on Clara's skates three successive<lb>
days, and danced with her three successive evenings,<lb>
leaving Kitty to freeze her feet in the one instance and<lb>
<pb n="116">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-133">

<figdesc>Page 116.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fold her hands in the other, she just had a &ldquo;good cry,&rdquo;<lb>
gave her mother an extra kiss, and waited till the recreant<lb>
Tom returned to his allegiance, finding his little friend a<lb>
sweetheart in nature as in name.</p>
<p>Dick and Dolly were foremost in the ranks, and expert<lb>
in all the new amusements. Dick worshipped at many<lb>
shrines, but most faithfully at that of a meek divinity,<lb>
who returned charming answers to the ardent epistles<lb>
which he left in her father's garden wall, where, Pyramus<lb>
and Thisbe-like, they often chatted through a chink; and<lb>
Dolly was seldom seen without a staff of aids who would<lb>
have &ldquo;fought, bled, and died&rdquo; for her as cheerfully as<lb>
the Little Corporal's Old Guard, though she paid them<lb>
only in words; for her Waterloo had not yet come.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">With</hi> the charming perversity of her sex in such<lb>
matters, no sooner had Dolly declared that she didn't<lb>
like Mr. Bopp, than she began to discover that she did;<lb>
and so far from desiring &ldquo;to slap him,&rdquo; a tendency to<lb>
regard him with peculiar good-will and tenderness developed<lb>
itself, much to her own surprise; for with all her<lb>
coquetry and seeming coldness, Dolly had a right<lb>
womanly heart of her own, though she had never<lb>
acknowledged the fact till August Bopp looked at her<lb>
with so much love and longing in his honest eyes.<lb>
Then she found a little fear mingling with her regard,<lb>
felt a strong desire to be respected by him, discovered a<lb>
certain something which she called conscience, restraining<lb>
a reckless use of her power, and, soon after her lofty<lb>
denial to Dick, was forced to own that Mr. Bopp had<lb>
<pb n="117">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-134">

<figdesc>Page 117.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
become her master in the finer species of gymnastics<lb>
that came in with Adam and Eve, and have kept all<lb>
creation turning somersets ever since. Of course these<lb>
discoveries were unconfessed, even to that best bosom<lb>
friend which any of us can have; yet her mother suspected<lb>
them, and, with much anxiety, saw all, yet held<lb>
her peace, knowing that her little daughter would, sooner<lb>
or later, give her a fuller confidence than could be demanded;<lb>
and remembering the happiest moments of her<lb>
own happy past, when an older Dick wooed another<lb>
Dolly, she left that flower, which never can be forced, to<lb>
open at its own sweet will.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bopp, though carrying his heart upon<lb>
his sleeve, believed his secret buried in the deepest gloom,<lb>
and enjoyed all the delightful miseries lovers insist upon<lb>
making for themselves. When Dolly was quiet or absent,<lb>
he became pensive, the lesson dragged, and people fancied<lb>
they were getting tired of the humbug; when Dolly<lb>
was blithe and bland, he grew radiant, exercised within<lb>
an inch of his life as a vent for his emotions, and people<lb>
went home declaring gymnastics to be the crowning triumph<lb>
of the age; and when Dolly was capricious, Mr.<lb>
Bopp became a bewildered weathercock, changing as the<lb>
wind changed, and dire was the confusion occasioned<lb>
thereby.</p>
<p>Like the sage fowl in the story, Dick said nothing, but<lb>
&ldquo;kept up a terrible thinking,&rdquo; and, not having had experience<lb>
enough to know that when a woman says No she<lb>
is very apt to mean Yes, he took Dolly at her word.<lb>
Believing it to be his duty to warn &ldquo;Old Bopp,&rdquo; he<lb>
resolved to do it like a Roman brother, regardless of his<lb>
own feelings or his sister's wrath, quite unconscious that<lb>
<pb n="118">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-135">

<figdesc>Page 118.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the motive-power in the affair was a boyish love of ruling<lb>
the young person who ruled every one else.</p>
<p>Matters stood thus, when the town was electrified by<lb>
a general invitation to the annual jubilee at Jollyboys<lb>
Hall, which this spring flowered into a masquerade, and<lb>
filled the souls of old and young with visions of splendor,<lb>
frolic and fun. Being an amiable old town, it gave<lb>
itself up, like a kind grandma, to the wishes of its children,<lb>
let them put its knitting away, disturb its naps, keep<lb>
its hands busy with vanities of the flesh, and its mind in a<lb>
state of chaos for three mortal weeks. Young ladies were<lb>
obscured by tarlatan fogs, behind which they concocted<lb>
angels' wings, newspaper gowns, Minnehaha's wampum,<lb>
and Cinderella's slippers. Inspired but incapable boys<lb>
undertook designs that would have daunted a costumer<lb>
of the first water, fell into sloughs of despond, and,<lb>
emerging, settled down from peers and paladins into<lb>
jovial tars, friar waterproofs, and officers in miscellaneous<lb>
uniforms. Fathers laughed or grumbled at the whole<lb>
thing, and advanced pecuniary loans with good or ill<lb>
grace, as the case might be; but the mothers, whose<lb>
interest in their children's pleasure is a sort of evergreen<lb>
that no snows of time can kill, sewed spangles by the<lb>
bushel, made wildernesses of tissue-paper blossom as the<lb>
rose, kept tempers sweet, stomachs full, and domestic<lb>
machinery working smoothly through it all, by that maternal<lb>
magic which makes them the human providences<lb>
of this naughty world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I go as?&rdquo; was the universal cry. Garrets<lb>
were taken by storm, cherished relics were teased out of<lb>
old ladies' lavendered chests (happy she who saw them<lb>
again!), hats were made into boots, gowns into doublets,<lb>
<pb n="119">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-136">

<figdesc>Page 119.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
cloaks into hose, Sunday bonnets despoiled of their<lb>
plumage, silken cauliflowers sown broadcast over the<lb>
land, and cocked-up caps erected in every style of architecture,<lb>
while &ldquo;Tag, Rag, and Bobtail&rdquo; drove a smashing<lb>
business, and everybody knew what everybody else<lb>
was going to be, and solemnly vowed they didn't, &mdash;<lb>
which transparent falsehood was the best joke of the<lb>
whole.</p>
<p>Dolly allowed her mates to believe she was to be the<lb>
Queen of Hearts, but privately laid hold of certain<lb>
brocades worn by a trim grandmother half a century<lb>
ago, and one evening burst upon her brother in a charming<lb>
&ldquo;Little Bo-Peep&rdquo; costume, which, for the benefit of<lb>
future distressed damsels, may be described as a white<lb>
silk skirt, scarlet overdress, &ldquo;neatly bundled up behind,&rdquo;<lb>
as ancient ladies expressed it, blue hose with red clocks,<lb>
high-heeled shoes with silver buckles, a nosegay in the<lb>
tucker, and a fly-way hat perched on the top of black<lb>
curls, which gave additional archness to Dolly's face as<lb>
she entered, singing that famous ditty.</p>
<p>Dick surveyed her with approval, turning her about<lb>
like a lay figure, and expressing his fraternal opinion<lb>
that she was &ldquo;the sauciest little turnout he ever saw,&rdquo;<lb>
and then wet-blanketed the remark by adding, &ldquo;Of<lb>
course you don't call it a disguise, do you? and don't<lb>
flatter yourself that you won't be known; for Dolly<lb>
Ward is as plainly written in every curl, bow, and<lb>
gimcrack, as if you wore a label on your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shan't wear it&rdquo;; and off went the hat at one<lb>
fell blow, as Dolly threw her crook in one corner, her<lb>
posy in another, and sat down an image of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don't be a goose, and rip everything to bits;<lb>
<pb n="120">

just wear a domino over all, as Fan is going to, and<lb>
then, when you've had fun enough, take it off and do the<lb>
pretty. It will make two rigs, you see, and bother the<lb>
boys to your heart's content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, I insist upon kissing you for that brilliant suggestion;<lb>
and then you may run and get me eight yards<lb>
of cambric, just the color of Fan's; but if you tell any<lb>
one, I'll keep her from dancing with you the whole<lb>
evening;&rdquo; with which bribe and threat Dolly embraced<lb>
her brother, and shut the door in his face, while he,<lb>
putting himself in good humor by imagining she was<lb>
somebody else, departed on his muddy mission.</p>
<p>If the ghosts of the first settlers had taken their walks<lb>
abroad on the eventful Friday night, they would have<lb>
held up their shadowy hands at the scenes going on under<lb>
their venerable noses; for strange figures flitted through<lb>
the quiet streets, and, instead of decorous slumber, there<lb>
was decidedly &mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;A sound of revelry by night.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>Spurs clanked and swords rattled over the frosty<lb>
ground, as if the British were about to make another<lb>
flying call; hooded monks and nuns paced along, on<lb>
carnal thoughts intent; ancient ladies and bewigged<lb>
gentlemen seemed hurrying to enjoy a social cup of tea,<lb>
and groan over the tax; barrels staggered and stuck<lb>
through narrow ways, as if temperance were still among<lb>
the lost arts, while bears, apes, imps and elves pattered<lb>
or sparkled by, as if a second Walpurgis Night had<lb>
come, and all were bound for Blocksberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray for the rooster!&rdquo; shouted Young Ireland,<lb>
encamped on the sidewalk to see the show, as<lb>

Mephistopheles' red cock's feather skimmed up the stairs, and<lb>
he left a pink domino at the ladies' dressing-room door,<lb>
with the brief warning, &ldquo;Now cut your own capers and<lb>
leave me to mine,&rdquo; adding, as he paused a moment at<lb>
the great door, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! isn't it a jolly sight, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was; for a mammoth boot stood sentinel at<lb>
the entrance; a Bedouin Arab leaned on his spear in one<lb>
corner, looking as if ready to say, &mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;Fly to the desert, fly with me,&rdquo;</p></q>
to the pretty Jewess on his arm; a stately Hamlet, with<lb>
irreproachable legs, settled his plumage in another, still<lb>
undecided to which Ophelia he would first address &mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;The honey of his music vows.&rdquo;</p></q>
Bluff King Hal's representative was waltzing in a way<lb>
that would have filled that stout potentate with respectful<lb>
admiration, while Queen Katherine flirted with a Fire<lb>
Zouave. Alcibiades whisked Mother Goose about the<lb>
room till the old lady's conical hat tottered on her head,<lb>
and the Union held fast to a very little Mac. Flocks of<lb>
friars, black, white and gray, pervaded the hall, with<lb>
flocks of ballet-girls, intended to represent peasants, but<lb>
failing for lack of drapery; morning and evening stars<lb>
rose or set, as partners willed; lively red demons<lb>
harassed meek nuns, and knights of the Leopard, the<lb>
Lion, or Griffin, flashed by, looking heroically uncomfortable<lb>
in their gilded cages; court ladies promenaded<lb>
with Jack-tars, and dukes danced with dairy-maids, while<lb>
Brother Jonathan whittled, Aunt Dinah jabbered,<lb>

Ingomar flourished his club, and every one felt warmly enthusiastic<lb>
and vigorously jolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach himmel! Das ist wunder sch&ouml;n!&rdquo; murmured a<lb>
tall, gray monk, looking in, and quite unconscious that<lb>
he spoke aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Bopp! I thought you weren't coming,&rdquo; cried<lb>
Mephistopheles in an emphatic whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I guess you! yes, you are well done. I should<lb>
like to be a Faust for you, but I haf no time, no purse<lb>
for a dress, so I throw this on, and run up for a hour<lb>
or two. Where is, &mdash; who is all these people? Do you<lb>
know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one with the Pope, Fra Diavolo, the telegraph,<lb>
and two knights asking her to dance, is Dolly, if that's<lb>
what you want to know. Go in and keep it up, Bopp,<lb>
while you can; I am off for Fan;&rdquo; and Mephistopheles<lb>
departed over the banisters with a weird agility that delighted<lb>
the beholders; while the gray friar stole into a<lb>
corner and watched the pink domino for half an hour, at<lb>
the end of which time his regards were somewhat confused<lb>
by discovering that there were two pink damsels so<lb>
like that he could not tell which was the one pointed out<lb>
by Dick, and which the new-comer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks I will not know her, but I shall go now<lb>
and find out for myself;&rdquo; and, starting into sudden activity,<lb>
the gray brother strode up to the nearest pink<lb>
lady, bowed, and offered his arm. With a haughty little<lb>
gesture of denial to several others, she accepted it, and<lb>
they joined the circle of many-colored promenaders that<lb>
eddied round the hall. As they went, Mr. Bopp scrutinized<lb>
his companion, but saw only a slender figure<lb>
<pb n="123">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-140">

<figdesc>Page 123.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
shrouded from head to foot, and the tip of a white glove<lb>
resting on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will speak; then her voice will betray her,&rdquo; he<lb>
thought, forgetting that his own was undisguisable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, permit me that I fan you, it is so greatly<lb>
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fan was surrendered with a bow, and the masked<lb>
face turned fully towards his own, while the hood trembled<lb>
as if its wearer laughed silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is you, &mdash; I know the eyes, the step, the<lb>
laugh. Miss Dolly, did you think you could hide from<lb>
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not wish to,&rdquo; was the whispered answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think I would come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are not displease with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am very glad; I wanted you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pink head drooped a little nearer, and another<lb>
white glove went to meet its mate upon his arm with a<lb>
pretty, confiding gesture. Mr. Bopp instantly fell into a<lb>
state of bliss, &mdash; the lights, music, gay surroundings,<lb>
and, more than all, this unwonted demonstration, put the<lb>
crowning glory to the moment; and, fired with the hopeful<lb>
omen, he allowed his love to silence his prudence, and<lb>
lead him to do, then and there, the very thing he had<lb>
often resolved never to do at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss Dolly, if you knew how much, how very<lb>
much you haf enlarged my happiness, and made this<lb>
efening shine for me, you would more often be a little<lb>
friendly, for this winter has been all summer to me,<lb>
since I knew you and your kind home, and now I haf no<lb>
sorrow but that after the next lesson I come no more<lb>
<pb n="124">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-141">

<figdesc>Page 124.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
unless you gif me leaf. See now I must say this even<lb>
here, when so much people are about us, because I cannot<lb>
stop it; and you will forgif me that I cannot wait<lb>
any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bopp, please don't, please stop!&rdquo; began the<lb>
pink domino in a hurried whisper. But Mr. Bopp was<lb>
not to be stopped. He had dammed up the stream so<lb>
long, that now it rushed on fast, full and uncontrollable;<lb>
for, leading her into one of the curtained recesses near<lb>
by, he sat down beside her, and, still plying the fan,<lb>
went on impetuously, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel to say that I lofe you, and tho' I try to kill it,<lb>
my lofe will not die, because it is more strong than my<lb>
will, more dear than my pride, for I haf much, and I do<lb>
not ask you to be meine Frau till I can gif you more<lb>
than my heart and my poor name. But hear now: I<lb>
will work, and save, and wait a many years if at the end<lb>
you will take all I haf and say, `August, I lofe you.'<lb>
Do not laugh at me because I say this in such poor<lb>
words; you are my heart's dearest, and I must tell it or<lb>
never come again. Speak to me one kind yes, and I will<lb>
thank Gott for so much joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pink domino had listened to this rapid speech<lb>
with averted head, and, when it ended, started up, saying<lb>
eagerly, &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir, I am not Dolly;&rdquo; but<lb>
as she spoke her words were belied, for the hasty movement<lb>
partially displaced her mask, and Mr. Bopp saw<lb>
Dolly's eyes, a lock of dark hair, and a pair of burning<lb>
cheeks, before the screen was readjusted. With redoubled<lb>
earnestness he held her back, whispering, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go mitout the little word, Yes, or No; it is<lb>
not much to say.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="125">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-142">

<figdesc>Page 125.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it? Dolly! truly mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let me go at once, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp stood up, saying, slowly, &mdash; &ldquo;Yes, go now;<lb>
they told me you had no heart; I beliefe it, and thank<lb>
you for that No;&rdquo; then bowed, and walked straight out<lb>
of the hall, while the pink domino broke into a fit of<lb>
laughter, saying to herself, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've done it! I've done it! but what a piece of work<lb>
there'll be to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, who was that tall creature Fan was parading<lb>
with last night? No one knew, and he vanished before<lb>
the masks were taken off,&rdquo; asked Dolly, as she and her<lb>
brother lounged in opposite corners of the sofa the<lb>
morning after the masquerade, &ldquo;talking it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was old Bopp, Mrs. Peep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me! why, he said he wasn't coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People sometimes say what they don't mean, as you<lb>
may have discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn't he come and speak to a body,<lb>
Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better employed, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don't be cross, dear, but tell me all about it,<lb>
for I don't understand how you allowed him to monopolize<lb>
Fan so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't bother, I'm sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you're not; you look wicked; I know you've<lb>
been in mischief, and I insist upon hearing all about it,<lb>
so come and tell this instant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dolly proceeded to enforce her command by pulling<lb>
away his pillow and dragging her brother into a sitting<lb>
posture, in spite of his laughing resistance and evident<lb>
desire to exhaust her patience; for Dick excelled in teasing,<lb>
and kept his sister in a fidget from morning till<lb>
night, with occasional fits of penitence and petting which<lb>
lasted till next time. Therefore, though dying to tell, he<lb>
was undecided as to the best method of executing that<lb>
task in the manner most aggravating to his listener and<lb>
most agreeable to himself, and sat regarding her with<lb>
twinkling eyes, and his curly pate in a high state of<lb>
rumple, trying to appear innocently meek, but failing<lb>
signally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, begin,&rdquo; commanded Dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won't take my head off till I'm done,<lb>
I'll tell you the best joke of the season. Are you sure<lb>
the pink domino with Bopp wasn't yourself, &mdash; for she<lb>
looked and acted very like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I didn't even know he was there,<lb>
and think it very rude and ungentlemanly in him not to<lb>
come and speak to me. You know it was Fan, so do go<lb>
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn't, for she changed her mind and wore a<lb>
black domino; I saw her put it on myself. Her Cousin<lb>
Jack came unexpectedly, and she thought if she altered<lb>
her dress and went with him, you wouldn't know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could it have been, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's the mystery, for, do you know, Bopp proposed<lb>
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn't!&rdquo; and Dolly flew up with a startled look<lb>
that, to adopt a phrase from his own vocabulary, was<lb>
&ldquo;nuts&rdquo; to her brother.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes he did; I heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, where, and how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of those flirtation boxes; they dropped the<lb>
curtain, but I heard him do it, on my honor I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persons of honor don't listen at curtains and keyholes.<lb>
What did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it wasn't honorable to listen, it isn't to hear;<lb>
so I won't tell, though I could not help knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy! don't stop now, or I shall die with curiosity.<lb>
I dare say I should have done the same; no one minds<lb>
at such a place, you know. But I don't see the joke<lb>
yet,&rdquo; said Dolly dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; and Dick went off into a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You idiotic boy, take that pillow out of your mouth,<lb>
and tell me the whole thing, &mdash; what he said, what she<lb>
said, and what they both did. It was all fun, of course,<lb>
but I'd like to hear about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been fun on her part, but it was solemn<lb>
earnest on his, for he went it strong I assure you. I'd<lb>
no idea the old fellow was so sly, for he appeared<lb>
smashed with you, you know, and there he was finishing<lb>
up with this unknown lady. I wish you could have<lb>
heard him go on, with tears in his eyes &mdash; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know, if you didn't see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that's only a figure of speech; I thought<lb>
so from his voice. He was ever so tender, and took to<lb>
Dutch when English was too cool for him. It was<lb>
really touching, for I never heard a fellow do it before;<lb>
and, upon my word, I should think it was rather a tough<lb>
job to say that sort of thing to a pretty woman, mask or<lb>
no mask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; asked Dolly, with her hands<lb>
<pb n="128">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-145">

<figdesc>Page 128.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
pressed tight together, and a curious little quiver of the<lb>
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said No, as short as pie-crust; and when he<lb>
rushed out with his heart broken all to bits, apparently,<lb>
she just burst out laughing, and went and polked at a<lb>
two-forty pace for half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora unclasped her hands, took a long breath, and<lb>
cried out, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a wicked, heartless hussy! and if I know<lb>
her, I'll never speak to her again; for if he was really<lb>
in earnest, she ought to be killed for laughing at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ought you, then, for making fun of poor Fisher<lb>
when he went down on his knees behind the berry bushes<lb>
last summer. He was earnest enough, for he looked as<lb>
blue as his berries when he got home. Your theory is<lb>
all right, ma'am, but your practice is all bosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue about that silly thing. Boys in<lb>
college think they know everything, can do everything,<lb>
have everything, and only need beckon, and all womankind<lb>
will come and adore. It made a man of him, and<lb>
he'll thank me for taking the sentimental nonsense and<lb>
conceit out of him. You will need just such a lesson at<lb>
the rate you go on, and I hope Fan will give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the lecture is over, I'll go on with the joke, if<lb>
you want to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn't this all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bless you, no! the cream of it is to come.<lb>
What would you give to know who the lady was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars, down, this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, hand 'em over, and I'll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dolly produced her purse, and, bill in hand, sat waiting<lb>
for the disclosure. Dick rose with a melo-dramatic<lb>
bow, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo, it was I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's a great fib, for I saw you flying about the<lb>
whole evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw my dress, but I was not in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! who <hi rend="italics">did</hi> I keep going to, then? and what<lb>
<hi rend="italics">did</hi> I do to make a fool of myself, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Purse and bill dropped out of Dolly's hand, and she<lb>
looked at her brother with a distracted expression of<lb>
countenance. Dick rubbed his hands and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's a jolly state of things! Now I'll tell you the<lb>
whole story. I never thought of doing it till I saw Bopp<lb>
and told him who you were; but on my way for Fan I<lb>
wondered if he'd get puzzled between you two; and then<lb>
a grand idea popped into my head to puzzle him myself,<lb>
for I can take you off to the life. Fan didn't want me<lb>
to, but I made her, so she lent me hoops, and gown, and<lb>
the pink domino, and if ever I thanked my stars I wasn't<lb>
tall, I did then, for the things fitted capitally as to length,<lb>
though I kept splitting something down the back, and scattering<lb>
hooks and eyes in all directions. I wish you<lb>
could have heard Jack roar while they rigged me. He<lb>
had no dress, so I lent him mine, till just before the<lb>
masks were taken off, when we cut home and changed.<lb>
He told me how you kept running to him to tie up your<lb>
slippers, find your fan, and tell him funny things, thinking<lb>
it was me. I never enjoyed anything so much in my<lb>
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Dolly, in a breathless sort of voice, and<lb>
the deluded boy obeyed.</p>
<pb n="130">

<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-147">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew Bopp, and hovered near till he came to find<lb>
out who I was. I took you off in style, and it deceived<lb>
him, for I'm only an inch or two taller than you, and<lb>
kept my head down in the lackadaisical way you girls<lb>
do; I whispered, so my voice didn't betray me; and<lb>
was very clinging, and sweet, and fluttery, and that<lb>
blessed old goose was sure it was you. I thought it was<lb>
all over once, for when he came the heavy in the recess<lb>
I got a bit flustered, he was so serious about it, my<lb>
mask slipped, but I caught it, so he only saw my eyes<lb>
and forehead, which are just like yours, and that finished<lb>
him, for I've no doubt I looked as red and silly as you<lb>
would have done in a like fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say No?&rdquo; and Dolly looked as stern<lb>
as fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I say? You told me you wouldn't<lb>
have him, and I thought it would save you the bother of<lb>
saying it, and him the pain of asking twice. I told him<lb>
some time ago that you were a born flirt; he said he<lb>
knew it; so I was surprised to hear him go on at such a<lb>
rate, but supposed that I was too amiable, and that<lb>
misled him. Poor old Bopp, I kept thinking of him all<lb>
night, as he looked when he said, `They told me you had<lb>
no heart, now I believe it, and I thank you for that No.'<lb>
It was rather a hard joke for him, but it's over now, and<lb>
he won't have to do it again. You said I wouldn't <hi rend="italics">dare</hi><lb>
tell him about you; didn't I? and haven't I won the &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the sentence went spinning dizzily through<lb>
Dick's head, as a sudden tingling sensation pervaded his<lb>
left ear, followed by a similar smart in the right; and,<lb>
for a moment, chaos seemed to have come again. Whatever<lb>
Dolly did was thoroughly done: when she danced,<lb>
<pb n="131">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-148">

<figdesc>Page 131.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the soles of her shoes attested the fact; when she flirted,<lb>
it was warm work while it lasted; and when she was<lb>
angry, it thundered, lightened, and blew great guns till<lb>
the shower came, and the whole affair ended in a rainbow.<lb>
Therefore, being outwitted, disappointed, mortified<lb>
and hurt, her first impulse was to find a vent for<lb>
these conflicting emotions; and possessing skilful hands,<lb>
she left them to avenge the wrong done her heart, which<lb>
they did so faithfully, that if ever a young gentleman's<lb>
ears were vigorously and completely boxed, Dick was<lb>
that young individual. As the thunder-clap ceased, the<lb>
gale began, and blew steadily for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it a joke, do you? I tell you it's a<lb>
wicked, cruel thing; you've told a lie; you've broken<lb>
August's heart, and made me so angry that I'll never<lb>
forgive you as long as I live. What do you know about<lb>
my feelings? and how dare you take it upon yourself to<lb>
answer for me? You think because we are nearly the<lb>
same age that I am no older than you, but you're mistaken,<lb>
for a boy of eighteen <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a boy, a girl of seventeen<lb>
is often a woman, with a woman's hopes and plans; you<lb>
don't understand this any more than you do August's love<lb>
for me, which you listened to and laughed at. I said I<lb>
didn't like him, and I didn't find out till afterward that I<lb>
did; then I was afraid to tell you, lest you'd twit me<lb>
with it. But now I care for no one, and I say I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> like<lb>
him, &mdash; yes, I love him with all my heart, and soul, and<lb>
might, and I'd die this minute if I could undo the harm<lb>
you've done, and see him happy! I know I've been<lb>
selfish, vain, and thoughtless, but I am not now; I hoped<lb>
he'd love me, hoped he'd see I cared for him, that I'd<lb>
done trifling, and didn't mind if he <hi rend="italics">was</hi> poor, for I'd<lb>
<pb n="132">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-149">

<figdesc>Page 132.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enough for both; that I longed to make his life pleasant<lb>
after all his troubles; that I'd send for the little sister he<lb>
loves so well, and never let him suffer any more; for he<lb>
is so good, so patient, so generous, and dear to me, I<lb>
cannot do enough for him. Now it's all spoilt; now I<lb>
can never tell him this, never comfort him in any way,<lb>
never be happy again all my life, and <hi rend="italics">you</hi> have done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dolly stood before her brother, pouring out her<lb>
words with glittering eyes, impetuous voice, and face<lb>
pale with passionate emotion, he was scared; for, as his<lb>
scattered wits returned to him, he felt that he had been<lb>
playing with edge-tools, and had cut and slashed in rather<lb>
a promiscuous manner. Dazed and dizzy, he sat staring<lb>
at the excited figure before him, forgetting the indignity<lb>
he had received, the mistake he had made, the damage<lb>
he had done, in simple wonder at the revolutions going<lb>
on under his astonished eyes. When Dolly stopped for<lb>
breath, he muttered with a contrite look, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm very sorry, &mdash; it was only fun; and I thought it<lb>
would help you both, for how the deuce should I know<lb>
you liked the man when you said you hated him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said that, and if I'd wanted advice I should<lb>
have gone to mother. You men go blundering off with<lb>
half an idea in your heads, and never see your stupidity<lb>
till you have made a mess that can't be mended; we<lb>
women don't work so, but save people's feelings, and are<lb>
called hypocrites for our pains. I never meant to tell<lb>
you, but I will now, to show you how I've been serving<lb>
you, while you've been harming me: every one of those<lb>
notes from Fan which you admire so much, answer so<lb>
carefully, and wear out in your pocket, though copied by<lb>
her, were written by me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="133">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-150">

<figdesc>Page 133.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickins they were!&rdquo; Up flew Dick, and clapping<lb>
his hand on the left-breast pocket, out came a dozen<lb>
pink notes tied up with a blue ribbon, and much the<lb>
worse for wear. He hastily turned them over as Dolly<lb>
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did it, for she didn't know how to answer<lb>
your notes, and came to me. I didn't laugh at them, or<lb>
make fun of her, but helped her silly little wits, and made<lb>
you a happy boy for three months, though you teased me<lb>
day and night, for I loved you, and hadn't the heart to<lb>
spoil your pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've done it now with a vengeance, and you're a<lb>
pair of deceitful minxes. I've paid <hi rend="italics">you</hi> off. I'll give<lb>
Fan one more note that will keep her eyes red for a<lb>
month; and I'll never love or trust a girl again as long<lb>
as I live, &mdash; never! never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red with wrath, Dick threw the treasured packet into<lb>
the fire, punched it well down among the coals, flung<lb>
away the poker, and turned about with a look and gesture<lb>
which would have been very comical if they had not<lb>
been decidedly pathetic, for, in spite of his years, a very<lb>
tender heart beat under the blue jacket, and it was grievously<lb>
wounded at the perfidy of the gentle little divinity<lb>
whom he worshipped with daily increasing ardor. His<lb>
eyes filled, but he winked resolutely; his lips trembled,<lb>
but he bit them hard; his hands doubled themselves up,<lb>
but he remembered his adversary was a woman; and, as<lb>
a last effort to preserve his masculine dignity, he began<lb>
to whistle.</p>
<p>As if the inconsistencies of womankind were to be<lb>
shown him as rapidly as possible, at this moment the<lb>
shower came on; for, taking him tenderly about the neck,<lb>
<pb n="134">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-151">

<figdesc>Page 134.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Dolly fell to weeping so infectiously, that, after standing<lb>
rigidly erect till a great tear dropped off the end of his<lb>
nose, Dick gave in, and laying his head on Dolly's<lb>
shoulder, the brother and sister quenched their anger,<lb>
washed away their malice, and soothed their sorrow by<lb>
one of those natural processes so kindly provided for<lb>
poor humanity, and so often despised as a weakness when<lb>
it might prove a better strength than any pride.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dick</hi> cleared up first, with no sign of the tempest but<lb>
a slight mist through which his native sunshine glimmered<lb>
pensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't, dear, don't cry so; it will make you sick, and<lb>
won't do any good, for things will come right, or I'll<lb>
make 'em, and we'll be comfortable all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we never can be as we were, and it's all my<lb>
fault. I've betrayed Fan's confidence, I've spoiled your<lb>
little romance, I've been a thoughtless, wicked girl, I've<lb>
lost August; and, oh, dear me, I wish I was dead!&rdquo;<lb>
with which funereal climax Dolly cried despairingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, don't be dismal, and blame yourself<lb>
for every trouble under the sun. Sit down and talk it<lb>
over, and see what can be done. Poor old girl, I forgive<lb>
you the notes, and say I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> wrong to meddle with Bopp.<lb>
I got you into the scrape, and I'll get you out if the sky<lb>
don't fall, or Bopp blow his brains out, like a second<lb>
Werther, before to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick drew the animated fountain to the wide chair,<lb>
where they had sat together since they were born, wiped<lb>
her eyes, and patted her back, with an idea that it was<lb>
soothing to babies, and why not to girls?</p>
<pb n="135">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish mother was at home,&rdquo; sighed Dolly, longing<lb>
for that port which was always a haven of refuge in<lb>
domestic squalls like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write, and tell her not to stay till Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it would spoil her visit, and you know she<lb>
deferred it to help us through this dreadful masquerade.<lb>
But I don't know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless your heart, it's simple enough. I'll tell<lb>
Bopp, beg his pardon, say `Dolly's willing,' and there<lb>
you are all taut and ship-shape again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't for the world, Dick. It would be very<lb>
hard for you, very awkward for me, and do no good in<lb>
the end; for August is so proud he'd never forgive you<lb>
for such a trick, would never believe that I `had a heart'<lb>
after all you've said and I've done; and I should only<lb>
hear with my own ears that he thanked me for that No.<lb>
Oh, why can't people know when they are in love, and<lb>
not go heels over head before they are ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that don't suit, I'll let it alone, for that is all<lb>
I can suggest; and if you like your woman's way better,<lb>
try it, only you'll have to fly round, because to-morrow is<lb>
the last night, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan't go, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? we are going to give him the rosewood<lb>
set of things, have speeches, cheers for the King of<lb>
Clubs, and no end of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't help it; there would be no fun for me, and I<lb>
couldn't look him in the face after all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pooh! yes you could, or it will be the first time<lb>
you dared not do damage with those wicked eyes of<lb>
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the first time I ever loved any one.&rdquo; Dolly's<lb>
<pb n="136">

</eaffig>
voice was so low, and her head drooped so much, that<lb>
this brief confession was apparently put away in Dick's<lb>
pocket; and, being an exceedingly novel one, filled<lb>
that ardent youth with a desire to deposit a similar<lb>
one in the other pocket, which, being emptied of its<lb>
accustomed contents, left a somewhat aching void in itself<lb>
and the heart underneath. After a moment's silence, he<lb>
said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won't go, you can settle it when he<lb>
comes here, though I think we should all do better to<lb>
confess coming home in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won't come here again, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't he! that shows you don't know Bopp as well as<lb>
I. He'll come to say good-by, to thank mother for her<lb>
kindness, and you and me for the little things we've done<lb>
for him (I wish I'd left the last undone!), and go away<lb>
like a gentleman, as he is, &mdash; see if he don't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? Then I must see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure he will, for we men don't bear malice and<lb>
sulk and bawl when we come to grief this way, but stand<lb>
up and take it without winking, like the young Spartan<lb>
brick when the fox was digging into him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then of course you'll forgive Fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll be hanged if I do,&rdquo; growled Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha! your theory is very good, sir, but your practice<lb>
is bosh,&rdquo; quoted Dolly, with a gleam of the old mischief<lb>
in her face.</p>
<p>Dick took a sudden turn through the room, burst out<lb>
laughing, and came back, saying heartily, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll own up; it is mean to feel so, and I'll think about<lb>
forgiving you both; but she may stop up the hole in the<lb>
wall, for she won't get any more letters just yet; and you<lb>

may devote your epistolary powers to A. Bopp in future.<lb>
Well, what is it? free your mind, and have done with it;<lb>
but don't make your nose red, or take the starch out of<lb>
my collar with any more salt water, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won't; and I only want to say that, as you<lb>
owe the explanation to us both, perhaps it would be best<lb>
for you to tell August your part of the thing as you come<lb>
home to-morrow, and then leave the rest to fate. I can't<lb>
let him go away thinking me such a heartless creature,<lb>
and once gone it will be too late to mend the matter.<lb>
Can you do this without getting me into another scrape,<lb>
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven't a doubt of it, and I call that sensible. I'll<lb>
fix it capitally, &mdash; go down on my knees in the mud, if it<lb>
is necessary; treat you like eggs for fear of another<lb>
smash-up; and bring him home in such a tip-top state,<lb>
you'll only have to nod and find yourself Mrs. B. any<lb>
day you like. Now let's kiss and be friends, and then<lb>
go pitch into that pie for luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they did; and an hour afterward were rioting in<lb>
the garret under pretence of putting grandma's things<lb>
away; for at eighteen, in spite of love and mischief, boys<lb>
and girls have a spell to exorcise blue devils, and a happy<lb>
faculty of forgetting that &ldquo;the world is hollow, and their<lb>
dolls stuffed with sawdust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was right, for on the following evening, after the<lb>
lesson, Mr. Bopp did go home with him, &ldquo;to say good-by,<lb>
like a gentleman as he was.&rdquo; Dolly got over the first<lb>
greeting in the dusky hall, and as her guest passed on to<lb>
the parlor, she popped her head out to ask anxiously, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say anything, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn't; something has happened to him; he'll<lb>

tell you about it. I'm going to see to the horse, so take<lb>
your time, and do what you like;&rdquo; with which vague<lb>
information Dick vanished, and Dolly wished herself anywhere<lb>
but where she was.</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp sat before the fire, looking so haggard and<lb>
worn-out that the girl's conscience pricked her sorely for<lb>
her part in the change; but plucking up her courage, she<lb>
stirred briskly among the tea-cups, asking, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I give you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I haf no care to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his spiritless mien and sorrowful voice<lb>
made Dolly's eyes fill; but knowing she must depend<lb>
upon herself now, and make the best of her position, she<lb>
said kindly, yet nervously, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look tired: let me do something for you if I<lb>
can; shall I sing for you a little? you once said music<lb>
rested you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are kind; I could like that I think. Excoose<lb>
me if I am dull, I haf, &mdash; yes, a little air if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More and more disturbed by his absent, troubled manner,<lb>
Dolly began a German song he had taught her, but<lb>
before the first line was sung he stopped her with an<lb>
imploring, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Gott sake not that! I cannot hear it this night;<lb>
it was the last I sung her in the Vaterland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bopp, what is it? Dick says you have a trouble;<lb>
tell me, and let us help you if we can. Are you<lb>
ill, in want, or has any one injured you in any way?<lb>
Oh, let me help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears had been streaming down Mr. Bopp's cheeks,<lb>
but as she spoke he checked them, and tried to answer<lb>
steadily, &mdash;</p>
<pb n="139">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-156">

<figdesc>Page 139.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not ill; I haf no wants now, and no one<lb>
has hurt me but in kindness; yet I haf so great a grief,<lb>
I could not bear it all alone, and so I came to ask a little<lb>
sympathy from your good Mutter, who has been kind<lb>
to me as if I was a son. She is not here, and I thought<lb>
I would stop back my grief; but that moosic was too<lb>
much; you pity me, and so I tell you. See, now! when<lb>
I find things go bright with me, and haf a hope of much<lb>
work, I take the little store I saved, I send it to my<lb>
friend Carl Hoffman, who is coming from my home, and<lb>
say, `Bring Ulla to me now, for I can make life go well<lb>
to her, and I am hungry till I haf her in my arms again.'<lb>
I tell no one, for I am bold to think that one day I come<lb>
here with her in my hand, to let her thank you in her so<lb>
sweet way for all you haf done for me. Well, I watch<lb>
the wind, I count the days, I haf no rest for joy; and<lb>
when Carl comes, I fly to him. He gifs me back my<lb>
store, he falls upon my neck and does not speak, then I<lb>
know my little girl will never come, for she has gone to<lb>
Himmel before I could make a home for her on earth.<lb>
Oh, my Ulla! it is hard to bear;&rdquo; and poor Mr. Bopp<lb>
covered his face, and laid it down on his empty plate, as<lb>
if he never cared to lift it up again.</p>
<p>Then Dolly forgot herself in her great sympathy, and,<lb>
going to him, she touched the bent head with a soothing<lb>
hand; let her tears flow to comfort his; and whispered<lb>
in her tenderest voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Bopp, I wish I could cure this sorrow, but<lb>
as I cannot, let me bear it with you; let me tell you how<lb>
we loved the little child, and longed to see her; how we<lb>
should have rejoiced to know you had so dear a friend to<lb>
make your life happy in this strange land; how we shall<lb>
<pb n="140">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-157">

<figdesc>Page 140.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
grieve for your great loss, and long to prove our respect<lb>
and love for you. I cannot say this as I ought, but, oh,<lb>
be comforted, for you will see the child again, and,<lb>
remembering that she waits for you, you will be glad to<lb>
go when God calls you to meet your Ulla in that other<lb>
Fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I will go now! I haf no wish to stay, for all<lb>
my life is black to me. If I had found that other little<lb>
friend to fill her place, I should not grieve so much,<lb>
because she is weller there above than I could make her<lb>
here; but no: I wait for that other one; I save all my<lb>
heart for her; I send it, but it comes back to me; then<lb>
I know my hope is dead, and I am all alone in the<lb>
strange land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was neither bitterness nor reproach in these<lb>
broken words, only a patient sorrow, a regretful pain, as<lb>
if he saw the two lost loves before him, and uttered over<lb>
them an irrepressible lament. It was too much for<lb>
Dolly, and with sudden resolution she spoke out fast and<lb>
low, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bopp, that was a mistake. It was not me you<lb>
saw at the masque; it was Dick. He played a cruel<lb>
trick; he insulted you and wronged me by that deceit,<lb>
and I find it very hard to pardon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! what is that?&rdquo; and Mr. Bopp looked up with<lb>
tears still shining in his beard, and intense surprise in<lb>
every feature of his face.</p>
<p>Dolly turned scarlet, and her heart beat fast as she<lb>
repeated with an unsteady voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Dick, not me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cloud swept over Mr. Bopp's face, and he knit his<lb>
brows a moment as if Dolly had not been far from right<lb>
<pb n="141">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-158">

<figdesc>Page 141.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
when she said &ldquo;he never would forgive the joke.&rdquo; Presently,<lb>
he spoke in a tone she had never heard before, &mdash;<lb>
cold and quiet, &mdash; and in his eye she thought she read<lb>
contempt for her brother and herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see now, and I say no more but this; it was not<lb>
kind when I so trusted you. Yet it is well, for you and<lb>
Richart are so one, I haf no doubt he spoke your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a desperate state of things. Dolly had done<lb>
her best, yet he did not, or would not, understand, and<lb>
before she could restrain them, the words slipped over<lb>
her tongue, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Dick and I never agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp started, swept three spoons and a tea-cup off<lb>
the table as he turned, for something in the hasty whisper<lb>
reassured him. The color sprang up to his cheek, the<lb>
old warmth to his eye, the old erectness to his figure, and<lb>
the eager accent to his voice. He rose, drew Dolly<lb>
nearer, took her face between his hands, and bending,<lb>
fixed on her a look tender, yet commanding, as he said,<lb>
with an earnestness that stirred her as words had never<lb>
done before, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dollee, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> said No! do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> say Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not speak, but her heart stood up in her<lb>
eyes, and answered him so eloquently that he was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord, it's all right!&rdquo; thought Dick, as,<lb>
peeping in at the window ten minutes later, he saw Dolly<lb>
enthroned upon Mr. Bopp's knee, both her hands in his,<lb>
and an expression in her April countenance which proved<lb>
that she found it natural and pleasant to be sitting there,<lb>
with her head on the kind heart that loved her; to hear<lb>
herself called &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">meine leibchen</hi>&rdquo;; to know that she alone<lb>
<pb n="142">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-159">

<figdesc>Page 142.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
could comfort him for little Ulla's loss, and fill her empty<lb>
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make a very pretty landscape, but too much<lb>
honey isn't good for 'em, so I'll go in, and we'll eat,<lb>
drink, and be merry, in honor of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rattled the latch and tramped on the mat, to warn<lb>
them of his approach, and appeared just as Dolly was<lb>
skimming into a chair, and Mr. Bopp picking up the<lb>
spoons, which he dropped again to meet Dick, and kissing<lb>
him on both cheeks, after the fashion of his country,<lb>
as he said, pointing to Dolly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, it is all fine again. I forgif you, and leave all<lb>
blame to that bad spirit, Mephistopheles, who has much<lb>
pranks like that, but never pays one for their pain, as<lb>
you haf me. Heart's dearest, come and say a friendly<lb>
word to Richart, then we will haf a little health: Long<lb>
life and happiness to the King of Clubs and the Queen<lb>
of Hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, August, and as he's to be a farmer, we'll add<lb>
another: `Wiser wits and better manners to the Knave<lb>
of Spades.&rdquo;'</p>

</p>
<p>AH, dear me, dear me, I'm a deal too comfortable!&rdquo;<lb>
Judging from appearances, Mrs. Podgers certainly had<lb>
some cause for that unusual exclamation. To begin<lb>
with, the room was comfortable. It was tidy, bright,<lb>
and warm; full of cosy corners and capital contrivances<lb>
for quiet enjoyment. The chairs seemed to extend their<lb>
plump arms invitingly; the old-fashioned sofa was so<lb>
hospitable, that whoever sat down upon it was slow to get<lb>
up; the pictures, though portraits, did not stare one out<lb>
of countenance, but surveyed the scene with an air of<lb>
tranquil enjoyment; and the unshuttered windows allowed<lb>
the cheery light to shine out into the snowy street<lb>
through blooming screens of Christmas roses and white<lb>
chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>The fire was comfortable; for it was neither hidden in<lb>
a stove nor imprisoned behind bars, but went rollicking<lb>
up the wide chimney with a jovial roar. It flickered<lb>
over the supper-table as if curious to discover what<lb>
savory viands were concealed under the shining covers.<lb>
It touched up the old portraits till they seemed to wink;<lb>
it covered the walls with comical shadows, as if the portly<lb>
chairs had set their arms akimbo and were dancing a<lb>
jig; it flashed out into the street with a voiceless greeting<lb>
to every passer-by; it kindled mimic fires in the<lb>
<pb n="144">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-161">

<figdesc>Page 144.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
brass andirons and the teapot simmering on the hob,<lb>
and, best of all, it shone its brightest on Mrs. Podgers,<lb>
as if conscious that it couldn't do a better thing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Podgers was comfortable as she sat there, buxom,<lb>
blooming, and brisk, in spite of her forty years and her<lb>
widow's cap. Her black gown was illuminated to such<lb>
an extent that it couldn't look sombre; her cap had<lb>
given up trying to be prim long ago, and cherry ribbons<lb>
wouldn't have made it more becoming as it set off her<lb>
crisp black hair, and met in a coquettish bow under her<lb>
plump chin; her white apron encircled her trim waist,<lb>
as if conscious of its advantages; and the mourning-pin<lb>
upon her bosom actually seemed to twinkle with satisfaction<lb>
at the enviable post it occupied.</p>
<p>The sleek cat, purring on the hearth, was comfortable,<lb>
so was the agreeable fragrance of muffins that pervaded<lb>
the air, so was the drowsy tick of the clock in the corner;<lb>
and if anything was needed to give a finishing touch to<lb>
the general comfort of the scene, the figure pausing in<lb>
the doorway supplied the want most successfully.</p>
<p>Heroes are always expected to be young and comely,<lb>
also fierce, melancholy, or at least what novel-readers<lb>
call &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;; but I am forced to own that my<lb>
present hero was none of these. Half the real beauty,<lb>
virtue, and romance of the world gets put into humble<lb>
souls, hidden in plain bodies. Mr. Jerusalem Turner<lb>
was an example of this; and, at the risk of shocking<lb>
my sentimental readers, I must frankly state that he was<lb>
fifty, stout, and bald, also that he used bad grammar,<lb>
had a double chin, and was only the Co. in a prosperous<lb>
grocery store. A hale and hearty old gentleman, with<lb>
cheerful brown eyes, a ruddy countenance, and curly gray<lb>
<pb n="145">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-162">

<figdesc>Page 145.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hair sticking up all round his head, with an air of energy<lb>
and independence that was pleasant to behold. There<lb>
he stood, beaming upon the unconscious Mrs. Podgers,<lb>
softly rubbing his hands, and smiling to himself with the<lb>
air of a man enjoying the chief satisfaction of his life,<lb>
as he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear me, dear me, I'm a deal too comfortable!&rdquo;<lb>
sighed Mrs. Podgers, addressing the teapot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, mum, not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In walked the gentleman, and up rose the lady, saying,<lb>
with a start and an aspect of relief, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, I didn't hear you! I began to think you<lb>
were never coming to your tea, Mr. 'Rusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody called him Mr. 'Rusalem, and many people<lb>
were ignorant that he had any other name. He liked it,<lb>
for it began with the children, and the little voices had<lb>
endeared it to him, not to mention the sound of it from<lb>
Mrs Podgers' lips for ten years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I'm late, mum, but I really couldn't help it.<lb>
To-night's a busy time, and the lads are just good for<lb>
nothing with their jokes and spirits, so I stayed to steady'<lb>
em, and do a little job that turned up unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit right down and have your tea while you can,<lb>
then. I've kept it warm for you, and the muffins are<lb>
done lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Podgers bustled about with an alacrity that<lb>
seemed to give an added relish to the supper; and when<lb>
her companion was served, she sat smiling at him with<lb>
her hand on the teapot, ready to replenish his cup before<lb>
he could ask for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have things been fretting of you, mum? You<lb>
looked down-hearted as I came in, and that ain't<lb>
<pb n="146">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-163">

<figdesc>Page 146.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
accordin' to the time of year, which is merry,&rdquo; said Mr.'<lb>
Rusalem, stirring his tea with a sense of solid satisfaction<lb>
that would have sweetened a far less palatable draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's the teapot; I don't know what's got into it<lb>
to-night; but, as I was waiting for you, it set me<lb>
thinking of one thing and another, till I declare I felt as<lb>
if it had up and spoke to me, showing me how I wasn't<lb>
grateful enough for my blessings, but a deal more comfortable<lb>
than I deserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While speaking, Mrs. Podgers' eyes rested on an<lb>
inscription which encircled the corpulent little silver teapot:<lb>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">To our Benefactor.&mdash;They who give to the poor lend<lb>
to the Lord.</hi>&rdquo; Now one wouldn't think there was anything<lb>
in the speech or the inscription to disturb Mr.'<lb>
Rusalem; but there seemed to be, for he fidgeted in his<lb>
chair, dropped his fork, and glanced at the teapot with a<lb>
very odd expression. It was a capital little teapot, solid,<lb>
bright as hands could make it, and ornamented with a<lb>
robust young cherub perched upon the lid, regardless of<lb>
the warmth of his seat. With her eyes still fixed upon<lb>
it, Mrs. Podgers continued meditatively, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how fond I am of the teapot for poor<lb>
Podgers' sake. I really feel quite superstitious about<lb>
it; and when thoughts come to me, as I sit watching it,<lb>
I have faith in them, because they always remind me of<lb>
the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, after vain efforts to restrain himself, Mr. 'Rusalem<lb>
broke into a sudden laugh, so hearty and infectious<lb>
that Mrs. Podgers couldn't help smiling, even while she<lb>
shook her head at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, mum, it's hysterical; I'll never do it<lb>
<pb n="147">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-164">

<figdesc>Page 147.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
again,&rdquo; panted Mr. 'Rusalem, as he got his breath, and<lb>
went soberly on with his supper.</p>
<p>It was a singular fact that whenever the teapot was<lb>
particularly alluded to he always behaved in this incomprehensible<lb>
manner, &mdash; laughed, begged pardon, said it<lb>
was hysterical, and promised never to do it again. It<lb>
used to trouble Mrs. Podgers very much, but she had<lb>
grown used to it; and having been obliged to overlook<lb>
many oddities in the departed Podgers, she easily forgave'<lb>
Rusalem his only one. After the laugh there was a<lb>
pause, during which Mrs. Podgers sat absently polishing<lb>
up the silver cherub, with the memory of the little son<lb>
who died two Christmases ago lying heavy at her heart,<lb>
and Mr. 'Rusalem seemed to be turning something over<lb>
in his mind as he watched a bit of butter sink luxuriously<lb>
into the warm bosom of a muffin. Once or twice<lb>
he paused as if listening, several times he stole a look at<lb>
Mrs. Podgers, and presently said, in a somewhat anxious<lb>
tone, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was saying just now that you was a deal too<lb>
comfortable, mum; would you wish to be made uncomfortable<lb>
in order to realize your blessings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should. I'm getting lazy, selfish, and forgetful<lb>
of other folks. You leave me nothing to do, and<lb>
make everything so easy for me that I'm growing young<lb>
and giddy again. Now that isn't as it should be,'<lb>
Rusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It meets my views exactly, mum. You've had your<lb>
hard times, your worryments and cares, and now it's<lb>
right to take your rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don't you take yours? I'm sure you've<lb>
<pb n="148">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-165">

<figdesc>Page 148.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
earned it drudging thirty years in the store, with more<lb>
extra work than holidays for your share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, mum, it's different with me, you know.<lb>
Business is amusing; and I'm so used to it I shouldn't<lb>
know myself if I was out of the store for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you are saving up something against<lb>
the time when business won't be amusing. You are so<lb>
generous, I'm afraid you forget you can't work for other<lb>
people all your days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum, I've put by a little sum in a safe bank<lb>
that pays good interest, and when I'm past work I'll fall<lb>
back and enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To judge from the cheerful content of the old gentleman's<lb>
face he was enjoying it already, as he looked about<lb>
him with the air of a man who had made a capital<lb>
investment, and was in the receipt of generous dividends.<lb>
Seeing Mrs. Podgers' bright eye fixed upon him, as<lb>
if she suspected something, and would have the truth<lb>
out of him in two minutes, he recalled the conversation<lb>
to the point from which it had wandered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would like to try how a little misery suits<lb>
you, mum, I can accommodate you if you'll step upstairs.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, what do you mean? Who's up there?<lb>
Why didn't you tell me before?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Podgers, in<lb>
a flutter of interest, curiosity, and surprise, as he knew<lb>
she would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, mum, I was doubtful how you'd like it. I<lb>
did it without stopping to think, and then I was afraid<lb>
you'd consider it a liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. 'Rusalem spoke with some hesitation; but Mrs.<lb>
Podgers didn't wait to hear him, for she was already at<lb>
<pb n="149">

<milestn unit="collation" n="9">
the door, lamp in hand, and would have been off had she<lb>
known where to go, &ldquo;up-stairs&rdquo; being a somewhat vague<lb>
expression. The old gentleman led the way to the room<lb>
he had occupied for thirty years, in spite of Mrs. Podgers'<lb>
frequent offers of a better and brighter one. He<lb>
was attached to it, small and dark as it was, for the joys<lb>
and sorrows of more than half his life had come to him<lb>
in that little room, and somehow when he was there it<lb>
brightened up amazingly. Mrs. Podgers looked well<lb>
about her, but saw nothing new, and her conductor said,<lb>
as he paused beside the bed, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you how I found it before I show it. You<lb>
see, mum, I had to step down the street just at dark, and<lb>
passing the windows I give a glance in, as I've a bad<lb>
habit of doing when the lamps is lighted and you a setting<lb>
there alone. Well, mum, what did I see outside but<lb>
a ragged little chap a flattening his nose against the<lb>
glass, and staring in with all his eyes. I didn't blame<lb>
him much for it, and on I goes without a word. When<lb>
I came back I see him a lying close to the wall, and<lb>
mistrusting that he was up to some game that might give<lb>
you a scare, I speaks to him: he don't answer; I<lb>
touches him: he don't stir; then I picks him up, and seeing<lb>
that he's gone in a fit or a faint, I makes for the<lb>
store with a will. He come to rapid; and finding that<lb>
he was most froze and starved, I fed and warmed and<lb>
fixed him a trifle, and then tucked him away here, for<lb>
he's got no folks to worry for him, and was too used up<lb>
to go out again to-night. That's the story, mum; and<lb>
now I'll produce the little chap if I can find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Mr. 'Rusalem began to grope about the bed,<lb>
chuckling, yet somewhat anxious, for not a vestige of an<lb>
<pb n="150">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-167">

<figdesc>Page 150.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
occupant appeared, till a dive downward produced a sudden<lb>
agitation of the clothes, a squeak, and the unexpected<lb>
appearance out at the foot of the bed of a singular figure,<lb>
that dodged into a corner, with one arm up, as if to<lb>
ward off a blow, while a sleepy little voice exclaimed<lb>
beseechingly, &ldquo;I'm up, I'm up, don't hit me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord love the child, who'd think of doing that!<lb>
Wake up, Joe, and see your friends,&rdquo; said Mr. 'Rusalem,<lb>
advancing cautiously.</p>
<p>At the sound of his voice down went the arm, and<lb>
Mrs. Podgers saw a boy of nine or ten, arrayed in a<lb>
flannel garment that evidently belonged to Mr. 'Rusalem,<lb>
for though none too long it was immensely broad, and<lb>
the voluminous sleeves were pinned up, showing a pair<lb>
of wasted arms, chapped with cold and mottled with<lb>
bruises. A large blue sock still covered one foot, the<lb>
other was bound up as if hurt. A tall cotton nightcap,<lb>
garnished with a red tassel, looked like a big extinguisher<lb>
on a small candle; and from under it a pair of dark,<lb>
hollow eyes glanced sharply with a shrewd, suspicious<lb>
look, that made the little face more pathetic than the<lb>
marks of suffering, neglect, and abuse, which told the<lb>
child's story without words. As if quite reassured by'<lb>
Rusalem's presence, the boy shuffled out of his corner,<lb>
saving coolly, as he prepared to climb into his nest<lb>
again, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was the old one when you grabbed me.<lb>
Ain't this bed a first-rater, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. 'Rusalem lifted the composed young personage<lb>
into the middle of the big bed, where he sat bolt upright,<lb>
surveying the prospect from under the extinguisher with<lb>
an equanimity that quite took the good lady's breath<lb>
<pb n="151">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-168">

<figdesc>Page 151.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
away. But Mr. 'Rusalem fell back and pointed to him,<lb>
saying, &ldquo;There he is, mum,&rdquo; with as much pride and<lb>
satisfaction as if he had found some rare and valuable<lb>
treasure; for the little child was very precious in his<lb>
sight. Mrs. Podgers really didn't know whether to<lb>
laugh or cry, and settled the matter by plumping down<lb>
beside the boy, saying cordially, as she took the grimy<lb>
little hands into her own, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's heartily welcome, 'Rusalem. Now tell me all<lb>
about it, my poor dear, and don't be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, I ain't afraid a you nor he. I ain't got nothin'<lb>
to tell, only my name's Joe and I'm sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your mother, and where do you live, deary?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Mrs. Podgers, haunted with the idea that some<lb>
woman must be anxious for the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain't got any, we don't have 'em where I lives. The<lb>
old one takes care a me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the old one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granny. I works for her, and she lets me stay<lb>
alonger her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the dear! what work can such a mite do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaps a things. I sifs ashes, picks rags, goes beggin',<lb>
runs arrants, and sometimes the big fellers lets me<lb>
call papers. That's fun, only I gets knocked round,<lb>
and it hurts, you'd better believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come here begging, and, being afraid to ring,<lb>
stand outside looking in at me enjoying myself, like a<lb>
selfish creeter as I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to ask for the cold vittles a lookin' at warm<lb>
ones, and thinkin' if they was mine what I'd give the little<lb>
fellers when I has my tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your what, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Christmas-tree. Look a here, I've got it, and<lb>
all these to put on it to-morrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From under his pillow the boy produced a small<lb>
branch of hemlock, dropped from some tree on its passage<lb>
to a gayer festival than little Joe's; also an old<lb>
handkerchief which contained his treasures, &mdash; only a<lb>
few odds and ends picked up in the streets: a gnarly<lb>
apple, half-a-dozen nuts, two or three dingy bonbons,<lb>
gleaned from the sweepings of some store, and a bit of<lb>
cheese, which last possession he evidently prized highly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's for the old one; she likes it, and I kep it for<lb>
her, &mdash; cause she don't hit so hard when I fetch her<lb>
goodies. You don't mind, do you?&rdquo; he said, looking<lb>
inquiringly at Mr. 'Rusalem, who blew his nose like a<lb>
trumpet, and patted the big nightcap with a fatherly<lb>
gesture more satisfactory than words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you kept for yourself, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs.<lb>
Podgers, with an irrepressible sniff, as she looked at the<lb>
poor little presents, and remembered that they &ldquo;didn't<lb>
have mothers&rdquo; where the child lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had my treat alonger him,&rdquo; said the boy,<lb>
nodding toward 'Rusalem, and adding enthusiastically,<lb>
&ldquo;Wasn't that prime! It was real Christmasy a settin'<lb>
by the fire, eating lots and not bein' hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Podgers broke down; and, taking the boy<lb>
in her arms, sobbed over him as if she had found her<lb>
lost Neddy in this sad shape. The little lad regarded<lb>
her demonstration with some uneasiness at first, but<lb>
there is a magic about a genuine woman that wins its<lb>
way everywhere, and soon the outcast nestled to her,<lb>
feeling that this wonderful night was getting more<lb>
&ldquo;Christmasy&rdquo; every minute.</p>
<pb n="153">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-170">

<figdesc>Page 153.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Mrs. Podgers was herself again directly; and seeing<lb>
that the child's eyelids were heavy with weakness and<lb>
weariness, she made him comfortable among the pillows,<lb>
and began to sing the lullaby that used to hush her little<lb>
son to sleep. Mr. 'Rusalem took something from his<lb>
drawer, and was stealing away, when the child opened<lb>
his eyes and started up, calling out as he nodded, till the<lb>
tassel danced on this preposterous cap, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say! good night, good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking much gratified, Mr. 'Rusalem returned, shook<lb>
the little hand extended to him, kissed the grateful face,<lb>
and went away to sit on the stairs with tear after tear<lb>
dropping off the end of his nose, as he listened to the<lb>
voice that, after two years of silence, sung the air this<lb>
simple soul thought the loveliest in the world. At first,<lb>
it was more sob than song, but soon the soothing music<lb>
flowed on unbroken, and the wondering child, for the<lb>
first time within his memory, fell asleep in the sweet<lb>
shelter of a woman's arms.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Podgers came out, she found Mr. 'Rusalem<lb>
intent on stuffing another parcel into a long gray stocking<lb>
already full to overflowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the little chap, mum. He let fall that he'd<lb>
never done this sort of thing in his life, and as he hadn't<lb>
any stockings of his own, poor dear, I took the liberty<lb>
of lending him one of mine,&rdquo; explained Mr. 'Rusalem,<lb>
surveying the knobby article with evident regret that it<lb>
wasn't bigger.</p>
<p>Mrs. Podgers said nothing, but looked from the stocking<lb>
to the fatherly old gentleman who held it; and it is<lb>
my private belief, that if Mrs. Podgers had obeyed the<lb>
impulse of her heart, she would have forgotten decorum,<lb>
<pb n="154">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-171">

<figdesc>Page 154.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and kissed him on the spot. She didn't, however, but<lb>
went briskly into her own room, whence she presently<lb>
returned with red eyes, and a pile of small garments in<lb>
her hands. Having nearly exhausted his pincushion in<lb>
trying to suspend the heavy stocking, Mr. 'Rusalem had<lb>
just succeeded as she appeared. He saw what she<lb>
carried, watched her arrange the little shirt, jacket and<lb>
trousers, the half-worn shoes and tidy socks, beside the<lb>
bed, with motherly care, and stand looking at the uncouscious<lb>
child, with an expression which caused Mr.'<lb>
Rusalem to dart down stairs, and compose himself by<lb>
rubbing his hair erect, and shaking his fist in the painted<lb>
face of the late Podgers.</p>
<p>An hour or two later the store was closed, the room<lb>
cleared, Mrs. Podgers in her arm-chair on one side of<lb>
the hearth, with her knitting in her hand, Mr. 'Rusalem<lb>
in his arm-chair on the other side, with his newspaper on<lb>
his knee, both looking so cosy and comfortable that any<lb>
one would have pronounced them a Darby and Joan on<lb>
the spot. Ah, but they weren't, you see, and that spoilt<lb>
the illusion, to one party at least. Both were rather<lb>
silent, both looked thoughtfully at the fire, and the fire<lb>
gave them both excellent counsel, as it seldom fails to do<lb>
when it finds any kindred warmth and brightness in the<lb>
hearts and souls of those who study it. Mrs. Podgers<lb>
kindled first, and broke out suddenly with a nod of great<lb>
determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Rusalem, I'm going to keep that boy if it's possible!&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall, mum, whether it's possible or not,&rdquo; he<lb>
answered, nodding back at her with equal decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know why I never thought of such a thing<lb>
<pb n="155">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-172">

<figdesc>Page 155.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
before. There's a many children suffering for mothers,<lb>
and heaven knows I'm wearying for some little child to fill<lb>
my Neddy's place. I wonder if you didn't think of this<lb>
when you took that boy in; it would be just like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. 'Rusalem shook his head, but looked so guilty,<lb>
that Mrs. Podgers was satisfied, called him &ldquo;a thoughtful<lb>
dear,&rdquo; within herself, and kindled still more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between you, and Joe, and the teapot, I've got<lb>
another idea into my stupid head, and I know you won't<lb>
laugh at it. That loving little soul has tried to get a<lb>
tree for some poor babies who have no one to think of<lb>
them but him, and even remembered the old one, who<lb>
must be a wretch to hit that child, and hit hard, too, I<lb>
know by the looks of his arms. Well, I've a great<lb>
longing to go and give him a tree,&mdash;a right good one, like<lb>
those Neddy used to have; to get in the `little fellers'<lb>
he tells of, give them a good dinner, and then a regular<lb>
Christmas frolic. Can't it be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be easier, mum;&rdquo; and Mr. 'Rusalem,<lb>
who had been taking counsel with the fire till he quite<lb>
glowed with warmth and emotion, nodded, smiled, and<lb>
rubbed his hands, as if Mrs. Podgers had invited him to<lb>
a Lord Mayor's feast, or some equally gorgeous jollification.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it's the day, and thinking of how it came<lb>
to be, that makes me feel as if I wanted to help everybody,<lb>
and makes this Christmas so bright and happy that<lb>
I never can forget it,&rdquo; continued the good woman, with<lb>
a heartiness that made her honest face quite beautiful to<lb>
behold.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Podgers had only known what was going on<lb>
under the capacious waistcoat opposite, she would have<lb>
<pb n="156">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-173">

<figdesc>Page 156.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
held her tongue; for the more charitable, earnest, and<lb>
tender-hearted she grew, the harder it became for Mr.'<lb>
Rusalem to restrain the declaration which had been<lb>
hovering on his lips ever since old Podgers died. As<lb>
the comely relict sat there talking in that genial way,<lb>
and glowing with good-will to all mankind, it was too<lb>
much for Mr. 'Rusalem; and finding it impossible to<lb>
resist the desire to know his fate, he yielded to it, gave<lb>
a porpentous hem, and said abruptly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mum, have I done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done what?&rdquo; asked Mrs. P., going on with her<lb>
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made you uncomfortable, according to promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no, you've made me very happy, and will<lb>
have to try again,&rdquo; she answered, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke Mr. 'Rusalem drew his chair nearer,<lb>
leaned forward, and looking straight at her, said deliberately,<lb>
though his voice shook a little, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Podgers, I love you hearty; would you have<lb>
any objections to marrying of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a word said Mrs. Podgers; but her knitting<lb>
dropped out of her hand, and she looked as uncomfortable<lb>
as she could desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that would do it,&rdquo; muttered Mr. 'Rusalem;<lb>
but went on steadily, though his ruddy face got paler and<lb>
paler, his voice huskier and huskier, and his heart fuller<lb>
and fuller every word he attempted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, mum, I have took the liberty of loving you<lb>
ever since you came, more than ten years ago. I was<lb>
eager to make it known long before this, but Podgers<lb>
spoke first and then it was no use. It come hard for a<lb>
<pb n="157">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-174">

<figdesc>Page 157.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
time, but I learned to give you up, though I couldn't<lb>
learn not to love you, being as it was impossible. Since<lb>
Podgers died I've turned it over in my mind frequent,<lb>
but felt as if I was too old, and rough, and poor every<lb>
way to ask so much. Lately, the wish has growed too<lb>
strong for me, and to-night it won't be put down. If<lb>
you want a trial, mum, I should be that I'll warrant, for<lb>
do my best, I could never be all I'm wishful of being<lb>
for your sake. Would you give it name, and if not<lb>
agreeable, we'll let it drop, mum, we'll let it drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it hadn't been for the teapot, Mrs. Podgers would<lb>
have said Yes at once. The word was on her lips, but as<lb>
she looked up the fire flashed brightly on the teapot<lb>
(which always occupied the place of honor on the<lb>
sideboard, for Mrs. P. was intensely proud of it), and<lb>
she stopped to think, for it reminded her of something.<lb>
In order to explain this, we must keep Mr. 'Rusalem<lb>
waiting for his answer a minute.</p>
<p>Rather more than ten years ago, old Podgers happening<lb>
to want a housekeeper, invited a poor relation to fill<lb>
that post in his bachelor establishment. He never would<lb>
have thought of marrying her, though the young woman<lb>
was both notable and handsome, if he hadn't discovered<lb>
that his partner loved her. Whereupon the perverse old<lb>
fellow immediately proposed, lest he should lose his<lb>
housekeeper, and was accepted from motives of gratitude.<lb>
Mrs. Podgers was a dutiful wife, but not a very<lb>
happy one, for the world said that Mr. P. was a hard,<lb>
miserly man, and his wife was forced to believe the<lb>
world in the right, till the teapot changed her opinion.<lb>
There happened to be much suffering among the poor<lb>
one year, owing to the burning of the mills, and<lb>
<pb n="158">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-175">

<figdesc>Page 158.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
contributions were solicited for their relief. Old Podgers,<lb>
though a rich man, refused to give a penny, but it was<lb>
afterwards discovered that his private charities exceeded<lb>
many more ostentatious ones, and the word &ldquo;miserly&rdquo;<lb>
was changed to &ldquo;peculiar.&rdquo; When times grew prosperous<lb>
again, the workmen, whose families had been so<lb>
quietly served, clubbed together, got the teapot, and left<lb>
it at Mr. Podgers' door one Christmas Eve. But the<lb>
old gentleman never saw it; his dinner had been too<lb>
much for him, and apoplexy took him off that very<lb>
afternoon.</p>
<p>In the midst of her grief Mrs. Podgers was surprised,<lb>
touched and troubled by this revelation, for she had<lb>
known nothing of the affair till the teapot came. Womanlike,<lb>
she felt great remorse for what now seemed like<lb>
blindness and ingratitude; she fancied she owed him<lb>
some atonement, and remembering how often he had<lb>
expressed a hope that she wouldn't marry again after he<lb>
was gone, she resolved to gratify him. The buxom<lb>
widow had had many opportunities of putting off her<lb>
weeds, but she had refused all offers without regret till<lb>
now. The teapot reminded her of Podgers and her vow;<lb>
and though her heart rebelled, she thought it her duty to<lb>
check the answer that sprung to her lips, and slowly, but<lb>
decidedly, replied, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm truly grateful to you, 'Rusalem, but I couldn't<lb>
do it. Don't think you'd ever be a trial, for you're the<lb>
last man to be that to any woman. It's a feeling I have<lb>
that it wouldn't be kind to Podgers. I can't forget how<lb>
much I owe him, how much I wronged him, and how<lb>
much I can please him by staying as I am, for his<lb>
<pb n="159">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-176">

<figdesc>Page 159.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
frequent words were, `Keep the property together, and<lb>
don't marry, Jane.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, mum, then we'll let it drop, and fall back<lb>
into the old ways. Don't fret yourself about it, I shall<lb>
bear up, and &mdash;&rdquo; there Mr. 'Rusalem's voice gave out,<lb>
and he sat frowning at the fire, bent on bearing up manfully,<lb>
though it was very hard to find that Podgers dead<lb>
as well as Podgers living was to keep from him the happiness<lb>
he had waited for so long. His altered face and<lb>
broken voice were almost too much for Mrs. P., and she<lb>
found it necessary to confirm her resolution by telling it.<lb>
Laying one hand on his shoulder, she pointed to the teapot<lb>
with the other, saying gently, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day that came and I found out how good he<lb>
was, too late to beg his pardon and love him for it, I<lb>
said to myself, `I'll be true to Podgers till I die, because<lb>
that's all I can do now to show my repentance and respect.'<lb>
But for that feeling and that promise I couldn't<lb>
say No to you, 'Rusalem, for you've been my best friend<lb>
all these years, and I'll be yours all my life, though I<lb>
can't be anything else, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time since its arrival, the mention of the<lb>
teapot did not produce the accustomed demonstration<lb>
from Mr. 'Rusalem. On the contrary, he looked at it<lb>
with a momentary expression of indignation and disgust,<lb>
strongly suggestive of an insane desire to cast the precious<lb>
relic on the floor and trample on it. If any such<lb>
temptation did assail him, he promptly curbed it, and<lb>
looked about the room with a forlorn air, that made<lb>
Mrs. Podgers hate herself, as he meekly answered, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm obliged to you, mum; the feeling does you<lb>
<pb n="160">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-177">

<figdesc>Page 160.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
honor. Don't mind me, it's rather a blow, but I'll be<lb>
up again directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He retired behind his paper as he spoke, and Mrs.<lb>
Podgers spoilt her knitting in respectful silence, till Mr.'<lb>
Rusalem began to read aloud as usual, to assure her that<lb>
in spite of the blow he <hi rend="italics">was</hi> up again.</p>
<p>In the gray dawn the worthy gentleman was roused<lb>
from his slumbers, by a strange voice whispering shrilly<lb>
in his ear, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, there's two of em. Ain't it jolly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Starting up, he beheld a comical little goblin standing<lb>
at his bedside, with a rapturous expression of countenance,<lb>
and a pair of long gray stockings in its hands.<lb>
Both were heaping full, but one was evidently meant for<lb>
Mr. 'Rusalem, for every wish, whim and fancy of his<lb>
had been guessed, and gratified in a way that touched<lb>
him to the heart. If it were not indecorous to invade<lb>
the privacy of a gentleman's apartment, I could describe<lb>
how there were two boys in the big bed that morning;<lb>
how the old boy revelled in the treasures of his stocking<lb>
as heartily as the young one; how they laughed and<lb>
exclaimed, pulled each others nightcaps off, and had a<lb>
regular pillow fight; how little Joe was got into his new<lb>
clothes, and strutted like a small peacock in them; how<lb>
Mr. 'Rusalem made himself splendid in his Sunday best,<lb>
and spent ten good minutes in tying the fine cravat<lb>
somebody had hemmed for him. But lest it should be<lb>
thought improper, I will merely say, that nowhere in the<lb>
city did the sun shine on happier faces than these two<lb>
showed Mrs. Podgers, as Mr. 'Rusalem came in with<lb>
Joe on his shoulder, both wishing her a merry<lb>
<pb n="161">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-178">

<figdesc>Page 161.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="11">
Christmas, as heartily as if this were the first the world had<lb>
ever seen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Podgers was as brisk and blithe as they, though<lb>
she must have sat up one-half the night making presents<lb>
for them, and laid awake the other half making plans<lb>
for the day. As soon as she had hugged Joe, toasted<lb>
him red, and heaped his plate with everything on the<lb>
table, she told them the order of performances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as ever you can't eat any more you must<lb>
order home the tree, 'Rusalem, and then go with Joe to<lb>
invite the party, while I see to dinner, and dress up the<lb>
pine as well as I can in such a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum,&rdquo; answered Mr. 'Rusalem with alacrity;<lb>
though how she was going to do her part was not clear<lb>
to him. But he believed her capable of working any<lb>
miracle within the power of mortal woman; and having<lb>
plans of his own, he soon trudged away with Joe prancing<lb>
at his side, so like the lost Neddy, in the little cap<lb>
and coat, that Mrs. Podgers forgot her party to stand<lb>
watching them down the crowded street, with eyes that<lb>
saw very dimly when they looked away again.</p>
<p>Never mind how she did it, the miracle was wrought,<lb>
for Mrs. Podgers and her maid Betsey fell to work with<lb>
a will, and when women set their hearts on anything it<lb>
is a known fact that they seldom fail to accomplish it.<lb>
By noon everything was ready, the tree waiting in the<lb>
best parlor, the dinner smoking on the table, and Mrs.<lb>
Podgers at the window to catch the first glimpse of her<lb>
coming guests. A last thought struck her as she stood<lb>
waiting. There was but one high chair in the house,<lb>
and the big ones would be doubtless too low for the little<lb>
people. Bent on making them as comfortable as her<lb>
<pb n="162">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-179">

<figdesc>Page 162.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
motherly heart could desire, she set about mending the<lb>
matter by bringing out from Podgers' bookcase several<lb>
fat old ledgers, and arranging them in the chairs. While<lb>
busily dusting one of these it slipped from her hands,<lb>
and as it fell a paper fluttered from among the leaves.<lb>
She picked it up, looked at it, dropped her duster, and<lb>
became absorbed. It was a small sheet filled with figures,<lb>
and here and there short memoranda, &mdash; not an interesting<lb>
looking document in the least; but Mrs. Podgers<lb>
stood like a statue till she had read it several times; then<lb>
she caught her breath, clapped her hands, laughed and<lb>
cried together, and put the climax to her extraordinary<lb>
behavior by running across the room and embracing the<lb>
astonished little teapot.</p>
<p>How long she would have gone on in this wild manner<lb>
it is impossible to say, had not the the jingle of bells, and<lb>
a shrill, small cheer announced that the party had arrived.<lb>
Whisking the mysterious paper into her pocket, and<lb>
dressing her agitated countenance in smiles, she hastened<lb>
to open the door before chilly fingers could find the bell.</p>
<p>Such a merry load as that was! Such happy faces<lb>
looking out from under the faded hoods and caps! Such<lb>
a hearty &ldquo;Hurrah for Mrs. Podgers!&rdquo; greeted her<lb>
straight from the grateful hearts that loved her the<lb>
instant she appeared! And what a perfect Santa Claus<lb>
Mr. 'Rusalem made, with his sleigh full of bundles as<lb>
well as children, his face full of sunshine, his arms full<lb>
of babies, whom he held up that they too might clap<lb>
their little hands, while he hurrahed with all his might.<lb>
I really don't think reindeers, or the immemorial white<lb>
beard and fur cap, could have improved the picture; and<lb>
the neighbors were of my opinion, I suspect.</p>
<pb n="163">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-180">

<figdesc>Page 163.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>It was good to see Mrs. Podgers welcome them all in<lb>
a way that gave the shyest courage, made the poorest<lb>
forget patched jackets or ragged gowns, and caused them<lb>
all to feel that this indeed was merry Christmas. It<lb>
was better still to see Mrs. Podgers preside over the<lb>
table, dealing out turkey and pudding with such a bounteous<lb>
hand, that the small feasters often paused, in<lb>
sheer astonishment, at the abundance before them,<lb>
and then fell to again with renewed energy, as if they<lb>
feared to wake up presently and find the whole a dream.<lb>
It was best of all to see Mrs. Podgers gather them<lb>
about her afterwards, hearing their little stories, learning<lb>
their many wants, and winning their young hearts by<lb>
such gentle wiles that they soon regarded her as some<lb>
beautiful, benignant fairy, who had led them from a cold,<lb>
dark world into the land of innocent delights they had<lb>
imagined, longed for, yet never hoped to find.</p>
<p>Then came the tree, hung thick with bonbons, fruit<lb>
and toys, gay mittens and tippets, comfortable socks and<lb>
hoods, and, lower down, more substantial but less showy<lb>
gifts; for Mrs Podgers had nearly exhausted the Dorcas<lb>
basket that fortunately chanced to be with her just then.<lb>
There was no time for candles, but, as if he understood<lb>
the matter and was bent on supplying all deficiencies, the<lb>
sun shone gloriously on the little tree, and made it doubly<lb>
splendid in the children's eyes.</p>
<p>It would have touched the hardest heart to watch the<lb>
poor little creatures, as they trooped in and stood about<lb>
the wonderful tree. Some seemed ready to go wild with<lb>
delight, some folded their hands and sighed with solemn<lb>
satisfaction, others looked as if bewildered by such<lb>
unwonted and unexpected good fortune; and when Mr.<lb>
<pb n="164">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-181">

<figdesc>Page 164.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
'Rusalem told them how this fruitful tree had sprung up<lb>
from their loving playmate's broken bough, little Joe hid<lb>
his face in Mrs. Podgers' gown, and could find no vent<lb>
for his great happiness but tears. It was not a large<lb>
tree, but it took a long while to strip it; and even when<lb>
the last gilded nut was gone the children still lingered<lb>
about it, as if they regarded it with affection as a generous<lb>
benefactor, and were loath to leave it.</p>
<p>Next they had a splendid round of games. I don't<lb>
know what will be thought of the worthy souls, but Mr.'<lb>
Rusalem and Mrs. Podgers played with all their might.<lb>
Perhaps the reason why he gave himself up so freely to<lb>
the spirit of the hour was, that his disappointment was<lb>
very heavy; and, according to his simple philosophy, it<lb>
was wiser to soothe his wounded heart and cheer his sad<lb>
spirit with the sweet society of little children, than to<lb>
curse fate and reproach a woman. What was Mrs.<lb>
Podgers' reason it is impossible to tell, but she behaved<lb>
as if some secret satisfaction filled her heart so full that<lb>
she was glad to let it bubble over in this harmless<lb>
fashion. Both tried to be children again, and both succeeded<lb>
capitally, though now and then their hearts got<lb>
the better of them. When Mr. 'Rusalem was blinded he<lb>
tossed all the little lads up to the ceiling when he caught<lb>
them, kissed all the little girls, and, that no one might<lb>
feel slighted, kissed Mrs. Podgers also. When they<lb>
played &ldquo;Open the gates,&rdquo; and the two grown people<lb>
stood hand in hand while the mirthful troops marched<lb>
under the tall arch, Mrs. Podgers never once looked Mr.'<lb>
Rusalem in the face, but blushed and kept her eyes on<lb>
the ground, as if she was a bashful girl playing games<lb>
with some boyish sweetheart. The children saw nothing<lb>
<pb n="165">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-182">

<figdesc>Page 165.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of all this, and, bless their innocent little hearts! they<lb>
wouldn't have understood it if they had; but it was perfectly<lb>
evident that the gray-headed gentleman and the<lb>
mature matron had forgotten all about their years, and<lb>
were in their teens again; for true love is gifted with<lb>
immortal youth.</p>
<p>When weary with romping, they gathered round the<lb>
fire, and Mr. 'Rusalem told fairy tales, as if his dull<lb>
ledgers had preserved these childish romances like flowers<lb>
between their leaves, and kept them fresh in spite of<lb>
time. Mrs. Podgers sung to them, and made them sing<lb>
with her, till passers-by smiled and lingered as the childish<lb>
voices reached them, and, looking through the screen<lb>
of roses, they caught glimpses of the happy little group<lb>
singing in the ruddy circle of that Christmas fire.</p>
<p>It was a very humble festival, but with these poor<lb>
guests came also Love and Charity, Innocence and Joy,&mdash;<lb>
the strong, sweet spirits who bless and beautify the<lb>
world; and though eclipsed by many more splendid celebrations,<lb>
I think the day was the better and the blither<lb>
for Mrs. Podgers' little party.</p>
<p>When it was all over, &mdash; the grateful farewells and<lb>
riotous cheers as the children were carried home, the<lb>
twilight raptures of Joe, and the long lullaby before he<lb>
could extinguish himself enough to go to sleep, the congratulations<lb>
and clearing up, &mdash; then Mr. 'Rusalem and<lb>
Mrs. Podgers sat down to tea. But no sooner were<lb>
they alone together than Mrs. P. fell into a curious flutter,<lb>
and did the oddest things. She gave Mr. 'Rusalem<lb>
warm water instead of tea, passed the slop-bowl when<lb>
he asked for the sugar-basin, burnt her fingers, laid her<lb>
handkerchief on the tray, and tried to put her fork in her<lb>
<pb n="166">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-183">

<figdesc>Page 166.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
pocket, and went on in such a way that Mr. 'Rusalem<lb>
began to fear the day had been too much for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're tired, mum,&rdquo; he said presently, hearing her<lb>
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; she answered briskly, opening the teapot<lb>
to add more water, but seemed to forget her purpose,<lb>
and sat looking into its steamy depths as if in search of<lb>
something. If it was courage, she certainly found it,<lb>
for all of a sudden she handed the mysterious paper to<lb>
Mr. 'Rusalem, saying solemnly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read that, and tell me if it's true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took it readily, put on his glasses, and bent to<lb>
examine it, but gave a start that caused the spectacles to<lb>
fly off his nose, as he exclaimed, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me, he said he'd burnt it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> true? Don't deny it, 'Rusalem; it's no<lb>
use, for I've caught you at last!&rdquo; and in her excitement<lb>
Mrs. Podgers slapped down the teapot-lid as if she had<lb>
got him inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, mum, he promised to burn it. He<lb>
made me write down the sums, and so on, to satisfy him<lb>
that I hadn't took more'n my share of the profits. It<lb>
was my own; and though he called me a fool he let me<lb>
do as I liked, but I never thought it would come up again<lb>
like this, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you didn't, for it was left in one of the old<lb>
ledgers we had down for the dears to sit on. I found it,<lb>
I read it, and I understood it in a minute. It was you<lb>
who helped the mill-people, and then hid behind Podgers<lb>
because you didn't want to be thanked. When he died,<lb>
and the teapot came, you saw how proud I was of it, &mdash;<lb>
how I took comfort in thinking he did the kind things;<lb>
<pb n="167">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-184">

<figdesc>Page 167.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and for my sake you never told the truth, not even last<lb>
night, when a word would have done so much. Oh,'<lb>
Rusalem, how could you deceive me all these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Mr. 'Rusalem had desired to answer he would have<lb>
had no chance; for Mrs. Podgers was too much in earnest<lb>
to let any one speak but herself, and hurried on, fearing<lb>
that her emotion would get the better of her before<lb>
she had had her say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was like you, but it wasn't right, for you've robbed<lb>
yourself of the love and honor that was your due; you've<lb>
let people praise Podgers when he didn't deserve it;<lb>
you've seen me take pride in this because I thought he'd<lb>
earned it; and you've only laughed at it all as if it was<lb>
a fine joke to do generous things and never take the<lb>
credit of 'em. Now I know what bank you've laid up<lb>
your hard earnings in, and what a blessed interest you'll<lb>
get by and by. Truly they who give to the poor lend to<lb>
the Lord, &mdash; and you don't need to have the good words<lb>
written on silver, for you keep 'em always in your<lb>
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Podgers stopped a minute for breath, and felt<lb>
that she was going very fast; for 'Rusalem sat looking<lb>
at her with so much humility, love, and longing in his<lb>
honest face, that she knew it would be all up with her<lb>
directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw how I grieved for Neddy, and gave me this<lb>
motherless boy to fill his place; you knew I wanted some<lb>
one to make the house seem like home again, and you<lb>
offered me the lovingest heart that ever was. You<lb>
found I wasn't satisfied to lead such a selfish life, and<lb>
you showed me how beautiful Charity could make it;<lb>
you taught me to find my duty waiting for me at my own<lb>
<pb n="168">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-185">

<figdesc>Page 168.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
door; and, putting by your own trouble, you've helped<lb>
to make this day the happiest Christmas of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it hadn't been for the teapot Mrs. Podgers would<lb>
have given out here; but her hand was still on it, and<lb>
something in the touch gave her steadiness for one more<lb>
burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved the little teapot for Podgers' sake; now I<lb>
love it a hundred times more for yours, because you've<lb>
brought its lesson home to me in a way I never can forget,<lb>
and have been my benefactor as well as theirs, who<lb>
shall soon know you as well as I do. 'Rusalem, there's<lb>
only one way in which I can thank you for all this, and<lb>
I do it with my whole heart. Last night you asked me<lb>
for something, and I thought I couldn't give it to you.<lb>
Now I'm sure I can, and if you still want it why &mdash; &rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Podgers never finished that sentence; for, with<lb>
an impetuosity surprising in one of his age and figure,<lb>
Mr. 'Rusalem sprang out of his chair and took her in his<lb>
arms, saying tenderly, in a voice almost inaudible,<lb>
between a conflicting choke and chuckle, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! my dear! God bless you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>DOCTOR FRANCK came in as I sat sewing up the<lb>
rents in an old shirt, that Tom might go tidily to his<lb>
grave. New shirts were needed for the living, and there<lb>
was no wife or mother to &ldquo;dress him handsome when<lb>
he went to meet the Lord,&rdquo; as one woman said, describing<lb>
the fine funeral she had pinched herself to give<lb>
her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dane, I'm in a quandary,&rdquo; began the Doctor,<lb>
with that expression of countenance which says as plainly<lb>
as words, &ldquo;I want to ask a favor, but I wish you'd save<lb>
me the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help you out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith! I don't like to propose it, but you certainly<lb>
can, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then name it, I beg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see a Reb has just been brought in crazy with<lb>
typhoid; a bad case every way; a drunken, rascally<lb>
little captain somebody took the trouble to capture, but<lb>
whom nobody wants to take the trouble to cure. The<lb>
wards are full, the ladies worked to death, and willing to<lb>
be for our own boys, but rather slow to risk their lives<lb>
for a Reb. Now, you've had the fever, you like queer<lb>
patients, your mate will see to your ward for a while, and<lb>
<pb n="170">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-187">

I will find you a good attendant. The fellow won't last<lb>
long, I fancy; but he can't die without some sort of care,<lb>
you know. I've put him in the fourth story of the west<lb>
wing, away from the rest. It is airy, quiet, and comfortable<lb>
there. I'm on that ward, and will do my best<lb>
for you in every way. Now, then, will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will, out of perversity, if not common<lb>
charity; for some of these people think that because I'm<lb>
an abolitionist I am also a heathen, and I should rather<lb>
like to show them that, though I cannot quite love my<lb>
enemies, I am willing to take care of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; I thought you'd go; and speaking of<lb>
abolition reminds me that you can have a contraband for<lb>
servant, if you like. It is that fine mulatto fellow who<lb>
was found burying his rebel master after the fight, and,<lb>
being badly cut over the head, our boys brought him<lb>
along. Will you have him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, &mdash; for I'll stand to my guns on that<lb>
point, as on the other; these black boys are far more<lb>
faithful and handy than some of the white scamps given<lb>
me to serve, instead of being served by. But is this man<lb>
well enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for that sort of work, and I think you'll like<lb>
him. He must have been a handsome fellow before he<lb>
got his face slashed; not much darker than myself; his<lb>
master's son, I dare say, and the white blood makes him<lb>
rather high and haughty about some things. He was in<lb>
a bad way when he came in, but vowed he'd die in the<lb>
street rather than turn in with the black fellows below;<lb>
so I put him up in the west wing, to be out of the way,<lb>
and he's seen to the captain all the morning. When can<lb>
you go up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as Tom is laid out, Skinner moved, Haywood<lb>
washed, Marble dressed, Charley rubbed, Downs<lb>
taken up, Upham laid down, and the whole forty fed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We both laughed, though the Doctor was on his way<lb>
to the dead-house and I held a shroud on my lap. But<lb>
in a hospital one learns that cheerfulness is one's salvation;<lb>
for, in an atmosphere of suffering and death, heaviness<lb>
of heart would soon paralyze usefulness of hand, if<lb>
the blessed gift of smiles had been denied us.</p>
<p>In an hour I took possession of my new charge, finding<lb>
a dissipated-looking boy of nineteen or twenty raving<lb>
in the solitary little room, with no one near him but<lb>
the contraband in the room adjoining. Feeling decidedly<lb>
more interest in the black man than in the white, yet<lb>
remembering the Doctor's hint of his being &ldquo;high and<lb>
haughty,&rdquo; I glanced furtively at him as I scattered<lb>
chloride of lime about the room to purify the air, and<lb>
settled matters to suit myself. I had seen many contrabands,<lb>
but never one so attractive as this. All colored<lb>
men are called &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; even if their heads are white;<lb>
this boy was five-and-twenty at least, strong-limbed and<lb>
manly, and had the look of one who never had been<lb>
cowed by abuse or worn with oppressive labor. He sat<lb>
on his bed doing nothing; no book, no pipe, no pen or<lb>
paper anywhere appeared, yet anything less indolent or<lb>
listless than his attitude and expression I never saw. Erect<lb>
he sat, with a hand on either knee, and eyes fixed on the<lb>
bare wall opposite, so rapt in some absorbing thought as<lb>
to be unconscious of my presence, though the door stood<lb>
wide open and my movements were by no means noiseless.<lb>
His face was half averted, but I instantly approved<lb>
the Doctor's taste, for the profile which I saw possessed<lb>
<pb n="172">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-189">

<figdesc>Page 172.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
all the attributes of comeliness belonging to his mixed<lb>
race. He was more quadroon than mulatto, with Saxon<lb>
features, Spanish complexion darkened by exposure,<lb>
color in lips and cheek, waving hair, and an eye full of<lb>
the passionate melancholy which in such men always<lb>
seems to utter a mute protest against the broken law<lb>
that doomed them at their birth. What could he be<lb>
thinking of? The sick boy cursed and raved, I rustled<lb>
to and fro, steps passed the door, bells rang, and the<lb>
steady rumble of army-wagons came up from the street,<lb>
still he never stirred. I had seen colored people in what<lb>
they call &ldquo;the black sulks,&rdquo; when, for days, they neither<lb>
smiled nor spoke, and scarcely ate. But this was something<lb>
more than that; for the man was not dully brooding<lb>
over some small grievance; he seemed to see an<lb>
all-absorbing fact or fancy recorded on the wall, which<lb>
was a blank to me. I wondered if it were some deep<lb>
wrong or sorrow, kept alive by memory and impotent<lb>
regret; if he mourned for the dead master to whom he<lb>
had been faithful to the end; or if the liberty now his<lb>
were robbed of half its sweetness by the knowledge that<lb>
some one near and dear to him still languished in the<lb>
hell from which he had escaped. My heart quite warmed<lb>
to him at that idea; I wanted to know and comfort him;<lb>
and, following the impulse of the moment, I went in and<lb>
touched him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>In an instant the man vanished and the slave appeared.<lb>
Freedom was too new a boon to have wrought its<lb>
blessed changes yet; and as he started up, with his<lb>
hand at his temple, and an obsequious &ldquo;Yes, Missis,&rdquo;<lb>
any romance that had gathered round him fled away,<lb>
leaving the saddest of all sad facts in living guise<lb>
<pb n="173">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-190">

<figdesc>Page 173.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
before me. Not only did the manhood seem to die out<lb>
of him, but the comeliness that first attracted me; for,<lb>
as he turned, I saw the ghastly wound that had laid open<lb>
cheek and forehead. Being partly healed, it was no<lb>
longer bandaged, but held together with strips of that<lb>
transparent plaster which I never see without a shiver,<lb>
and swift recollections of the scenes with which it is<lb>
associated in my mind. Part of his black hair had been<lb>
shorn away, and one eye was nearly closed; pain so distorted,<lb>
and the cruel sabre-cut so marred that portion of<lb>
his face, that, when I saw it, I felt as if a fine medal<lb>
had been suddenly reversed, showing me a far more<lb>
striking type of human suffering and wrong than Michael<lb>
Angelo's bronze prisoner. By one of those inexplicable<lb>
processes that often teach us how little we understand<lb>
ourselves, my purpose was suddenly changed; and, though<lb>
I went in to offer comfort as a friend, I merely gave an<lb>
order as a mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you open these windows? this man needs more<lb>
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed at once, and, as he slowly urged up the<lb>
unruly sash, the handsome profile was again turned<lb>
toward me, and again I was possessed by my first impression<lb>
so strongly that I involuntarily said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was fancy, but I thought that in the look<lb>
of mingled surprise and something like reproach which<lb>
he gave me, there was also a trace of grateful pleasure.<lb>
But he said, in that tone of spiritless humility these poor<lb>
souls learn so soon, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I isn't a white man, Missis, I'se a contraband.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="174">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-191">

<figdesc>Page 174.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it; but a contraband is a free man,<lb>
and I heartily congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He liked that; his face shone, he squared his shoulders,<lb>
lifted his head, and looked me full in the eye with a<lb>
brisk, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, Missis; anything more to do fer yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Franck thought you would help me with this<lb>
man as there are many patients and few nurses or<lb>
attendants. Have you had the fever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should have thought of that when they put<lb>
him here; wounds and fevers should not be together.<lb>
I'll try to get you moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a sudden laugh: if he had been a white<lb>
man, I should have called it scornful; as he was a few<lb>
shades darker than myself, I suppose it must be considered<lb>
an insolent, or at least an unmannerly one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don't matter, Missis. I'd rather be up here with<lb>
the fever than down with those niggers; and there isn't<lb>
no other place fer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor fellow! that was true. No ward in all the hospital<lb>
would take him in to lie side by side with the most<lb>
miserable white wreck there. Like the bat in &aelig;sop's<lb>
fable, he belonged to neither race; and the pride of one<lb>
and the helplessness of the other, kept him hovering<lb>
alone in the twilight a great sin has brought to overshadow<lb>
the whole land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall stay, then; for I would far rather have<lb>
you than my lazy Jack. But are you well and strong<lb>
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I'll do, Missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with a passive sort of acquiescence, &mdash; as if<lb>
<pb n="175">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-192">

<figdesc>Page 175.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
it did not much matter if he were not able, and no one<lb>
would particularly rejoice if he were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you will. By what name shall I<lb>
call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, Missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every woman has her pet whim; one of mine was<lb>
to teach the men self-respect by treating them respectfully.<lb>
Tom, Dick, and Harry would pass, when lads<lb>
rejoiced in those familiar abbreviations; but to address<lb>
men often old enough to be my father in that style did<lb>
not suit my old-fashioned ideas of propriety. This &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;<lb>
would never do; I should have found it as easy to call<lb>
the chaplain &ldquo;Gus&rdquo; as my tragical-looking contraband<lb>
by a title so strongly associated with the tail of a kite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your other name?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I like to<lb>
call my attendants by their last names rather than by<lb>
their first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'se got no other, Missis; we has our masters' names,<lb>
or do without. Mine's dead, and I won't have anything<lb>
of his 'bout me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll call you Robert, then, and you may fill this<lb>
pitcher for me, if you will be so kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went; but, through all the tame obedience years of<lb>
servitude had taught him, I could see that the proud<lb>
spirit his father gave him was not yet subdued, for the<lb>
look and gesture with which he repudiated his master's<lb>
name were a more effective declaration of independence<lb>
than any Fourth-of-July orator could have prepared.</p>
<p>We spent a curious week together. Robert seldom<lb>
left his room, except upon my errands; and I was a<lb>
prisoner all day, often all night, by the bedside of the<lb>
rebel. The fever burned itself rapidly away, for there<lb>
<pb n="176">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-193">

<figdesc>Page 176.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
seemed little vitality to feed it in the feeble frame of this<lb>
old young man, whose life had been none of the most<lb>
righteous, judging from the revelations made by his<lb>
unconscious lips; since more than once Robert authoritatively<lb>
silenced him, when my gentler hushings were of<lb>
no avail, and blasphemous wanderings or ribald campsongs<lb>
made my cheeks burn and Robert's face assume an<lb>
aspect of disgust. The captain was a gentleman in the<lb>
world's eye, but the contraband was the gentleman in<lb>
mine; &mdash; I was a fanatic, and that accounts for such<lb>
depravity of taste, I hope. I never asked Robert of<lb>
himself, feeling that somewhere there was a spot still too<lb>
sore to bear the lightest touch; but, from his language,<lb>
manner, and intelligence, I inferred that his color had<lb>
procured for him the few advantages within the reach of<lb>
a quick-witted, kindly-treated slave. Silent, grave, and<lb>
thoughtful, but most serviceable, was my contraband;<lb>
glad of the books I brought him, faithful in the performance<lb>
of the duties I assigned to him, grateful for the<lb>
friendliness I could not but feel and show toward him.<lb>
Often I longed to ask what purpose was so visibly altering<lb>
his aspect with such daily deepening gloom. But I<lb>
never dared, and no one else had either time or desire to<lb>
pry into the past of this specimen of one branch of the<lb>
chivalrous &ldquo;F. F. Vs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the seventh night, Dr. Franck suggested that it<lb>
would be well for some one, besides the general watchman<lb>
of the ward, to be with the captain, as it might be<lb>
his last. Although the greater part of the two preceding<lb>
nights had been spent there, of course I offered to remain, &mdash;<lb>
for there is a strange fascination in these scenes,<lb>
<pb n="177">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-194">

<figdesc>Page 177.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="12">
which renders one careless of fatigue and unconscious<lb>
of fear until the crisis is past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him water as long as he can drink, and if he<lb>
drops into a natural sleep, it may save him. I'll look in<lb>
at midnight, when some change will probably take place.<lb>
Nothing but sleep or a miracle will keep him now.<lb>
Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away went the Doctor; and, devouring a whole<lb>
mouthful of gapes, I lowered the lamp, wet the captain's<lb>
head, and sat down on a hard stool to begin my<lb>
watch. The captain lay with his hot, haggard face<lb>
turned toward me, filling the air with his poisonous<lb>
breath, and feebly muttering, with lips and tongue so<lb>
parched that the sanest speech would have been difficult<lb>
to understand. Robert was stretched on his bed in the<lb>
inner room, the door of which stood ajar, that a fresh<lb>
draught from his open window might carry the feverfumes<lb>
away through mine. I could just see a long, dark<lb>
figure, with the lighter outline of a face, and, having<lb>
little else to do just then, I fell to thinking of this curious<lb>
contraband, who evidently prized his freedom highly, yet<lb>
seemed in no haste to enjoy it. Dr. Franck had offered<lb>
to send him on to safer quarters, but he had said, &ldquo;No,<lb>
thank yer, sir, not yet,&rdquo; and then had gone away to fall<lb>
into one of those black moods of his, which began to<lb>
disturb me, because I had no power to lighten them. As<lb>
I sat listening to the clocks from the steeples all about<lb>
us, I amused myself with planning Robert's future, as I<lb>
often did my own, and had dealt out to him a generous<lb>
hand of trumps wherewith to play this game of life<lb>
which hitherto had gone so cruelly against him, when a<lb>
harsh choked voice called, &mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the captain, and some new terror seemed to<lb>
have gifted him with momentary strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here's Lucy,&rdquo; I answered, hoping that by following<lb>
the fancy I might quiet him, &mdash; for his face was<lb>
damp with the clammy moisture, and his frame shaken<lb>
with the nervous tremor that so often precedes death.<lb>
His dull eye fixed upon me, dilating with a bewildered<lb>
look of incredulity and wrath, till he broke out fiercely, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's a lie! she's dead, &mdash; and so's Bob, damn<lb>
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding speech a failure, I began to sing the quiet<lb>
tune that had often soothed delirium like this; but hardly<lb>
had the line, &mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;See gentle patience smile on pain,&rdquo;</p></q>
passed my lips, when he clutched me by the wrist, whispering<lb>
like one in mortal fear, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! she used to sing that way to Bob, but she<lb>
never would to me. I swore I'd whip the devil out of<lb>
her, and I did; but you know before she cut her throat<lb>
she said she'd haunt me, and there she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed behind me with an aspect of such pale<lb>
dismay, that I involuntarily glanced over my shoulder<lb>
and started as if I had seen a veritable ghost; for, peering<lb>
from the gloom of that inner room, I saw a shadowy<lb>
face, with dark hair all about it, and a glimpse of scarlet<lb>
at the throat. An instant showed me that it was only<lb>
Robert leaning from his bed's foot, wrapped in a gray<lb>
army-blanket, with his red shirt just visible above it,<lb>
and his long hair disordered by sleep. But what a<lb>
strange expression was on his face! The unmarred side<lb>
<pb n="179">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-196">

<figdesc>Page 179.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
was toward me, fixed and motionless as when I first<lb>
observed it, &mdash; less absorbed now, but more intent. His<lb>
eye glittered, his lips were apart like one who listened<lb>
with every sense, and his whole aspect reminded me of a<lb>
hound to which some wind had brought the scent of<lb>
unsuspected prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him, Robert? Does he mean you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laws, no, Missis; they all own half-a-dozen Bobs:<lb>
but hearin' my name woke me; that's all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke quite naturally, and lay down again, while<lb>
I returned to my charge, thinking that this paroxysm<lb>
was probably his last. But by another hour I perceived<lb>
a hopeful change; for the tremor had subsided, the cold<lb>
dew was gone, his breathing was more regular, and<lb>
Sleep, the healer, had descended to save or take him<lb>
gently away. Doctor Franck looked in at midnight,<lb>
bade me keep all cool and quiet, and not fail to administer<lb>
a certain draught as soon as the captain woke. Very<lb>
much relieved, I laid my head on my arms, uncomfortably<lb>
folded on the little table, and fancied I was about<lb>
to perform one of the feats which practice renders possible,&mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;sleeping with one eye open,&rdquo; as we say: a half-and-half<lb>
doze, for all senses sleep but that of hearing;<lb>
the faintest murmur, sigh, or motion will break it, and<lb>
give one back one's wits much brightened by the brief<lb>
permission to &ldquo;stand at ease.&rdquo; On this night the experiment<lb>
was a failure, for previous vigils, confinement, and<lb>
much care had rendered naps a dangerous indulgence.<lb>
Having roused half-a-dozen times in an hour to find all<lb>
quiet, I dropped my heavy head on my arms, and, drowsily<lb>
resolving to look up again in fifteen minutes, fell fast<lb>
asleep.</p>

</p>
<p>The striking of a deep-voiced clock awoke me with a<lb>
start. &ldquo;That is one,&rdquo; thought I; but, to my dismay, two<lb>
more strokes followed, and in remorseful haste I sprang<lb>
up to see what harm my long oblivion had done. A<lb>
strong hand put me back into my seat, and held me there.<lb>
It was Robert. The instant my eye met his my heart<lb>
began to beat, and all along my nerves tingled that electric<lb>
flash which foretells a danger that we cannot see.<lb>
He was very pale, his mouth grim, and both eyes full<lb>
of sombre fire; for even the wounded one was open<lb>
now, all the more sinister for the deep scar above and<lb>
below. But his touch was steady, his voice quiet, as he<lb>
said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit still, Missis; I won't hurt yer, nor scare yer, ef<lb>
I can help it, but yer waked too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go, Robert, &mdash; the captain is stirring, &mdash; I<lb>
must give him something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Missis, yer can't stir an inch. Look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding me with one hand, with the other he took up<lb>
the glass in which I had left the draught, and showed me<lb>
it was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he taken it?&rdquo; I asked, more and more bewildered.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flung it out o' winder, Missis; he'll have to do<lb>
without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, Robert? why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Kase I hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impossible to doubt the truth of that; his whole face<lb>
showed it, as he spoke through his set teeth, and launched<lb>
a fiery glance at the unconscious captain. I could only<lb>
hold my breath and stare blankly at him, wondering<lb>
what mad act was coming next. I suppose I shook and<lb>
<pb n="181">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-198">

<figdesc>Page 181.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
turned white, as women have a foolish habit of doing<lb>
when sudden danger daunts them; for Robert released<lb>
my arm, sat down upon the bedside just in front of me,<lb>
and said, with the ominous quietude that made me cold<lb>
to see and hear, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't yer be frightened, Missis; don't try to run<lb>
away, fer the door's locked and the key in my pocket;<lb>
don't yer cry out, fer yer'd have to scream a long while,<lb>
with my hand on yer mouth, 'efore yer was heard. Be<lb>
still, an' I'll tell yer what I'm gwine to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord help us! he has taken the fever in some sudden,<lb>
violent way, and is out of his head. I must humor<lb>
him till some one comes&rdquo;; in pursuance of which swift<lb>
determination, I tried to say, quite composedly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be still and hear you; but open the window.<lb>
Why did you shut it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry I can't do it, Missis; but yer'd jump out,<lb>
or call, if I did, an' I'm not ready yet. I shut it to make<lb>
yer sleep, an' heat would do it quicker'n anything else I<lb>
could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain moved, and feebly muttered &ldquo;Water!&rdquo;<lb>
Instinctively I rose to give it to him, but the heavy hand<lb>
came down upon my shoulder, and in the same decided<lb>
tone Robert said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water went with the physic; let him call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me go to him! he'll die without care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean he shall; &mdash; don't yer meddle, if yer please,<lb>
Missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his quiet tone and respectful manner, I saw<lb>
murder in his eyes, and turned faint with fear; yet the<lb>
fear excited me, and, hardly knowing what I did, I seized<lb>
the hands that had seized me, crying, &mdash;</p>
<pb n="182">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-199">

<figdesc>Page 182.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; you shall not kill him! It is base to hurt a<lb>
helpless man. Why do you hate him? He is not your<lb>
master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that answer from head to foot, and seemed to<lb>
fathom what was coming, with a prescience vague, but<lb>
unmistakable. One appeal was left to me, and I<lb>
made it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert, tell me what it means? Do not commit a<lb>
crime and make me accessory to it. There is a better<lb>
way of righting wrong than by violence; &mdash; let me help<lb>
you find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My voice trembled as I spoke, and I heard the frightened<lb>
flutter of my heart; so did he, and if any little act<lb>
of mine had ever won affection or respect from him, the<lb>
memory of it served me then. He looked down, and<lb>
seemed to put some question to himself; whatever it was,<lb>
the answer was in my favor, for when his eyes rose<lb>
again, they were gloomy, but not desperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> tell yer, Missis; but mind, this makes no<lb>
difference; the boy is mine. I'll give the Lord a chance<lb>
to take him fust: if He don't, I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! remember he is your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unwise speech; I felt it as it passed my lips, for a<lb>
black frown gathered on Robert's face, and his strong<lb>
hands closed with an ugly sort of grip. But he did not<lb>
touch the poor soul gasping there behind him, and seemed<lb>
content to let the slow suffocation of that stifling room<lb>
end his frail life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not like to forgit dat, Missis, when I've been<lb>
thinkin' of it all this week. I knew him when they fetched<lb>
him in, an' would 'a' done it long 'fore this, but I wanted<lb>
<pb n="183">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-200">

<figdesc>Page 183.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to ask where Lucy was; he knows, &mdash; he told to-night,&mdash;<lb>
an' now he's done for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Lucy?&rdquo; I asked hurriedly, intent on keeping<lb>
his mind busy with any thought but murder.</p>
<p>With one of the swift transitions of a mixed temperament<lb>
like this, at my question Robert's deep eyes filled,<lb>
the clenched hands were spread before his face, and all I<lb>
heard were the broken words, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, &mdash; he took her &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that instant every thought of fear was swallowed<lb>
up in burning indignation for the wrong, and a perfect<lb>
passion of pity for the desperate man so tempted to<lb>
avenge an injury for which there seemed no redress but<lb>
this. He was no longer slave or contraband, no drop of<lb>
black blood marred him in my sight, but an infinite compassion<lb>
yearned to save, to help, to comfort him. Words<lb>
seemed so powerless I offered none, only put my hand on<lb>
his poor head, wounded, homeless, bowed down with<lb>
grief for which I had no cure, and softly smoothed the<lb>
long, neglected hair, pitifully wondering the while where<lb>
was the wife who must have loved this tender-hearted<lb>
man so well.</p>
<p>The captain moaned again, and faintly whispered,<lb>
&ldquo;Air!&rdquo; but I never stirred. God forgive me! just then<lb>
I hated him as only a woman thinking of a sister<lb>
woman's wrong could hate. Robert looked up; his eyes<lb>
were dry again, his mouth grim. I saw that, said, &ldquo;Tell<lb>
me more,&rdquo; and he did; for sympathy is a gift the poorest<lb>
may give, the proudest stoop to receive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer see, Missis, his father, &mdash; I might say ours, ef<lb>
I warn't ashamed of both of 'em, &mdash; his father died two<lb>
years ago, an' left us all to Marster Ned, &mdash; that's him<lb>
<pb n="184">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-201">

<figdesc>Page 184.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
here, eighteen then. He always hated me, I looked so<lb>
like old Marster: he don't, &mdash; only the light skin an' hair.<lb>
Old Marster was kind to all of us, me 'specially, an'<lb>
bought Lucy off the next plantation down there in South<lb>
Car'lina, when he found I liked her. I married her, all<lb>
I could; it warn't much, but we was true to one another<lb>
till Marster Ned come home a year after an' made hell<lb>
fer both of us. He sent my old mother to be used up in<lb>
his rice-swamp in Georgy; he found me with my pretty<lb>
Lucy, an' though young Miss cried, an' I prayed to him<lb>
on my knees, an' Lucy run away, he wouldn't have no<lb>
mercy; he brought her back, an' &mdash; took her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what did you do?&rdquo; I cried, hot with helpless<lb>
pain and passion.</p>
<p>How the man's outraged heart sent the blood flaming<lb>
up into his face and deepened the tones of his impetuous<lb>
voice, as he stretched his arm across the bed, saying,<lb>
with a terribly expressive gesture, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I half murdered him, an' to-night I'll finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, &mdash; but go on now; what came next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave me a look that showed no white man could<lb>
have felt a deeper degradation in remembering and confessing<lb>
these last acts of brotherly oppression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They whipped me till I couldn't stand, an' then they<lb>
sold me further South. Yer thought I was a white man<lb>
once, &mdash; look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sudden wrench he tore the shirt from neck to<lb>
waist, and on his strong, brown shoulders showed me furrows<lb>
deeply ploughed, wounds which, though healed,<lb>
were ghastlier to me than any in that house. I could<lb>
not speak to him, and, with the pathetic dignity a great<lb>
<pb n="185">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-202">

<figdesc>Page 185.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
grief lends the humblest sufferer, he ended his brief<lb>
tragedy by simply saying, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's all, Missis. I'se never seen her since, an'<lb>
now I never shall in this world, &mdash; maybe not in t'other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Robert, why think her dead? The captain was<lb>
wandering when he said those sad things; perhaps he<lb>
will retract them when he is sane. Don't despair; don't<lb>
give up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Missis, I 'spect he's right; she was too proud to<lb>
bear that long. It's like her to kill herself. I told her<lb>
to, if there was no other way; an' she always minded<lb>
me, Lucy did. My poor girl! Oh, it warn't right! No,<lb>
by God, it warn't!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the memory of this bitter wrong, this double<lb>
bereavement, burned in his sore heart, the devil that<lb>
lurks in every strong man's blood leaped up; he put his<lb>
hand upon his brother's throat, and, watching the white<lb>
face before him, muttered low between his teeth, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm lettin' him go too easy; there's no pain in this;<lb>
we a'n't even yet. I wish he knew me. Marster Ned!<lb>
it's Bob; where's Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the captain's lips there came a long faint sigh,<lb>
and nothing but a flutter of the eyelids showed that he<lb>
still lived. A strange stillness filled the room as the<lb>
elder brother held the younger's life suspended in his<lb>
hand, while wavering between a dim hope and a deadly<lb>
hate. In the whirl of thoughts that went on in my brain,<lb>
only one was clear enough to act upon. I must prevent<lb>
murder, if I could, &mdash; but how? What could I do up<lb>
there alone, locked in with a dying man and a lunatic?&mdash;<lb>
for any mind yielded utterly to any unrighteous impulse<lb>
is mad while the impulse rules it. Strength I had<lb>
<pb n="186">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-203">

<figdesc>Page 186.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
not, nor much courage, neither time nor wit for stratagem,<lb>
and chance only could bring me help before it was<lb>
too late. But one weapon I possessed, &mdash; a tongue, &mdash;<lb>
often a woman's best defence; and sympathy, stronger<lb>
than fear, gave me power to use it. What I said Heaven<lb>
only knows, but surely Heaven helped me; words burned<lb>
on my lips, tears streamed from my eyes, and some good<lb>
angel prompted me to use the one name that had power<lb>
to arrest my hearer's hand and touch his heart. For at<lb>
that moment I heartily believed that Lucy lived, and this<lb>
earnest faith roused in him a like belief.</p>
<p>He listened with the lowering look of one in whom<lb>
brute instinct was sovereign for the time, &mdash; a look that<lb>
makes the noblest countenance base. He was but a<lb>
man, &mdash; a poor, untaught, outcast, outraged man. Life<lb>
had few joys for him; the world offered him no honors,<lb>
no success, no home, no love. What future would this<lb>
crime mar? and why should he deny himself that sweet,<lb>
yet bitter morsel called revenge? How many white<lb>
men, with all New England's freedom, culture, Christianity,<lb>
would not have felt as he felt then? Should I<lb>
have reproached him for a human anguish, a human<lb>
longing for redress, all now left him from the ruin of his<lb>
few poor hopes? Who had taught him that self-control,<lb>
self-sacrifice, are attributes that make men masters of<lb>
the earth, and lift them nearer heaven? Should I have<lb>
urged the beauty of forgiveness, the duty of devout submission?<lb>
He had no religion, for he was no saintly<lb>
&ldquo;Uncle Tom,&rdquo; and Slavery's black shadow seemed to<lb>
darken all the world to him, and shut out God. Should<lb>
I have warned him of penalties, of judgments, and the<lb>
potency of law? What did he know of justice, or the<lb>
<pb n="187">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-204">

<figdesc>Page 187.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
mercy that should temper that stern virtue, when every<lb>
law, human and divine, had been broken on his hearthstone?<lb>
Should I have tried to touch him by appeals to<lb>
filial duty, to brotherly love? How had his appeals been<lb>
answered? What memories had father and brother<lb>
stored up in his heart to plead for either now? No, &mdash;<lb>
all these influences, these associations, would have proved<lb>
worse than useless, had I been calm enough to try them.<lb>
I was not; but instinct, subtler than reason, showed me<lb>
the one safe clue by which to lead this troubled soul<lb>
from the labyrinth in which it groped and nearly fell.<lb>
When I paused, breathless, Robert turned to me, asking,<lb>
as if human assurances could strengthen his faith in<lb>
Divine Omnipotence, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe, if I let Marster Ned live, the Lord<lb>
will give me back my Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As surely as there is a Lord, you will find her here<lb>
or in the beautiful hereafter, where there is no black or<lb>
white, no master and no slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his hand from his brother's throat, lifted his<lb>
eyes from my face to the wintry sky beyond, as if<lb>
searching for that blessed country, happier even than the<lb>
happy North. Alas, it was the darkest hour before the<lb>
dawn! &mdash; there was no star above, no light below but<lb>
the pale glimmer of the lamp that showed the brother<lb>
who had made him desolate. Like a blind man who<lb>
believes there is a sun, yet cannot see it, he shook his<lb>
head, let his arms drop nervelessly upon his knees, and<lb>
sat there dumbly asking that question which many a soul<lb>
whose faith is firmer fixed than his has asked in hours<lb>
less dark than this, &mdash; &ldquo;Where is God?&rdquo; I saw the<lb>
tide had turned, and strenuously tried to keep this<lb>
<pb n="188">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-205">

<figdesc>Page 188.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
rudderless life-boat from slipping back into the whirlpool<lb>
wherein it had been so nearly lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have listened to you, Robert; now hear me, and<lb>
heed what I say, because my heart is full of pity for<lb>
you, full of hope for your future, and a desire to help<lb>
you now. I want you to go away from here, from the<lb>
temptation of this place, and the sad thoughts that haunt<lb>
it. You have conquered yourself once, and I honor you<lb>
for it, because, the harder the battle, the more glorious<lb>
the victory; but it is safer to put a greater distance<lb>
between you and this man. I will write you letters,<lb>
give you money, and send you to good old Massachusetts<lb>
to begin your new life a freeman, &mdash; yes, and a happy<lb>
man; for when the captain is himself again, I will learn<lb>
where Lucy is, and move heaven and earth to find and<lb>
give her back to you. Will you do this, Robert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, very slowly, the answer came; for the purpose<lb>
of a week, perhaps a year, was hard to relinquish<lb>
in an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Missis, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Now you are the man I thought you, and<lb>
I'll work for you with all my heart. You need sleep,<lb>
my poor fellow; go, and try to forget. The captain is<lb>
alive, and as yet you are spared that sin. No, don't look<lb>
there; I'll care for him. Come, Robert, for Lucy's<lb>
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank Heaven for the immortality of love! for when<lb>
all other means of salvation failed, a spark of this vital<lb>
fire softened the man's iron will, until a woman's hand<lb>
could bend it. He let me take from him the key, let<lb>
me draw him gently away, and lead him to the solitude<lb>
which now was the most healing balm I could bestow.<lb>
<pb n="189">

</eaffig>
Once in his little room, he fell down on his bed and lay<lb>
there, as if spent with the sharpest conflict of his life.<lb>
I slipped the bolt across his door, and unlocked my own,<lb>
flung up the window, steadied myself with a breath of<lb>
air, then rushed to Doctor Franck. He came; and till<lb>
dawn we worked together, saving one brother's life, and<lb>
taking earnest thought how best to secure the other's<lb>
liberty. When the sun came up as blithely as if it shone<lb>
only upon happy homes, the Doctor went to Robert.<lb>
For an hour I heard the murmur of their voices; once<lb>
I caught the sound of heavy sobs, and for a time a<lb>
reverent hush, as if in the silence that good man were<lb>
ministering to soul as well as body. When he departed<lb>
he took Robert with him, pausing to tell me he should<lb>
get him off as soon as possible, but not before we met<lb>
again.</p>
<p>Nothing more was seen of them all day; another<lb>
surgeon came to see the captain, and another attendant<lb>
came to fill the empty place. I tried to rest, but could<lb>
not, with the thought of poor Lucy tugging at my heart,<lb>
and was soon back at my post again, anxiously hoping<lb>
that my contraband had not been too hastily spirited<lb>
away. Just as night fell there came a tap, and, opening,<lb>
I saw Robert literally &ldquo;clothed, and in his right mind.&rdquo;<lb>
The Doctor had replaced the ragged suit with tidy garments,<lb>
and no trace of that tempestuous night remained<lb>
but deeper lines upon the forehead, and the docile look<lb>
of a repentant child. He did not cross the threshold,<lb>
did not offer me his hand, &mdash; only took off his cap,<lb>
saying, with a traitorous falter in his voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless yer, Missis! I'm gwine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put out both my hands, and held his fast.</p>
<pb n="190">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-207">

<figdesc>Page 190.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Robert! Keep up good heart, and when<lb>
I come home to Massachusetts we'll meet in a happier<lb>
place than this. Are you quite ready, quite comfortable<lb>
for your journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Missis, yes; the Doctor's fixed everything; I'se<lb>
gwine with a friend of his; my papers are all right, an'<lb>
I'm as happy as I can be till I find&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>He stopped there; then went on, with a glance into<lb>
the room, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm glad I didn't do it, an' I thank yer, Missis, fer<lb>
hinderin' me, &mdash; thank yer hearty; but I'm afraid I hate<lb>
him jest the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he did; and so did I; for these faulty hearts<lb>
of ours cannot turn perfect in a night, but need frost and<lb>
fire, wind and rain, to ripen and make them ready for the<lb>
great harvest-home. Wishing to divert his mind, I put my<lb>
poor mite into his hand, and, remembering the magic of<lb>
a certain little book, I gave him mine, on whose dark<lb>
cover whitely shone the Virgin Mother and the Child,<lb>
the grand history of whose life the book contained. The<lb>
money went into Robert's pocket with a grateful murmur,<lb>
the book into his bosom, with a long look and a tremulous&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw <hi rend="italics">my</hi> baby, Missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I broke down then; and though my eyes were too dim<lb>
to see, I felt the touch of lips upon my hands, heard the<lb>
sound of departing feet, and knew my contraband was<lb>
gone.</p>
<p>When one feels an intense dislike, the less one says<lb>
about the subject of it the better; therefore I shall<lb>
merely record that the captain lived, &mdash; in time was<lb>
exchanged; and that, whoever the other party was, I<lb>

am convinced the Government got the best of the bargain.<lb>
But long before this occurred, I had fulfilled my<lb>
promise to Robert; for as soon as my patient recovered<lb>
strength of memory enough to make his answer trustworthy,<lb>
I asked, without any circumlocution, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Fairfax, where is Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And too feeble to be angry, surprised, or insincere, he<lb>
straightway answered, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead, Miss Dane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she killed herself when you sold Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the devil did you know that?&rdquo; he muttered,<lb>
with an expression half-remorseful, half-amazed; but I<lb>
was satisfied, and said no more.</p>
<p>Of course this went to Robert, waiting far away there<lb>
in a lonely home, &mdash; waiting, working, hoping for his<lb>
Lucy. It almost broke my heart to do it; but delay<lb>
was weak, deceit was wicked; so I sent the heavy<lb>
tidings, and very soon the answer came, &mdash; only three<lb>
lines; but I felt that the sustaining power of the man's<lb>
life was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tort I'd never see her any more; I 'm glad to know<lb>
she's out of trouble. I thank yer, Missis; an' if they let<lb>
us, I'll fight fer yer till I'm killed, which I hope will be'<lb>
fore long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months later he had his wish, and kept his word.</p>
<p>Every one knows the story of the attack on Fort<lb>
Wagner; but we should not tire yet of recalling how<lb>
our Fifty-Fourth, spent with three sleepless nights, a<lb>
day's fast, and a march under the July sun, stormed the<lb>
fort as night fell, facing death in many shapes, following<lb>
their brave leaders through a fiery rain of shot and shell,<lb>
fighting valiantly for &ldquo;God and Governor Andrew,&rdquo; &mdash;<lb>
<pb n="192">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-209">

</eaffig>
how the regiment that went into action seven hundred<lb>
strong, came out having had nearly half its number<lb>
captured, killed, or wounded, leaving their young commander<lb>
to be buried, like a chief of earlier times, with<lb>
his body-guard around him, faithful to the death. Surely,<lb>
the insult turns to honor, and the wide grave needs no<lb>
monument but the heroism that consecrates it in our<lb>
sight; surely, the hearts that held him nearest, see<lb>
through their tears a noble victory in the seeming sad<lb>
defeat; and surely, God's benediction was bestowed,<lb>
when this loyal soul answered, as Death called the roll,<lb>
&ldquo;Lord, here am I, with the brothers Thou hast given<lb>
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The future must show how well that fight was fought;<lb>
for though Fort Wagner once defied us, public prejudice<lb>
is down; and through the cannon-smoke of that black<lb>
night, the manhood of the colored race shines before<lb>
many eyes that would not see, rings in many ears that<lb>
would not hear, wins many hearts that would not hitherto<lb>
believe.</p>
<p>When the news came that we were needed, there was<lb>
none so glad as I to leave teaching contrabands, the new<lb>
work I had taken up, and go to nurse &ldquo;our boys,&rdquo; as<lb>
my dusky flock so proudly called the wounded of the<lb>
Fifty-Fourth. Feeling more satisfaction, as I assumed<lb>
my big apron and turned up my cuffs, than if dressing<lb>
for the President's levee, I fell to work in Hospital No. 10<lb>
at Beaufort. The scene was most familiar, and yet<lb>
strange; for only dark faces looked up at me from the<lb>
pallets so thickly laid along the floor, and I missed the<lb>
sharp accent of my Yankee boys in the slower, softer<lb>
voices calling cheerily to one another, or answering my<lb>

questions with a stout, &ldquo;We'll never give it up, Missis,<lb>
till the last Reb's dead,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;If our people's free, we<lb>
can afford to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing from bed to bed, intent on making one pair of<lb>
hands do the work of three, at least, I gradually washed,<lb>
fed, and bandaged my way down the long line of sable<lb>
heroes, and coming to the very last, found that he was<lb>
my contraband. So old, so worn, so deathly weak and<lb>
wan, I never should have known him but for the deep<lb>
scar on his cheek. That side lay uppermost, and caught<lb>
my eye at once; but even then I doubted, such an awful<lb>
change had come upon him, when, turning to the ticket<lb>
just above his head, I saw the name, &ldquo;Robert Dane.&rdquo;<lb>
That both assured and touched me, for, remembering<lb>
that he had no name, I knew that he had taken mine.<lb>
I longed for him to speak to me, to tell how he had fared<lb>
since I lost sight of him, and let me perform some little<lb>
service for him in return for many he had done for me;<lb>
but he seemed asleep; and as I stood re-living that<lb>
strange night again, a bright lad, who lay next him<lb>
softly waving an old fan across both beds, looked up and<lb>
said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you know him, Missis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as any one was able to, Missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say `was,' as if the man were dead<lb>
and gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s'pose because I know he'll have to go. He's got<lb>
a bad jab in the breast, an' is bleedin' inside, the Doctor<lb>
says. He don't suffer any, only gets weaker 'n' weaker<lb>
every minute. I've been fannin' him this long while,<lb>
<pb n="194">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-211">

<figdesc>Page 194.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
an' he's talked a little; but he don't know me now, so<lb>
he's most gone, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was so much sorrow and affection in the boy's<lb>
face, that I remembered something, and asked, with<lb>
redoubled interest, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the one that brought him off? I was told<lb>
about a boy who nearly lost his life in saving that of his<lb>
mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dare say the young fellow blushed, as any modest<lb>
lad might have done; I could not see it, but I heard the<lb>
chuckle of satisfaction that escaped him, as he glanced<lb>
from his shattered arm and bandaged side to the pale<lb>
figure opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, Missis, that's nothin'; we boys always stan'<lb>
by one another, an' I warn't goin' to leave him to be<lb>
tormented any more by them cussed Rebs. He's been a<lb>
slave once, though he don't look half so much like it as<lb>
me, an' I was born in Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not; for the speaker was as black as the ace<lb>
of spades, &mdash; being a sturdy specimen, the knave of clubs<lb>
would perhaps be a fitter representative, &mdash; but the dark<lb>
freeman looked at the white slave with the pitiful, yet<lb>
puzzled expression I have so often seen on the faces of<lb>
our wisest men, when this tangled question of Slavery<lb>
presented itself, asking to be cut or patiently undone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you know of this man; for, even if<lb>
he were awake, he is too weak to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw him till I joined the regiment, an' no<lb>
one 'peared to have got much out of him. He was a<lb>
shut-up sort of feller, an' didn't seem to care for anything<lb>
but gettin' at the Rebs. Some say he was the fust man<lb>
of us that enlisted; I know he fretted till we were off,<lb>
<pb n="195">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-212">

<figdesc>Page 195.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
an' when we pitched into old Wagner, he fought like the<lb>
devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you with him when he was wounded? How<lb>
was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Missis. There was somethin' queer about it;<lb>
for he 'peared to know the chap that killed him, an' the<lb>
chap knew him. I don't dare to ask, but I rather guess<lb>
one owned the other some time; for, when they clinched,<lb>
the chap sung out, `Bob!' an' Dane, `Marster Ned!'&mdash;<lb>
then they went at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat down suddenly, for the old anger and compassion<lb>
struggled in my heart, and I both longed and feared to<lb>
hear what was to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, when the Colonel, &mdash; Lord keep an' send<lb>
him back to us! &mdash; it a'n't certain yet, you know, Missis,<lb>
though it's two days ago we lost him, &mdash; well, when the<lb>
Colonel shouted, `Rush on, boys, rush on!' Dane tore<lb>
away as if he was goin' to take the fort alone; I was<lb>
next him, an' kept close as we went through the ditch an'<lb>
up the wall. Hi! warn't that a rusher!&rdquo; and the boy<lb>
flung up his well arm with a whoop, as if the mere memory<lb>
of that stirring moment came over him in a gust of<lb>
irrepressible excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you afraid?&rdquo; I said, asking the question women<lb>
often put, and receiving the answer they seldom fail to<lb>
get.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Missis!&rdquo; &mdash; emphasis on the &ldquo;Missis&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I<lb>
never thought of anything but the damn' Rebs, that scalp,<lb>
slash, an' cut our ears off, when they git us. I was<lb>
bound to let daylight into one of 'em at least, an' I did.<lb>
Hope he liked it!&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is evident that you did. Now go on about Robert,<lb>
for I should be at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was one of the fust up; I was just behind, an'<lb>
though the whole thing happened in a minute, I remember<lb>
how it was, for all I was yellin' an' knockin' round<lb>
like mad. Just where we were, some sort of an officer<lb>
was wavin' his sword an' cheerin' on his men; Dane<lb>
saw him by a big flash that come by; he flung away his<lb>
gun, give a leap, an' went at that feller as if he was Jeff,<lb>
Beauregard, an' Lee, all in one. I scrabbled after as<lb>
quick as I could, but was only up in time to see him git<lb>
the sword straight through him an' drop into the ditch.<lb>
You needn't ask what I did next, Missis, for I don't<lb>
quite know myself; all I'm clear about is, that I managed<lb>
somehow to pitch that Reb into the fort as dead as<lb>
Moses, git hold of Dane, an' bring him off. Poor old<lb>
feller! we said we went in to live or die; he said he<lb>
went in to die, an' he's done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been intently watching the excited speaker; but<lb>
as he regretfully added those last words I turned again,<lb>
and Robert's eyes met mine, &mdash; those melancholy eyes,<lb>
so full of an intelligence that proved he had heard,<lb>
remembered, and reflected with that preternatural power<lb>
which often outlives all other faculties. He knew me,<lb>
yet gave no greeting; was glad to see a woman's face,<lb>
yet had no smile wherewith to welcome it; felt that he<lb>
was dying, yet uttered no farewell. He was too far<lb>
across the river to return or linger now; departing<lb>
thought, strength, breath, were spent in one grateful<lb>
look, one murmur of submission to the last pang he<lb>
could ever feel. His lips moved, and, bending to them,<lb>

a whisper chilled my cheek, as it shaped the broken<lb>
words, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd 'a' done it, &mdash; but it's better so, &mdash; I'm satisfied.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>Ah! well he might be, &mdash; for, as he turned his face<lb>
from the shadow of the life that was, the sunshine of the<lb>
life to be touched it with a beautiful content, and in the<lb>
drawing of a breath my contraband found wife and<lb>
home, eternal liberty and God.</p>

</p>
<p>DO you mean it, Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You set a high price on your love; I cannot pay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came a little nearer, this beautiful woman, whom<lb>
the young man loved with all the ardor of a first affection,<lb>
she laid her hand upon his arm, and looked up in<lb>
his face, her own wearing its most persuasive aspect; for<lb>
tenderness seemed to have conquered pride, and will was<lb>
concealed under a winning softness which made her<lb>
doubly dangerous, as she said, in the slow, sweet voice<lb>
that betrayed her Southern birth, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember what you ask,&mdash;what I offer; then tell me<lb>
which demands the highest price for love. You would<lb>
have me give up friends, fortune, home, all the opinions,<lb>
prejudices, and beliefs of birth and education, all the<lb>
hopes and purposes of years, for your sake. I ask nothing<lb>
of you but the relinquishment of a mistaken duty;<lb>
I offer you all I possess: a life of luxury and power, and,&mdash;<lb>
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused there, with a gesture of proud humility, as<lb>
if she would ignore the fact, yet could not quite conceal<lb>
the consciousness, that she had much to bestow upon the<lb>
lover who had far less to offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rose, you tempt me terribly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;not<lb>
<pb n="199">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-216">

<figdesc>Page 199.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with your possessions or a life of luxury, but with yourself,<lb>
because I love you more than a thousand fortunes or<lb>
a century of ease and power. Yet, dear as you are to<lb>
me, and barren as the world will be without you, I dare<lb>
not turn traitor even for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you would have me do it for yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: treachery to the wrong is allegiance to the<lb>
right, and I only ask you to love your country better than<lb>
yourself, as I try to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shall say which is right and which wrong? I<lb>
am tired of the words. I want to forget the ills I cannot<lb>
cure, and enjoy life while I may. Youth was made for<lb>
happiness; why waste it in a quarrel which time alone can<lb>
end? Robert, I do not ask you to turn traitor. I do<lb>
not care what you believe. I only ask you to stay with<lb>
me, now that I have owned how much you are to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows I wish I could, Rose; but idleness is<lb>
treason in times like these. What right have I to think<lb>
of my own happiness when my country needs me? It is<lb>
like deserting my old mother in extremest peril to stand<lb>
idle now; and when you tempt me to forget this, I must<lb>
deny your prayer, because it is the only one I cannot<lb>
grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Robert, you are little to the rest of the world,<lb>
and everything to me. Your country does not need you<lb>
half so much as I, &mdash; `a stranger in a strange land'; for,<lb>
in a great struggle like this, what can one man do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His duty, Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pleaded eloquently with voice, and eyes, and<lb>
hands; but something in the sad gravity of the young<lb>
man's face was a keener reproach than his words. She<lb>
felt that she could not win him so, and, with a swift and<lb>
<pb n="200">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-217">

<figdesc>Page 200.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
subtle change of countenance and manner, she put him<lb>
from her, saying reproachfully, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do yours, and make some reparation for the<lb>
peace of mind you have destroyed. I have a right to ask<lb>
this. I came here as to a refuge, hoping to live unknown<lb>
till the storm was over. Why did you find me out, protect<lb>
me by your influence, lighten my exile by your society,<lb>
and, under the guise of friendship, teach me to<lb>
love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Stirling watched her with lover's eyes, listened<lb>
with lover's ears, and answered like a lover, finding her<lb>
the fairer and dearer for the growing fear that a hard<lb>
test was in store for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found you out, because your beauty would not be<lb>
concealed; I protected you, because you were a woman,<lb>
and alone; I gave you friendship, because I wished to<lb>
prove that we of the North hold sacred the faith our<lb>
enemies place in us by sending to our keeping the treasure<lb>
they most value; and, Rose, I loved you because I could<lb>
not help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled then, and the color deepened beautifully in<lb>
the half-averted face, but she did not speak, and Robert<lb>
took heart from the sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant to tell you this, fearing what has now<lb>
happened, and I resolved to go away. But, coming here<lb>
to say good-by, your grief melted my resolve, and I told<lb>
you what I could no longer hide. Have I been ungencrous<lb>
and unjust? If you believe so, tell me what reparation<lb>
I can make, and, if it is anything an honest man<lb>
may do, I will do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew that, was glad to know it; yet, with the<lb>
exacting affection of a selfish woman, she felt a jealous<lb>
<pb n="201">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-218">

<figdesc>Page 201.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fear that she loved more than she was beloved, and<lb>
must assure herself by some trial that she was all in<lb>
all to her young lover. He waited for her answer with<lb>
such keen anxiety, such wistful tenderness, that she felt<lb>
confident of success; and, yielding to the love of power<lb>
so strong within her, she could not resist the desire of<lb>
exercising it over this new subject, finding her excuse in<lb>
the fond yet wayward wish to keep from danger that<lb>
which was now so dear to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lost enough by this costly war: I will lose no<lb>
more,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is easier to part at once than later,<lb>
when time has more endeared us to each other. Choose<lb>
between the country which you love and the woman who<lb>
loves you, and by that choice we will both abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose, this is cruel, this is hard! Let me choose both,<lb>
and be the better man for that double service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible. No one can serve two mistresses.<lb>
I will have all or nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke she gently, but decidedly, freed herself<lb>
from his detaining hold, and stood away from him, as if<lb>
to prove both her strength and her sincerity. The act<lb>
changed the words of separation trembling on Robert's<lb>
lips to words of entreaty; for, though his upright nature<lb>
owned the hard duty, his heart clung to its idol, feeling<lb>
that it must be wrenched away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a little, Rose. Give me time to think. Let<lb>
me prove that I am no coward; then I will serve you,<lb>
and you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Robert; if you truly loved me, you would be<lb>
eager and glad to make any sacrifice for me. I would<lb>
willingly make many for you; but this one I cannot,<lb>
because it robs me of you in a double sense. If you<lb>

</eaffig>
fall, I lose you; if you come back alive, I lose you no<lb>
less, for how can I accept a hand reddened with the<lb>
blood of those I love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no answer, and stood silent. She saw that this<lb>
moment of keen suffering and conflicting passions was<lb>
the turning-point in the young man's life, yet, nothing<lb>
doubting her power, she hardened herself to his pain that<lb>
she might gain her point now and repay his submission<lb>
by greater affection hereafter. Her voice broke the brief<lb>
silence, steady, sweet, and sad:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you have chosen; I submit. But go at<lb>
once, while I can part as I should; and remember, we<lb>
must never meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had dropped his face into his hands, struggling<lb>
dumbly with honest conscience and rebellious heart.<lb>
Standing so, he felt a light touch on his bent head, heard<lb>
the sound of a departing step, and looked up to see Rose<lb>
passing from his sight, perhaps forever. An exclamation<lb>
of love and longing broke from his lips; at the sound she<lb>
paused, and, turning, let him see that her face was bathed<lb>
in tears. At that sight duty seemed doubly stern and<lb>
cruel, the sacrifice of integrity grew an easy thing, and<lb>
separation an impossibility. The tender eyes were on<lb>
him, the imploring hands outstretched to him, and the<lb>
beloved voice cried, brokenly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robert, stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke out defiantly, as if to silence the inward<lb>
monitor that would not yield consent; he offered his hand<lb>
to seal the promise, and took one step toward the fair<lb>
temptation, &mdash; no more; for, at the instant, up from<lb>
<pb n="203">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-220">

<figdesc>Page 203.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
below rose a voice, clear and mellow as a silver horn,<lb>
singing, &mdash;</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;He has sounded forth the trumpet</l>
<l rend="indent">That shall never call retreat;</l>
<l>He is sifting out the hearts of men</l>
<l rend="indent">Before his judgment-seat;</l>
<l>Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer him;</l>
<l rend="indent">Be jubilant, my feet!</l>
<l rend="indent">For God is marching on.&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
<p>The song broke the troubled silence with a martial<lb>
ring that, to one listener, sounded like a bugle-call,<lb>
banishing with its magic breath the weakness that had<lb>
nearly made a recreant of him; for the opportune outbreak<lb>
of the familiar voice, the memories it woke, the<lb>
nobler spirit it recalled, all made that sweet and stirring<lb>
strain the young man's salvation. Both stood motionless,<lb>
and so still that every word came clearly through<lb>
the sunny hush that filled the room. Rose's face grew<lb>
anxious, a flash of anger dried the tears, and the expression<lb>
which had been so tender changed to one of<lb>
petulant annoyance. But Robert did not see it; he no<lb>
longer watched her; he had turned towards the open<lb>
window, and was looking far away into the distance,<lb>
where seemed to lie the future this moment was to make<lb>
or mar, while his whole aspect grew calm and steady,<lb>
as if with the sense of self-control came the power of<lb>
self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>As the song ended, he turned, gave one parting look<lb>
at the woman whom he loved, said, &ldquo;I have chosen!<lb>
Rose, good-by,&rdquo; and was gone.</p>
<p>Out into the beautiful spring world he went, blind to<lb>
its beauty, deaf to its music, unconscious of its peace.<lb>

Before him went the blithe singer, &mdash; a young man, with<lb>
uncovered head, brown hair blowing in the wind, thoughtful<lb>
eyes bent on the ground, and lips still softly singing,<lb>
as he walked. This brother, always just and gentle,<lb>
always ready with sympathy and counsel, now seemed<lb>
doubly dear to the sore heart of Robert, as, hurrying to<lb>
him, he grasped his arm as a drowning man might clutch<lb>
at sudden help; for, though the victory seemed won, he<lb>
dared not trust himself alone, with that great longing<lb>
tugging at his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Rob! what is it?&rdquo; asked his brother, pausing<lb>
to wonder at the change which had befallen him since<lb>
they parted but a little while ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask no questions, Richard; but sing on, sing on,<lb>
and, if you love me, keep me fast till we get home,&rdquo;<lb>
answered Robert, excitedly.</p>
<p>Something in his manner, and the glance he cast over<lb>
his shoulder, seemed to enlighten his brother. Richard's<lb>
face darkened ominously for a moment, then softened<lb>
with sincerest pity as he drew the hand closer through<lb>
his arm, and answered, with an almost womanly compassion, &mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lad, I knew it would be so! but I had no fear<lb>
that you would become a slave to that beautiful tyrant.<lb>
The bitter draught is often more wholesome than the<lb>
sweet, and you are wise to <hi rend="italics">let</hi> her go before it is too late.<lb>
Tell me your trouble, Rob, and let me help you bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now! not here! Sing, Rick, if you would not<lb>
have me break away and go back to her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brother obeyed him, not with the war-song, but<lb>
with the simpler air their mother's voice had made a<lb>
lullaby, beloved by them as babies, boys, and men.<lb>

Now, as of old, it soothed and comforted; and, though<lb>
poor Robert turned his face away and let his brother<lb>
lead him where he would, the first sharpness of his pain<lb>
was eased by a recollection born of the song; for he<lb>
remembered that though one woman had failed him,<lb>
there still remained another whose faithful love would<lb>
know no shadow of a change.</p>
<p>As they came into the familiar room, where every<lb>
object spoke of the dear household league lasting unbroken<lb>
for so many years, a softer mood replaced the<lb>
pain and passion that had struggled in the lover's heart;<lb>
and, throwing himself into the ancient chair where so<lb>
many boyish griefs had been consoled, he laid his head<lb>
upon his arms, and forgot his manhood for a little while.<lb>
Richard stood beside him, with a kind hand on his<lb>
shoulder, to assure him of a sympathy too deep and wise<lb>
for words, till the fitting moment should appear. It<lb>
soon came; and when the younger brother had made<lb>
known his trouble, and the elder given what cheer he<lb>
could, he tried to lead Robert's thoughts to other things,<lb>
that he might forget disappointment in action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing need detain you now, Rob,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for<lb>
the loss of one hope opens the way to the attainment of<lb>
another. You shall enlist at once, and march away to<lb>
fight the good fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Rick? We have both longed to go, but<lb>
could not decide which it should be. Why should not<lb>
you march away, and let me stay with mother till my<lb>
turn comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need I tell you why? We did delay at first, because<lb>
we could not choose which should stay with the dear old<lb>
lady who has only us left now. But lately you have<lb>
<pb n="206">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-223">

<figdesc>Page 206.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
lingered because of Rose, and I because I would not<lb>
leave you till I knew how you fared. That is all over<lb>
now; and surely it is best for you to put States between<lb>
you, and let absence teach you to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, and I am a weak fool to dream of<lb>
staying. I ought to go; but the spirit that once would<lb>
have made the duty easy has deserted me. Richard, I<lb>
have lost faith in myself, and am afraid to go alone.<lb>
Come with me, to comfort and keep me steady, as you<lb>
have done all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could. Never doubt nor despond, no; but<lb>
remember that <hi rend="italics">we</hi> trust you, <hi rend="italics">we</hi> expect great things of<lb>
you, and are sure you never will disgrace the name father<lb>
gave into our keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll do my best, Rick; but I shall need you more<lb>
than ever: and if mother only knew how it is with me,<lb>
I think she would say, `Go.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother does say it, heartily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both started, and turned to see their mother watching<lb>
them with an untroubled face. A right noble old woman,<lb>
carrying her sixty years gracefully and well, &mdash; for her<lb>
tall figure was unbent; below the gray hair shone eyes<lb>
clear as any girl's, and her voice had a cheery ring to it<lb>
that roused energy and hope in those who heard it; while<lb>
the benignant power of her glance, the motherly compassion<lb>
of her touch, brought confirmation to the wavering<lb>
resolve and comfort to the wounded heart.</p>
<p>With the filial instinct which outlives childhood, Robert<lb>
leaned against her as she drew his head to the bosom that<lb>
could always give it rest, and told his sorrow in one<lb>
broken exclamation, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, I loved her so!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="207">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-224">

<figdesc>Page 207.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, dear: I saw it, and I warned you. But<lb>
you thought me unjust. I desired to be proved so, and<lb>
it has ended here. You have loved like a man, have<lb>
withstood temptation like a man; now bear your loss like<lb>
one, and do not mar your sacrifice to principle by any<lb>
vain regrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, mother, all the courage, energy, and strength<lb>
seem to have gone out of me, and I am tired of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Rob; wait a little, and you will find that<lb>
life has gained a new significance. This trouble will<lb>
change the boy into a man, braver and better for the<lb>
past, because, if I know my son, he will never let his life<lb>
be thwarted by a selfish woman's folly or caprice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke proudly, and Robert lifted his head with an<lb>
air as proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. I will not. But you must let me go!<lb>
I cannot answer for myself if I stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall go, and Rick with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mother, can we, &mdash; ought we, &mdash; to leave you<lb>
alone?&rdquo; began Richard, longing, yet loath, to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my boys, you neither can nor will; for I go<lb>
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With us?&rdquo; cried both brothers, in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lads, that I will!&rdquo; she answered, heartily.<lb>
&ldquo;There is work for the old hands as well as for the<lb>
young; and while my boys fight for me, I will both nurse<lb>
and pray for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mother, the distance and danger, the hardships<lb>
and horrors of such a life, will be too much for you. Let<lb>
one of us stay, and keep you safely here at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while you are needed elsewhere. Other mothers<lb>
give their boys; why should not I give mine? Other<lb>
<pb n="208">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-225">

<figdesc>Page 208.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
women endure the hardships and horrors of camps and<lb>
hospitals; can I not do as much? You offer your young<lb>
lives; surely I may offer the remains of mine. Say no<lb>
more: I must enlist with my boys. I could never sit<lb>
with folded hands at home, tormenting myself with fears<lb>
for you, although God knows I send you willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have been a Roman matron, mother,<lb>
with many sons to give for your country and few tears<lb>
for yourself,&rdquo; said Richard, watching the fire of her<lb>
glance, and listening to the steady voice that talked so<lb>
cheerfully of danger and of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Rob, the ancient legends preserved the brave<lb>
words of the Roman matrons, but they left no record of<lb>
the Roman mothers' tears, because they kept them for<lb>
the bitter hours that came when the sacrifices had been<lb>
made.&rdquo; And, as she spoke, two great drops rolled down<lb>
to glitter upon Robert's hair.</p>
<p>For a moment no one stirred, as the three looked their<lb>
new future in the face, and, seeing all its perils, owned<lb>
its wisdom, accepted its duties, and stood ready to fulfil<lb>
them to the last.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stirling spoke first:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sons, these are times to try the metal of all souls;<lb>
and if we would have ours ring clear, we must follow<lb>
with devout obedience the strong convictions that prompt<lb>
and lead us to the right. Go, lads, and do your best,<lb>
remembering that mother follows you, to rejoice if you<lb>
win, to comfort you if you fail, to nurse you if you need<lb>
it, and if you fall to lay you tenderly into your graves,<lb>
with the proud thought, `They did their duty: God will<lb>
remember that, and comfort me.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>The faces of the brothers kindled as she spoke; their<lb>

hearts answered her with a nobler fervor than the chivalrous<lb>
enthusiasm of young blood, and both made a silent<lb>
vow of loyalty, to last inviolate through all their lives,<lb>
as, laying a hand on either head, that brave old mother<lb>
dedicated sons and self to the service of the liberties<lb>
she loved.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Army of the Potomac was on its march northward,<lb>
to defeat Lee's daring raid and make a little Pennsylvania<lb>
village forever memorable. The heights above<lb>
the town were already darkened by opposing troops; the<lb>
quiet valley was already tumultuous with the tramp of<lb>
gathering thousands, and the fruitful fields already reploughed<lb>
for the awful human harvest soon to be gathered<lb>
in. Every road swarmed with blue coats, every<lb>
hill-side was a camp, every grove a bivouac, every wayside<lb>
stream a fountain of refreshment to hundreds of<lb>
weary men spent with the privations and fatigues of those<lb>
forced marches through midsummer heats.</p>
<p>By one of these little brooks a dusty regiment was<lb>
halted for brief repose. At the welcome order, many of<lb>
the exhausted men dropped down where they stood, to<lb>
snatch an hour's sleep; some sought the grateful shade<lb>
of an orchard already robbed of its early fruit, and ate<lb>
their scanty fare with a cheerful content that made it<lb>
sweet; others stretched themselves along the trampled<lb>
borders of the brook, bathing their swollen feet, or drinking<lb>
long draughts of the turbid water, which, to their<lb>
parched lips, was a better cordial than the costliest wine.<lb>
Apart from all these groups, two comrades lay side by<lb>
side in the shadow of the orchard-wall. Both were<lb>
<pb n="210">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-227">

<figdesc>Page 210.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
young and comely men, stalwart, keen-eyed, and already<lb>
bronzed by a Southern sun, although this was their first<lb>
campaign. Both were silent, yet neither slept, and in<lb>
their silence there was a marked difference, &mdash; one lay<lb>
looking straight up through the waving boughs at the<lb>
clear blue overhead, with an expression as serene; the<lb>
other half leaned on his folded arm, moodily plucking at<lb>
the turf which was his pillow, with now and then an<lb>
impatient sigh, a restless gesture. One of these demonstrations<lb>
of discontent presently roused his comrade<lb>
from a waking dream. He sat up, laid a cool hand on the<lb>
other's hot forehead, and said, with brotherly solicitude,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not asleep yet, Rob? I hope you've not had a sunstroke,<lb>
like poor Blake; for, if you are left behind, we<lb>
shall both lose our share of the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well die that way as with a rebel bullet through<lb>
your head; though, if I had my choice, I'd try the last,<lb>
as being the quickest,&rdquo; replied the other, gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn't sound like you, Rob, &mdash; you'll think<lb>
better of it to-morrow, when you've had a night's sound<lb>
sleep. This has been a hard march for a young soldier's<lb>
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much older are you than I, either as man or<lb>
soldier, Rick?&rdquo; asked Robert, half petulantly, half<lb>
proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hours older as a man, ten minutes as a soldier:<lb>
you know I enlisted first. Yet I'm much the elder<lb>
in many things, as you often tell me,&rdquo; said Richard, with<lb>
the smile that always soothed his brother's more fiery<lb>
spirit. &ldquo;One of the privileges of my seniority is the<lb>
care of you; so tell me what harasses you and scares<lb>
rest away?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="211">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-228">

<figdesc>Page 211.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old pain, Rick. All these weeks of absence<lb>
have not lessened it; and the thought of going into a<lb>
battle out of which I may never come alive, without seeing<lb>
her once more, makes me almost resolve to desert,<lb>
and satisfy myself at any cost. You cannot understand<lb>
this, for you don't know what it is to love &mdash; to have a<lb>
woman's face haunting you day and night, to hear a<lb>
woman's voice always sounding in your ears with a distinctness<lb>
that will not let you rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it all, Rob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words seemed to slip involuntarily from the young<lb>
man's lips, for he checked himself sharply, and cast<lb>
an anxious look at his brother. But Robert was too<lb>
absorbed in his own emotions to read those of another,<lb>
and only answered, in a cheerier tone, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean mother. God bless her, wherever she is,<lb>
and send us safely home to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An almost pathetic patience replaced the momentary<lb>
agitation Richard's face betrayed, and his eyes turned<lb>
wistfully towards the green hills that lay between the<lb>
mother and her boys, as he answered, with a smile of<lb>
sorrowful significance, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every man is better and braver for a woman's love;<lb>
so, as I have no younger sweetheart, I shall take the<lb>
dear old lady for my mistress, and try to serve her like a<lb>
loyal knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rick!&rdquo; exclaimed his brother, earnestly, &ldquo;if the<lb>
coming battle proves my last as well as my first, promise<lb>
that for my sake you'll befriend poor Rose, &mdash; that you<lb>
will forgive her, love her, care for her, as if in truth she<lb>
were my widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard grasped the hand outstretched to him, and<lb>
<pb n="212">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-229">

<figdesc>Page 212.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
answered, with a fervor that fully satisfied his brother,<lb>
&ldquo;I promise, Rob!&rdquo; then added quickly, &ldquo;But there<lb>
will be no need of that; for, if mortal man can do it, I<lb>
will keep you, to care for Rose yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the momentary pause that followed came the<lb>
pleasant sound of falling water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, Rob! do you hear it? Give me your canteen,<lb>
and I'll bring you a cool draught that shall remind<lb>
you of the old well at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising as he spoke, Richard went to the low wall that<lb>
rose behind them, swung himself over, and, plunging<lb>
down a ferny slope, found a hidden spring dripping musically<lb>
from mossy crevices among the rocks into a little<lb>
pool below. Pausing a moment to let the shadowy solitude<lb>
of the green nook bathe his weary spirit in its<lb>
peace, he turned to catch the coolest drops that fell; but,<lb>
as he bent, the canteen slipped from his hand and<lb>
splashed unheeded into the pool, for, just opposite,<lb>
through thickly-growing brakes, he caught the glitter of<lb>
a pair of human eyes fixed full upon his face. An<lb>
instant he stood motionless, conscious of that subtle<lb>
thrill through blood and nerves which sudden danger or<lb>
surprise can bring to the stoutest heart. Before he could<lb>
move or speak, the brakes were parted, and the weird,<lb>
withered face of an old woman was lifted to the light.<lb>
One of the despised race, clothed in rags, covered with<lb>
dust, spent with weariness and pain, she lay there, such a<lb>
wild and woful object that the lonely spot seemed chosen<lb>
not as a resting-place, but as a grave. Leaning on one<lb>
arm, she stretched the other trembling hand towards the<lb>
young man, whispering, with an assuring nod, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be skeered, honey; I'se only a pore ole<lb>
<pb n="213">

contyban', gwine up ter de lan' ob freedum, ef I doesn't drap<lb>
down by de way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sick, or hurt, or only tired, my poor soul?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Richard, with such visible compassion in his face<lb>
that the woman's brightened as she answered, with a<lb>
cheerfulness which made her utter destitution more pathetic, &mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'se all dem, and starved inter de bargain; but, bress<lb>
yer, chile, I'se done got used ter dat, and don't mind em<lb>
much ef I kin jes git on a piece ter-day. I'se ben porely<lb>
fer a spell, and layin' by; but I'se mendin' fas', and de<lb>
sight ob de blue-coats and de kine face is mos' as relishin'<lb>
as vittles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have all three, as far as I can give them<lb>
to you,&rdquo; said Richard, offering the last of his day's ration,<lb>
and sitting down opposite the poor old creature,<lb>
who, muttering hasty thanks, seized and devoured the<lb>
food with an almost animal voracity, which proved how<lb>
great her need had been. As the last morsel vanished,<lb>
she drew a long breath, uttered a sigh of satisfaction,<lb>
and, sitting more erect, said, with a deprecating gesture<lb>
and a grateful glance, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massa, I couldn't help forgittin' manners, kase I'se<lb>
ben widout a mouffle sence yisterday, scept two green<lb>
apples and de mint growin' ober dar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been lying here all night? Where do you<lb>
come from, and where are you going? Tell me, without<lb>
fear, and let me help you if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Lord lub yer kine heart, chile, and keep yer fer<lb>
yer mudder. My boys is all gone now; but I knows de<lb>
feelin', and I'll trus' yer, fer's I dares. Yer see, I'se<lb>

Norf to fine my ole man, what missis tuk wid her when<lb>
she lef' us bery suddin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part of the North do you want to find?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Richard, eager to offer the desolate being such help as<lb>
lay in his power. She saw the friendly impulse, and<lb>
thanked him for it with a look; but the distrust born of<lb>
many wrongs was stronger than the desire for sympathy,<lb>
and cautiously, yet humbly, she said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massa mus' please ter 'scuse me ef I doesn't tell jes'<lb>
whar I'se gwine. My pore old man is all dey's lef me;<lb>
and ef missis knowed any ways dat I was lookin' fer<lb>
him, she'd tote him some place whar I couldn't come. It's<lb>
way off bery fur; but de name of de town is wrote<lb>
down in my heart, and, ef I lives, I'll fine it, shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your boys?&rdquo; asked Richard, interested<lb>
in spite of the woman's uninviting aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'se had seven chil'en, honey, but dey's ben sent<lb>
eberywhich way, and I doesn't know whar dey is now,<lb>
scept de dead ones. My darters was sole off years ago;<lb>
one ob my boys was whipped to def, and one tore so wid<lb>
de houn's it was a mercy de dear Lord tuk him. Two<lb>
was put to work on de fortycations down dar; and the<lb>
las' one, my little Mose, starved in my arms as we was<lb>
wadin' fru de big swamps, where we runned when word<lb>
come dat de Yanks was comin' and we'd be free ef we<lb>
got to um. It was bery hard to leave de pore chile dar,<lb>
but dere was two or free more little grabes to keep him<lb>
comp'ny; so I come on alone, and, Glory Halleluyer!<lb>
here I is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how can I help you, ma'am?&rdquo; said Richard,<lb>
involuntarily adding respect to pity, as he heard the<lb>
short, sad story of the losses now past help.</p>
<pb n="215">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-232">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef yer has a bit of money dat yer could spar, chile,<lb>
dat would 'sist me a heap: I kin hide it handy, and git<lb>
vittles or a lif' when de roads is bery bad. I'se mos'<lb>
wore out, fer I'se ben weeks a comin', kase I dunno de<lb>
way, and can't trus' folks much. Now the Yanks is<lb>
gwine my road, I wants to foller fas' as I kin, fer I'se<lb>
shore dey's right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she rambled on, Richard had taken out his<lb>
purse, and halving the small store it contained, offered<lb>
it, saying, kindly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There old friend; I'd gladly do more for you if I<lb>
could. I may be going where I shall never need money<lb>
any more; and, you know, they who give to the poor<lb>
lend to the Lord: so this much will be saved up for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman rose to her knees, and, taking the<lb>
generous hand in both her dusky ones, kissed it with<lb>
trembling lips, wet it with grateful tears, as she cried,<lb>
brokenly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bress yer, chile! bress yer! I'se no words white'<lb>
nuff to tank yer in, but I'll 'member yer all my days,<lb>
and pray de Lord to hold yer safe in de holler ob His<lb>
han'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma'am. What else can I do for you<lb>
before I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes' tell me yer name, honey, so I kin 'mind de Lord<lb>
ob yer tickerlally; fer dere's such a heap ob prayers<lb>
gwine up to Him dese bitter times, He mightn't mine<lb>
sech pore ones as ole June's ef de good name warn't in<lb>
um.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard Stirling,&rdquo; answered the young man, smiling<lb>
at the poor soul's eagerness. &ldquo;Good-by, old mother.<lb>
Keep up a stout heart, and trust the blue-coats when<lb>
<pb n="216">

</eaffig>
you see them, till you find your husband and the happy<lb>
North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he refilled the canteen, the contraband, with<lb>
the fine sentiment so often found in the least promising<lb>
of this affectionate race, hastily gathered a delicate fern<lb>
or two, and, adding the one wild rose that blossomed in<lb>
that shady spot, offered her little nosegay, with a humility<lb>
as touching as her earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a pore give, chile; but I'se nuffin' else sceptin'<lb>
de wish dat yer'll hab all yer want in dis world and de<lb>
nex'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Richard took it, through his mind flashed the<lb>
memory of old romantic legends, wherein weird women<lb>
foretold happy fortunes to young knights pausing at some<lb>
wayside well, &mdash; fortunes to be won only by unshaken<lb>
loyalty to virtue, love, and honor. Looking down upon<lb>
the flower, whose name lent it a double charm to him,<lb>
he said low, to himself, with quickened breath and<lb>
kindling eyes, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A propitious wish! May it be fulfilled, if I deserve<lb>
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the first drum-beat sounded, he pressed the<lb>
hard hand that gave the gift, and sprang up the bank,<lb>
little dreaming how well the grateful heart he left behind<lb>
him would one day remember and repay his charity.</p>
<p>Three days later, the brothers stood side by side in the<lb>
ranks at Gettysburg, impatiently awaiting their turn to<lb>
attack a rebel battery that must be silenced. From<lb>
height to height thundered the cannon; up and down<lb>
the long slopes surged a sea of struggling humanity; all<lb>
the air was darkened by wavering clouds of smoke and<lb>
dust, which lifted only when iron messengers of death<lb>
<pb n="217">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-234">

<figdesc>Page 217.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
tore their way through with deafening reports and sheets<lb>
of flame; while, in the brief pauses that sometimes fell,<lb>
the bands crashed out with dance-music, as if the wild<lb>
excitement of the hour had made them fitting minstrels<lb>
for an awful &ldquo;dance of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Rob, where that goes, we follow while<lb>
we can,&rdquo; whispered Richard, glancing up at the torn flag<lb>
streaming overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm ready, Rick,&rdquo; returned his brother, with flashing<lb>
eyes, set teeth, and in every lineament such visible resolve<lb>
to do and dare, that one hour seemed to have made<lb>
the boy a hero and a man.</p>
<p>As the words left his lips, down the long line rang the<lb>
welcome order, &ldquo;Forward! charge!&rdquo; and, with a shout<lb>
that rose sharp and shrill above the din of arms, the<lb>
brave &mdash;th dashed into the rain of shot and shell.<lb>
Stirred by one impulse, the brothers followed wherever<lb>
through the smoke they caught the flutter of the flag, as<lb>
it was borne before them up the hill. More than once<lb>
it dropped from a dead hand, to be caught up by a living<lb>
one before it touched the ground. Robert Stirling's was<lb>
one of these; and, as he seized the staff, the battlemadness<lb>
seemed to fall upon him, for, waving the banner,<lb>
with a ringing shout he sprang upon the wall, behind<lb>
which rebel riflemen were lying. The sharp sting of a<lb>
ball in the right arm reminded him that he was mortal,<lb>
and at the same instant his brother's hand clutched him,<lb>
his brother's voice called through the din, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're wounded, Rob! For God's sake fall back.&rdquo;<lb>
But, with a grim smile, Robert passed the banner into<lb>
the keeping of his other hand, saying, as his arm dropped<lb>
useless at his side, &mdash;</p>
<pb n="218">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. Clear the way for me, Rick, and let the<lb>
old flag be the first up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loyal cheer from behind drowned the rebel yell that<lb>
rose in front, as a blue wave rolled up and broke over<lb>
the wall, carrying the brothers with it. Above the deadly<lb>
conflict that went on below, the Stars and Stripes tossed<lb>
wildly to and fro; but steadily the color-bearer struggled<lb>
higher, and steadily his body-guard of one went on before<lb>
him, forcing a passage through the press, till, in a single<lb>
instant, there came a hurtling sound, a deafening crash,<lb>
a fiery rain of death-dealing fragments, and, with an<lb>
awful vision of dismembered bodies, wrathful faces panicstricken<lb>
in the drawing of a breath, and a wide gap in<lb>
the swaying mass before him, Robert Stirling was flung,<lb>
stunned and bleeding, against the wall so lately left.</p>
<p>Cries of mortal anguish roused him from a moment's merciful<lb>
oblivion, and showed him that, for his brother and<lb>
himself, the battle was already done. Not far away, half<lb>
hidden under a pile of mingled blue and gray, Richard<lb>
lay quiet on the bloody grass, and, as Robert's dizzy<lb>
eyes wandered up and down his own bruised body to discover<lb>
whence came the sharp agony that wrung his<lb>
nerves, he saw that but one arm now hung shattered at<lb>
his side; the left was gone, and a single glance at the<lb>
ghastly wound sent such a pang of horror through him<lb>
that he closed his eyes, muttering, with white lips, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor mother! it will be hard to lose us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something silken-soft swept across his face, and, looking<lb>
up, he saw that the flag had fallen with him, and lay<lb>
half upright against the wall, still fluttering bravely<lb>
where many eyes could see it, many willing hearts press<lb>
on to defend it. Faithful to the last, he leaned across<lb>
<pb n="219">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-236">

<figdesc>Page 219.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the staff, and, making a shield of his maimed body,<lb>
waited patiently for the coming of friend or foe. How<lb>
the battle went he no longer knew; he scarcely cared;<lb>
for now to him the victories and defeats of life seemed<lb>
over, and Death standing ready to bestow the pale cross<lb>
of the legion of honor, laid on so many quiet breasts as<lb>
the loyal souls depart to their reward.</p>
<p>With strange distinctness came the roar of cannon, the<lb>
sharp, shrill ringing of the minie-halls, the crash of<lb>
bursting shells, the shouts, the groans, even the slow drip<lb>
of his blood, as it plashed down upon the stones; yet<lb>
neither hope nor fear disturbed him now, as all the past<lb>
flashed through his mind and faded, leaving three memories, &mdash;<lb>
his love for Rose, his brother's death, his<lb>
mother's desolation, &mdash; to embitter the memorable moment<lb>
when, with a deathly coldness creeping to his heart, he<lb>
leaned there bleeding his young life away.</p>
<p>To him it seemed hours, yet but a few short minutes<lb>
passed before he became conscious of a friendly atmosphere<lb>
about him, and, through the trance of suffering<lb>
fast reaching its climax, heard a commanding voice<lb>
exclaim, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Stirling: I shall remember this. Take him to<lb>
the rear, and see that he is cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert knew his Colonel's voice, and, gathering up<lb>
both failing strength and sense, he tried to stand erect,<lb>
tried to salute with his one arm, and, failing, said, with<lb>
a piteous look at either wound, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done my best, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brave fellow, you have! What more <hi rend="italics">could</hi> you<lb>
do for the old flag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the glance, the tone, the words of the<lb>
<pb n="220">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-237">

<figdesc>Page 220.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
commander whom he so loved and honored, seemed to<lb>
send new life through the fainting man. His dim eye<lb>
kindled, his voice grew strong and steady, as, forgetful<lb>
of the maimed body it inhabited, the unconquerable<lb>
spirit answered, fervently, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could die for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if in truth he <hi rend="italics">had</hi> done his best, <hi rend="italics">had</hi> died for<lb>
it, Robert Stirling fell forward in the shadow of the<lb>
flag, his head upon the same green pillow where his<lb>
brother's lay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Here's</hi> the paper, and Fisher to read it for us, boys.<lb>
Hush, there, and let's hear what's up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instant silence reigned through the crowded ward<lb>
as the chief attendant entered with the morning sheet<lb>
that daily went the rounds. The convalescents gathered<lb>
about him; the least disabled propped themselves upon<lb>
their arms to listen; even the weakest turned wistful<lb>
eyes that way, and ceased their moaning, that they might<lb>
hear, as Fisher slowly read out the brief despatches, and<lb>
then the mournful lists of wounded, dead, and missing.</p>
<p>Among the many faces in the room, one female one<lb>
appeared; a strong, calm face, with steadfast eyes, and<lb>
lips grown infinitely tender with the daily gospel of patience,<lb>
hope, and consolation which they preached in<lb>
words of motherly compassion. Still bathing and binding<lb>
up a shattered limb, she listened to the reading,<lb>
though her heart stood still to hear, and her face flushed<lb>
and paled with the rapid alternations of hope and fear.<lb>
Presently the one audible voice paused suddenly, and a<lb>
little stir ran through the group as the reader stole an<lb>
<pb n="221">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-238">

<figdesc>Page 221.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
anxious glance at the woman. She saw it, divined its<lb>
meaning, and in an instant seemed to have nerved herself<lb>
for anything. Sponge and bandage dropped from her<lb>
hands, a quick breath escaped her, and an expression of<lb>
sharp anguish for a moment marred the composure of her<lb>
countenance; but she fixed a tearless eye on Fisher,<lb>
asking, steadily, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are my boys' names there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one, ma'am, &mdash; only one, I do assure you; and<lb>
he's merely lost an arm. That's better luck than half<lb>
of 'em have; and now it's got to be a kind of an honor<lb>
to wear an empty sleeve, you know,&rdquo; replied the old man,<lb>
with a half-encouraging, half-remorseful look, as he considerately<lb>
omitted to add the words, &ldquo;and seriously<lb>
wounded in the right,&rdquo; to the line, &ldquo;R. Stirling, left<lb>
arm gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long sigh of thanksgiving left the mother's lips;<lb>
then, with one of the natural impulses of a strong character,<lb>
which found relief in action, she took up the roller<lb>
and resumed her work more tenderly than ever, &mdash; for in<lb>
her sight that shattered arm was her boy's arm now, &mdash;<lb>
only saying, with a face of pale expectancy, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read on, Fisher: I have another son to keep or lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So swift, so subtle, is the magnetism of human sympathy,<lb>
that not a man in all that room but instantly forgot<lb>
himself, his own anxieties, hopes, fears, and waited<lb>
breathlessly for the utterance of that other name. Several<lb>
sat upright in their beds to catch the good or evil tidings<lb>
in the reader's face; one dying man sighed softly, from<lb>
the depths of a homesick heart, &ldquo;Lord, keep him for his<lb>
mother!&rdquo; and the standing group drew closer about<lb>
Fisher, peering over his shoulder, that younger, keener<lb>
<pb n="222">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-239">

<figdesc>Page 222.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
eyes might read the words, and warn him lest they left<lb>
his lips too suddenly for one listener's ear.</p>
<p>Slowly name after name was read, and the long list<lb>
drew near its end. A look of relief already settled upon<lb>
some countenances, and one friendly fellow had turned to<lb>
nod reassuringly at the mother, when a hand clutched<lb>
Fisher's shoulder, and with a start he stopped short in<lb>
the middle of a word. Mrs. Stirling rose up to receive<lb>
the coming blow, and stood there mute and motionless, a<lb>
figure so full of pathetic dignity that many eyes grew<lb>
very dim. A gesture signified her wish, and, with choked<lb>
voice and trembling lips, poor Fisher softly read the brief<lb>
record that one word made so terrible, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;R. Stirling, dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen hands were outstretched to serve her; and, as<lb>
she took it, trying to teach herself that the heavy tidings<lb>
were not false, several caps were silently swept off, &mdash; an<lb>
involuntary tribute of respect to that great grief from<lb>
rough yet tender-hearted men who had no words to offer.</p>
<p>The hurried entrance of a surgeon broke the heavy<lb>
silence; and his brisk voice jarred on every ear, as he<lb>
exclaimed, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, boys! I'm off to the front. God bless<lb>
me! what's the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news for Mrs. Stirling, sir. Do speak to her:<lb>
I can't,&rdquo; whispered Fisher, with two great tears running<lb>
down his waistcoat.</p>
<p>There was no time to speak; three words had roused<lb>
her from the first stupor of her sorrow, and down the<lb>
long room she went, steady and strong again, straight to<lb>
the surgeon, saying, briefly, &mdash;</p>
<pb n="223">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-240">

<figdesc>Page 223.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the front? When do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In half an hour. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Stirling, it is impossible,&rdquo; began the astonished<lb>
gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is impossible to me. I must find my boys,&mdash;<lb>
one living and one dead. For God's sake don't deny<lb>
me this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stretched her hands to him imploringly; she made<lb>
as though she would kneel down before him; and her<lb>
stricken face pleaded for her more eloquently than her<lb>
broken words.</p>
<p>Dr. Hyde was an army surgeon; but a man's heart<lb>
beat warm behind his bright buttons, unhardened by all<lb>
the scenes of suffering, want, and woe through which he<lb>
had been passing for three memorable years. Now it<lb>
yearned over this poor mother with an almost filial pity<lb>
and affection, as he took the trembling hands into his<lb>
own and answered, earnestly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows I would not deny you if it were safe<lb>
and wise to grant your wish. My dear lady, you have<lb>
no conception of the horrors of a battle-field, or the awful<lb>
scenes you must witness in going to the front. These<lb>
hasty lists are not to be relied upon. Wait a little, and<lb>
let me look for your sons. On my soul, I promise to do<lb>
it as faithfully as a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot wait. Another week of such suspense would<lb>
kill me. You never saw my boys. I do not even know<lb>
which is living and which is dead. Then how can you<lb>
look for them as well as I? You would not know the<lb>
poor dead face among a hundred; you would not recognize<lb>
the familiar voice even in the ravings of pain or the<lb>
<pb n="224">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-241">

<figdesc>Page 224.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
din and darkness of those dreadful transports. I can<lb>
bear anything, do anything, go anywhere, to find my<lb>
boys. Oh, sir, by the love you bear your mother, I implore<lb>
you to let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look, the tone, the agony of supplication, made<lb>
her appeal irresistible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; replied the doctor, decidedly, putting all<lb>
objections, obstacles and dangers out of sight. &ldquo;I'll<lb>
delay one hour for you, Mrs. Stirling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up she sprang, as if endowed with the spirit and activity<lb>
of a girl; hope, courage, gratitude, shone in her<lb>
eyes, flushed warm across her face, and sounded in her<lb>
eager voice, as she said, hurrying from the room, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an instant for me. Go as you first proposed. I<lb>
shall be ready long before the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was: for all her thought, her care, was for her<lb>
boys, not for herself; and, when Dr. Hyde went to seek<lb>
her in the matron's room, that busy woman looked up<lb>
from the case of stores she was unpacking, and answered,<lb>
with a sob, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul! she's waiting for you in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>News of her loss and her departure had flown through<lb>
the house; for no nurse there was so beloved and honored<lb>
as &ldquo;Madam Stirling,&rdquo; as the stately old lady was called<lb>
among the boys; and when the doctor led her to the<lb>
ambulance, it was through a crowd of wan and crippled<lb>
creatures gathered there to see her off. Many eyes followed<lb>
her, many lips blessed her, many hands were outstretched<lb>
for a farewell grasp; and, as the ambulance<lb>
went clattering away, old Fisher gave expression to the<lb>
general feeling, when he said, with an air of solemn<lb>
<pb n="225">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-242">

<figdesc>Page 225.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="15">
conviction in almost ludicrous contrast to the emotional contortions<lb>
of his brown countenance, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She'll find 'em! It's borne in upon me uncommon<lb>
strong that the Lord won't rob such a woman of her<lb>
sons, &mdash; bless her stout heart! so give her a cheer, boys,<lb>
and then clear the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did give her a cheer, a right hearty one, &mdash; though<lb>
the voices were none of the strongest, and nearly as many<lb>
crutches as caps were waved in answer to the smile she<lb>
sent them as she passed from sight.</p>
<p>It was not a long journey that lay before her, yet to<lb>
Mrs. Stirling it seemed interminable; for a heavy heart<lb>
went with her, and, through all the hopeful or despondent<lb>
thoughts that haunted her, one unanswerable question<lb>
continually sounded, like a sorrowful refrain, &mdash; &ldquo;One<lb>
killed, one wounded. Which is living? which is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All along the road they went two streams of life continually<lb>
flowed, in opposite directions: one, a sad procession<lb>
of suffering humanity passing hospital, or homeward,<lb>
to live or die, as Heaven willed; the other, an<lb>
almost equally sad procession of pilgrims journeying to<lb>
the battle-field, to find their wounded or to weep their<lb>
dead, &mdash; men and women, old and young, rich and poor,<lb>
all animated by a spirit which made them as one great<lb>
family, through the same costly sacrifice, the same sore<lb>
affliction. It was well for Mrs. Stirling that the weary<lb>
way was a little shortened, the heavy hours a little lightened,<lb>
for her, by the companionship of others bent on a<lb>
like errand. In this atmosphere of general anxiety and<lb>
excitement, accustomed formalities and reserves were forgotten<lb>
or set aside; strangers spoke freely to each other;<lb>
women confidingly asked and gratefully received the<lb>
<pb n="226">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-243">

<figdesc>Page 226.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
chivalrous protection of men, and men yearning for sympathy<lb>
always found it ready in the hearts and eyes of<lb>
women as they told their sorrows and were comforted.<lb>
Many brief tragedies were poured into Mrs. Stirling's<lb>
ear; more than one weaker nature leaned upon her<lb>
strength; more than one troubled soul felt itself calmed<lb>
by the pious patience which touched that worn and venerable<lb>
countenance with an expression which made it an<lb>
unconscious comfort to many eyes; and in seeing, solacing<lb>
the woes of others, she found fresh courage to sustain<lb>
her own.</p>
<p>They came at last, with much difficulty and many delays,<lb>
to the little town in and along which lay nine thousand<lb>
dead, and nearly twenty thousand wounded men.<lb>
Although a week had not yet passed since the thunder of<lb>
the cannon ceased, the place already looked like the vast<lb>
cemetery which it was soon to become; for, in groves<lb>
and fields, by the roadside and along the slopes, wherever<lb>
they fell, lay loyal and rebel soldiers in the shallow graves<lb>
that now are green. The long labor of interment was<lb>
but just begun; for the living appealed more urgently to<lb>
both friend and stranger, and no heart was closed, no<lb>
hand grew weary, while strength and power to aid remained.<lb>
All day supply wagons and cars came full and<lb>
departed empty; all day ambulances rolled to and fro,<lb>
bringing the wounded from remoter parts of the wide<lb>
battle-field to the railroad for removal to fixed hospitals<lb>
elsewhere; all day the relief-stations, bearing the blessed<lb>
sign, &ldquo;U. S. San. Com.,&rdquo; received hundreds of sufferers<lb>
into the shelter of their tents, who must else have laid<lb>
waiting their turn for transportation in the burning July<lb>
sun; all day, and far into the night, red-handed surgeons<lb>
<pb n="227">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-244">

<figdesc>Page 227.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stood at the rude tables, heart-sick and weary with their<lb>
hard yet merciful labors, as shattered body after body<lb>
was laid before them, while many more patiently, even<lb>
cheerfully, awaited their turn; and all day mothers,<lb>
wives, and widows, fathers, friends, and lovers, roamed<lb>
the hills and valleys, or haunted the field-hospitals, searching<lb>
for the loved and lost.</p>
<p>Dr. Hyde was under orders; but for many hours he<lb>
neglected everything but Mrs. Stirling, going with her<lb>
from houses, tents, and churches, to barns, streets, and<lb>
crowded yards; for everywhere the wounded lay thick as<lb>
autumn leaves, &mdash; some on bloody blankets, some on scattered<lb>
straw, a few in cleanly beds, many on the bare<lb>
ground; and if anything could have added to the bitter<lb>
pain of hope deferred, it would have been the wistful<lb>
glances turned on the new-comers from eyes that, seeing<lb>
no familiar face, closed again with a pathetic patience that<lb>
wrung the heart. All day they searched; but nowhere<lb>
did the mother find her boys, nor any tidings of them;<lb>
and, as night fell, her companion besought her to rest<lb>
from the vain search, and accept the hospitality of a<lb>
friendly citizen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Stirling, wait here till morning,&rdquo; the doctor<lb>
said. &ldquo;I must go to my work, but will not till I<lb>
know that you are safe; for you can never wander here<lb>
alone. I will send a faithful messenger far and wide, to<lb>
make inquiries through the night, and hope to greet you<lb>
in the morning with the happiest news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scarcely seemed to hear him, so intent was her<lb>
mind upon the one hope that absorbed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your work, kind friend,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the poor<lb>
souls need you more than I. Have no fears for me. I<lb>
<pb n="228">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-245">

<figdesc>Page 228.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
want neither rest nor food; I only want my boys; and I<lb>
must look for them both day and night, lest one hour of<lb>
idleness should make my coming one hour too late. I<lb>
shall go back to the station. A constant stream of<lb>
wounded men is passing there; and, while I help and<lb>
comfort them, I can see that my boys are not hurried<lb>
away while I am waiting for them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let her have her will, well knowing that for such<lb>
as she there was no rest till hope came, or exhausted<lb>
nature forced her to pause. Back to the relief-station<lb>
they went, and, while Dr. Hyde dressed wounds, issued<lb>
orders, and made diligent inquiry among the throngs that<lb>
came and went, Mrs. Stirling, with other anxious yet<lb>
hopeful, helpful women, moved about the tents, preparing<lb>
nourishment for the men, who came in faster than they<lb>
could be served. Through the whole night she worked,<lb>
lifting water to lips too parched to syllable the word,<lb>
wetting wounds unbandaged for days, feeding famished<lb>
creatures who had lain suffering in solitary places till<lb>
some minister of mercy found and succored them, whispering<lb>
words of good cheer, and, by the cordial comfort<lb>
of her presence, sending many a poor soul on his way<lb>
rejoicing. But, while she worked so tirelessly for others,<lb>
she still hungered for her children, and would not be<lb>
comforted. No ambulance came rumbling from the field<lb>
that she did not hurry out to scan the new-comers with<lb>
an eye that neither darkness nor disguise could deceive;<lb>
not a stretcher with its helpless burden was brought in<lb>
that she did not bend over it with the blessed cup of water<lb>
in her hand, and her poor heart fluttering in her breast;<lb>
and often, among the groups of sleepers that lay everywhere,<lb>
there went a shadowy figure through the night,<lb>
<pb n="229">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-246">

<figdesc>Page 229.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
turning the lantern's glimmer on each pallid face; but<lb>
nowhere did Rick or Rob look back at her with the glad<lb>
cry, &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dawn, Dr. Hyde came to her. With difficulty did<lb>
he prevail upon her to eat a morsel and rest a little, while<lb>
he told her of his night's attempts, and spoke cheerfully<lb>
of the many mishaps, the unavoidable disappointments<lb>
and delay, of such a quest at such a time and place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have searched the town; and Blake and Snow<lb>
will see that no Stirling leaves by any of the trains<lb>
to-day. But the hospitals on the outskirts still remain<lb>
for us, &mdash; besides the heights and hollows; for, on a<lb>
battle-field like this, many men might lie unfound for<lb>
days while search was going on about them. I have a<lb>
wagon here, &mdash; a rough affair, but the best I can get;<lb>
and, if you will not rest, let us go together, and look<lb>
again for these lost sons of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went; and for another long, hot, summer day<lb>
looked on sights that haunted their memories for years,<lb>
listened to sounds that pierced their souls, and with each<lb>
hour felt the weight of impotent compassion weigh heavier<lb>
and heavier upon their hearts. Various and conflicting<lb>
rumors, conjectures, and relations from the comrades of<lb>
the brothers perplexed the seekers, and augmented the<lb>
difficulties of their task. One man affirmed that he saw<lb>
both Stirlings fall; a second, that both were taken prisoners;<lb>
a third, that he had seen both march safely away;<lb>
and a fourth, that Richard was mortally wounded and<lb>
Robert missing. But all agreed in their admiration for<lb>
the virtue and the valor of the brothers, heartily wishing<lb>
their mother success, and unconsciously applying, by their<lb>
commendations, the only balm that could mitigate her<lb>
<pb n="230">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-247">

<figdesc>Page 230.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
pain. Up and down, from dawn till dusk, went the heavyhearted<lb>
pair; but evening came again, and still no sure<lb>
intelligence, no confirmed fear or happy meeting, lightened<lb>
the terrible uncertainty that tortured them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear madam, we have done all that human patience<lb>
and perseverance can do. Now, leave your boys in<lb>
God's hand, and let me care for you as if you were my<lb>
mother,&rdquo; said the compassionate doctor, as they paused,<lb>
dusty, jaded, and dejected, at the good citizen's hospitable<lb>
door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stirling did not answer him. She sat there, an<lb>
image of maternal desolation, her hands locked together<lb>
on her knee, her eyes fixed and unseeing, and in her face<lb>
a still, white anguish piteous to see. With gentlest<lb>
constraint, her friend led her in, laid the gray head down<lb>
upon a woman's breast, and left her to the tender care<lb>
of one who had known a grief like hers.</p>
<p>For hours she lay where kind hands placed her, physically<lb>
spent, yet mentally alert as ever. No passing<lb>
face escaped her, no sound fell unheeded on her ear, no<lb>
movement of those about her was unobserved: yet she<lb>
neither spoke, nor stirred, nor slept, till midnight gathered<lb>
cool and dark above a weary world. Then a brief<lb>
lapse into unconsciousness partially repaired the ravages<lb>
those two hard days had wrought. But even when the<lb>
exhausted body rested, the unwearied soul continued its<lb>
sad quest, and in her dreams the mother found her boys.<lb>
So vivid was the vision, that she suddenly awoke to find<lb>
herself thrilled with a strange joy, trembling with a<lb>
strange expectancy. She rose up in her bed, she put<lb>
away her fallen hair, fast whitening with sorrow's frost,<lb>
<pb n="231">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-248">

<figdesc>Page 231.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and held her breath to listen; for a cry, urgent, imploring,<lb>
distant, yet near, seemed ringing through the room.</p>
<p>From without came the ceaseless rumble of ambulances<lb>
and the tread of hurrying feet; from within, the<lb>
sound of women weeping for their dead, and the low<lb>
moaning of a brave officer fast breathing his life away<lb>
upon his young wife's bosom. No voice spoke, that<lb>
human ear could hear; yet through the mysterious hush<lb>
that fell upon her in that hour, her spirit heard an<lb>
exceeding bitter cry, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! mother! come to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like one possessed by an impulse past control, she<lb>
left her bed, flung on her garments, seized the little store<lb>
of comforts untouched till now, and, without sign or<lb>
sound, glided like a shadow from the house.</p>
<p>The solemn peace of night could not so soon descend<lb>
upon those hills again; nature's tranquillity had been<lb>
rudely broken; and, like the suffering humanity that<lb>
cumbered her wounded breast, she seemed to moan in<lb>
her troubled sleep. Lights flashed from hill and hollow,<lb>
some fixed, some wandering, &mdash; all beacons of hope to<lb>
the living or funeral torches for the dead. Many feet<lb>
went to and fro along the newly-trodden paths; dusky<lb>
figures flitted everywhere, and sounds of suffering filled<lb>
the night-wind with a sad lament. But, upheld by a<lb>
power beyond herself, led by an instinct in which she<lb>
placed blind faith, and unconscious of doubt, or weariness,<lb>
or fear, the solitary woman walked undaunted and<lb>
unscathed through that Valley of the Shadow of Death.</p>
<p>Out from the crowded town she went, turning neither<lb>
to the right nor left, up a steep path her feet had trodden<lb>
once that day, straight to the ruined breastworks formed<lb>
<pb n="232">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-249">

<figdesc>Page 232.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of loose fragments of stone, piled there by many hands<lb>
whose earthly labor was already done. There, gathered<lb>
from among the thickly-strewn dead, and sheltered by<lb>
an awning till they could be taken lower, lay a score of<lb>
men, blue coats and gray, side by side on the bare earth,<lb>
equals now in courage, suffering, and patience. The<lb>
one faithful attendant who kept his watch alone was<lb>
gone for water, that first, greatest need and comfort in<lb>
hours like those, and the dim light of a single lantern<lb>
flickered through the gloom. Utter silence filled the<lb>
dreary place, till from the remotest corner came a faint,<lb>
imploring cry, the more plaintive and piteous for being a<lb>
man's voice grown childlike in its weak wandering: &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! mother! come to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who spoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman's voice, breathless and broken, put the<lb>
question; a woman's figure stood at the entrance of the<lb>
rude shelter; and when a wakeful sufferer answered,<lb>
eagerly, &ldquo;Robert Stirling, just brought in dying. For<lb>
God's sake help him if you can,&rdquo; &mdash; a woman's face,<lb>
transfigured with a sudden joy, flashed swiftly, silently<lb>
before his startled eyes, to bend over one low bed,<lb>
whence came the sound of tender speech, prayerful<lb>
thanksgiving, and the strong sobbing of a man who in<lb>
his hour of extremest need found solace and salvation in<lb>
the dear refuge of his mother's arms.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">They</hi> were alone together, the mother and her one son,<lb>
after weeks of suffering and a long, slow journey, safely<lb>
at home at last. Poor Rob was a piteous sight now, for<lb>

both arms were gone, one at the shoulder, the other at<lb>
the elbow; yet sadder than the maimed body was the<lb>
altered face, for, though wan and wasted by much suffering,<lb>
a strong soul seemed to look out at the despairing<lb>
eyes, as if the captivity of helplessness were more than<lb>
he could bear. A still deeper grief cast its shadow over<lb>
him, making the young man old before his time, for day<lb>
and night his heart cried out for his brother, as if the tie<lb>
between the twin-born could not be divided even by<lb>
death. This longing, which the consolations of neither<lb>
tenderness nor time could appease, was now the only<lb>
barrier to his recovery. Vainly his mother assured him<lb>
that Richard's death had been confirmed by more than<lb>
one account; vainly she tried to comfort him by hopeful<lb>
reminders of a glad reunion hereafter, and endeavored to<lb>
rouse him by appeals to his filial love, telling him that he<lb>
was her all now, and imploring him to live for his old<lb>
mother's sake. He listened, promised, and tried to be<lb>
resigned, but still cherished an unconquerable belief that<lb>
Richard lived, in spite of all reports, appearances, or seeming<lb>
certainties. Asleep, he dreamed of him; awake, he<lb>
talked of him; and the hope of seeing him again in this<lb>
world seemed the only thing that gave Rob patience and<lb>
courage to sustain the burden which life had now become<lb>
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, when shall I be freed from this dreadful<lb>
bed?&rdquo; he broke out, suddenly, as she laid down the book<lb>
she had been reading to deaf ears, and brushed away a<lb>
lock of hair the wind had blown across his forehead, for<lb>
her watchful eye and tireless hand spared him the pain<lb>
of asking any service that recalled his loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weeks yet, dear. It takes nature long to repair<lb>
<pb n="234">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-251">

<figdesc>Page 234.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
such rents in her fine handiwork; but the wounds are<lb>
healing rapidly, thanks to your temperate life and hardy<lb>
frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your devoted care, most faithful of nurses,&rdquo;<lb>
added Robert, turning his lips to the hand that had<lb>
strayed caressingly from forehead to cheek. &ldquo;Do your<lb>
best for me, mother, &mdash; and you can do more than any<lb>
other in the world; get me on my feet again as soon as<lb>
may be, and then, God willing, I'll find Rick if he's<lb>
above the sod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stirling opened her lips to remonstrate against<lb>
the vain purpose, but, seeing the sudden color that lent<lb>
the wan face a semblance of health, hearing the tone of<lb>
energy that strengthened the feeble voice, and remembering<lb>
how deep a root the hope had taken in the brother's<lb>
heart, she silently resolved to let it sustain him if it<lb>
could, undisturbed by a look or word of unbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go together, Rob. My first search was successful;<lb>
Heaven grant my second may be so likewise. I<lb>
will do my best; and when I see you your old self again<lb>
I shall be ready to follow anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old self again! I never can be that, and why I<lb>
was spared to be a burden to you while Rick was taken&mdash;<lb>
no, not taken &mdash; I'll neither say nor think that. If he<lb>
were dead I should either follow him or find comfort in<lb>
the thought that he was at peace; but he is alive, for<lb>
day and night his spirit calls to mine, and I must answer<lb>
it as you answered me when I cried to you in what I<lb>
thought to be my dying hour. Remember, mother, how<lb>
many of our men were found after they were believed to<lb>
to have been killed or taken. John King's grave was<lb>
pointed out to his wife, you know; and, when she had<lb>
<pb n="235">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-252">

<figdesc>Page 235.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
almost broken her poor heart over it, she went home, to<lb>
find him waiting for her there. Why should not some<lb>
such happy chance befall us? Let us believe and hope<lb>
till we can do so no longer, and then I will learn submission.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>His mother only answered with a gentler touch upon<lb>
his head, for in her heart she believed that her son was<lb>
dead. Perhaps the great fear of losing both had made<lb>
the loss seem less when one was spared, or perhaps she<lb>
thought that if either must go Richard was fittest for the<lb>
change, and the nearness she still felt to him made the<lb>
absence of his visible presence less keenly felt than that<lb>
of Robert would have been; for, though as dear, he was<lb>
not so spiritually akin to her as that stronger, gentler<lb>
son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Rose in town, mother?&rdquo; was the abrupt question<lb>
that broke a momentary silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know we have come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She cannot help knowing, when half the town has<lb>
been trooping by with welcomes, messages, and gifts for<lb>
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she will come to welcome us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! her pride will keep her away, you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her pity, rather. Rose has generous impulses, and,<lb>
but for her mistaken education, would have been a right<lb>
noble woman. She may be yet, if love proves strong<lb>
enough to teach her the hard, though happy lesson, that<lb>
shall give her back to you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can never be, mother. What woman could<lb>
love such a wreck; and what right have I to expect or<lb>
<pb n="236">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-253">

<figdesc>Page 236.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hope it, least of all from Rose? No, I am done with<lb>
love; my dream has had a stern awakening; do not talk<lb>
of the impossible to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother smiled the wise smile of one who understood<lb>
the workings of a woman's heart, and, knowing<lb>
both its weakness and its strength, believed that all things<lb>
are possible to love. Perhaps some village gossip had<lb>
breathed a hint into her ear which confirmed her hope;<lb>
or, judging another by herself, she ventured to comfort<lb>
her son by prophesying the return of the dream which he<lb>
believed forever ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will leave that theme for a younger, more persuasive<lb>
woman to discourse upon, when the hour comes in which<lb>
you find that hearts do not always change with changing<lb>
fortunes, that affliction often deepens affection, and when<lb>
one asks a little pity one sometimes receives much love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never ask either of Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she truly loves you there will be no need of asking,<lb>
Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face brightened beautifully as he listened; his eyes<lb>
shone, and he moved impetuously, as if the mere thought<lb>
had power to lift and set him on his feet, a hale and<lb>
happy man again. But weakness and helplessness held<lb>
him down; and, with a sharper pang than that of the<lb>
half-healed wounds, he lay back, exclaiming with a bitter<lb>
sigh, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hope of such a fate for me! I must be content<lb>
with the fulfilment of my other longing, and think of poor<lb>
Rick all the more because I must not think of Rose.<lb>
Oh! if my worst enemy should bring the dear lad home<lb>
to me, I'd joyfully forgive, love, honor him for that one<lb>
act.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>As Robert spoke with almost passionate earnestness, a<lb>
shadow that had lain across the sunny threshold of the<lb>
door vanished as noiselessly as it had come; and unseen,<lb>
unheard, Rose glided back into the green covert of the<lb>
lane, saying within herself, as she hurried on, agitated<lb>
by the mingled pain, pride and passion of the new-born<lb>
purpose at her heart, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Stirling, love <hi rend="italics">shall</hi> prove strong enough to<lb>
make me what I should be, and Robert shall yet forgive<lb>
and honor me; for, if human power can do it, I will<lb>
bring his brother home to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely absorbed by the design that had taken possession<lb>
of her, she hastened back, thinking intently as<lb>
she went; and, when she called her one faithful servant<lb>
to her, all her plans were laid, her resolution fixed, and<lb>
every moment seemed wasted till the first step was taken,<lb>
for now her impetuous spirit could not brook delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jupiter, I am going to Washington in the morning,<lb>
and shall take you with me &mdash; so be ready,&rdquo; was the<lb>
rapid order issued to the astonished old man, who had no<lb>
answer to make, but the usual obedient &mdash; &ldquo;Yes, missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to look for Mrs. Stirling's son, the one<lb>
who is supposed to be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lors, missis, he is dead, shore, &mdash; ain't he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to satisfy myself on that point, if I search<lb>
the prisons, camps, hospitals, and graveyards, from Gettysburg<lb>
to Richmond. I have strength, courage, money,<lb>
and some power, and what better use can I make of them<lb>
than to look for this good neighbor, and ease the hearts<lb>
of those who love him best. Go, Jupe, tell no one of<lb>
my purpose, make ready in all haste, and be sure I will<lb>
reward you well if you serve me faithfully now.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="238">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-255">

<figdesc>Page 238.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, missis, &mdash; you may 'pend on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dawn they were away, the young mistress and<lb>
her old slave. No one knew why they had gone, nor<lb>
whither; and village rumor said Miss Rose had left<lb>
so suddenly because young Stirling and his mother<lb>
had come home. When Mrs. Stirling heard of the<lb>
departure, her old eyes kindled with indignation, while<lb>
her voice trembled with grief, as she said to her<lb>
son, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bitterly disappointed in her; think of her no<lb>
more, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Robert turned his face to the wall, and neither<lb>
spoke nor stirred for many hours.</p>
<p>In ancient times, young knights went out to defend<lb>
distressed dames and free imprisoned damsels; but, in<lb>
our day, the errantry is reversed, and many a stronghearted<lb>
woman goes journeying up and down the land,<lb>
bent on delivering some beloved hero from a captivity<lb>
more terrible than any the old legends tell. Rose was<lb>
now one of these; and, though neither a meek Una nor<lb>
a dauntless Britomart, she resolutely began the long quest<lb>
which was to teach her a memorable lesson, and make a<lb>
loyal woman of the rebel beauty.</p>
<p>At first she haunted hospitals; and, while her heart<lb>
was wrung by the sight of every form of suffering, she<lb>
marked many things that sunk deep into her memory,<lb>
and forced it to bear testimony to the truth. She saw<lb>
Confederate soldiers lying side by side with Union men,<lb>
as kindly treated, almost as willingly served, and twice<lb>
conquered by those who could smite hard like valiant<lb>
soldiers, and then lift up their fallen enemy like Christian<lb>
gentlemen. This sight caused her to recall other scenes<lb>
<pb n="239">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-256">

<figdesc>Page 239.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
in other hospitals, where loyal prisoners lay perishing for<lb>
help, while rebels close by were cherished with every<lb>
demonstration of indulgent care by men and women,<lb>
who not only hardened their hearts against the sadder<lb>
sufferers, but found a cruel pleasure in tormenting them<lb>
by every deprivation and indignity their hatred could<lb>
devise. She had seen a woman, beautiful and young, go<lb>
through a ward leaving fruit, flowers, delicate food and<lb>
kind words behind her, for every Southern man that lay<lb>
there; then offer a cup of water to a Northern soldier,<lb>
and as the parched lips opened eagerly to receive the<lb>
blessed draught, she flung it on the ground and went her<lb>
way with a scornful taunt. This picture was in Rose's<lb>
mind as she stood in a Washington hospital, by the<lb>
death-bed of a former neighbor of her own, hearing the<lb>
fervent thanks uttered with the last breath he drew,<lb>
watching the sweet-faced nurse close the weary eyes,<lb>
fold the pale hands, and then forgetting everything but<lb>
the one fact, that some woman loved and mourned the<lb>
lost rebel, she &ldquo;kissed him for his mother,&rdquo; while Rose<lb>
turned away with full heart and eyes, never again to<lb>
speak contemptuously of Northern men and women.</p>
<p>She visited many battle-fields and graveyards, where<lb>
the low mounds rose thickly everywhere, and an army<lb>
of brave sleepers lay awaiting the call to God's great<lb>
review. Here, too, despite the dreary task before her,<lb>
and the daily disappointment that befell her, she could not<lb>
but contrast the decent burial given to dead enemies<lb>
with the sacrilegious brutality with which her friends<lb>
often tried to rob death of its sanctity by mutilation,<lb>
burning, butchery, and the denial of a few feet of earth<lb>
to cover some poor body which a brave soul had ennobled<lb>
<pb n="240">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-257">

<figdesc>Page 240.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
by its martyrdom. Seeing these things, she could not<lb>
but blush for those whom she once had blindly honored;<lb>
could not but heartily respect those whom she once had<lb>
as blindly distrusted and despised.</p>
<p>She searched many prisons; for, when neither eloquence<lb>
nor beauty could win its way, money proved a golden key,<lb>
and let her in. Here, as elsewhere, the same strong contrast<lb>
was forced upon her; for, while one side fed, clothed,<lb>
and treated their conquered with courteous forbearance,<lb>
often sending them back the richer and better for their<lb>
sojourn, the other side robbed, starved, tormented, and<lb>
often wantonly murdered the helpless victims of the<lb>
chances of war, or returned them worn out with privation<lb>
and neglect to die at home, or to endure the longer<lb>
captivity of strong souls pent in ruined bodies. And<lb>
Rose felt her heart swell with indignant grief and shame,<lb>
as she came out into the free world again, finding the<lb>
shadow of prison-bars across its sunshine, hearing the<lb>
sighs of long-suffering men in every summer wind, and<lb>
fully seeing at last how black a blight slavery and<lb>
treason had brought upon the land she loved.</p>
<p>She went to Hospital Directories, those kindly instituted<lb>
intelligence offices for anxious hearts, and there<lb>
she saw such sorrowful scenes, yet heard such cheerful,<lb>
courageous words, that sympathy and admiration contended<lb>
for the mastery in the Southern woman's breast.<lb>
She heard an old mother say proudly, as she applied for<lb>
a pass, &ldquo;I have had seven sons in the army; three are<lb>
dead, and two are wounded, but I'm glad my boys went.&rdquo;<lb>
She saw a young wife come to meet her husband, and<lb>
learn that he was waiting for her in his coffin; but<lb>
though her heart was broken, there was no murmuring<lb>
<pb n="241">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-258">

<figdesc>Page 241.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="16">
at the heavy loss, no bitter denunciation of those who<lb>
had made her life so desolate, only a sweet submission,<lb>
and sustaining consolation in the knowledge that the<lb>
great sacrifice had been freely made, and the legacy of<lb>
an honorable name had been bequeathed to the baby at<lb>
her breast. Lads came asking for fathers, and whether<lb>
they found them dead or wounded, the spirit of patriotism<lb>
burned undiminished in their enthusiastic hearts,<lb>
and each was eager to fill the empty place, undaunted<lb>
by pain and peril of the life. Old men mingled, with<lb>
their tearless lamentations for lost sons, their own regrets<lb>
that they too could not shoulder guns, and fight the<lb>
good fight to the end.</p>
<p>All these loyal demonstrations sunk deeply into Rose's<lb>
softened heart, and in good time bore fruit; for now she<lb>
began to think within herself, &ldquo;Surely, a war which<lb>
does so much for a people, making women glad to give<lb>
their best and dearest, men eager to lay down their lives,<lb>
strengthening, purifying, and sustaining all, must be a<lb>
holy war, approved by God, and sure of victory in the<lb>
end.&rdquo; The last touch needed to complete the work of<lb>
regeneration was yet to come; but slowly, surely this<lb>
long discipline made her ready to receive it.</p>
<p>Her search, meanwhile, had not proved fruitless, for<lb>
after many disappointments one fact was established<lb>
beyond doubt: Richard Stirling was not killed at Gettysburg.<lb>
By the merest chance she met, in one of the<lb>
Union hospitals which she visited, a rebel lieutenant who<lb>
told her that the same shell wounded both Stirling and<lb>
himself, and when the first attack was repulsed, that<lb>
Richard was taken prisoner, and sent to the rear with<lb>
others of his regiment. An hour later, the lieutenant<lb>
<pb n="242">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-259">

<figdesc>Page 242.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
himself was taken by our men when they returned to<lb>
the charge; but whether Stirling lived or died he could<lb>
not tell: probably the latter, being severely wounded in<lb>
head and chest.</p>
<p>The smile, the thanks Rose gave in return for these<lb>
good tidings, and the comforts she gratefully provided,<lb>
would have made captivity dangerously alluring to the<lb>
young lieutenant had she remained. But armed with<lb>
this intelligence she went on her way rejoicing, eager to<lb>
trace and follow the army of prisoners that had gone<lb>
southward. Weeks had been consumed in her search,<lb>
and already rumors of the horrors of the Libby Prisonhouse<lb>
and Belle Island had disturbed and shocked the<lb>
North. Haunted with woful recollections of all the<lb>
varied sufferings she had seen, her imagination pictured<lb>
Richard weak and wounded, shivering and starving,<lb>
while she waited with full hands and eager heart to save,<lb>
and heal, and lead him home. Intent on reaching Richmond,<lb>
she besieged officials in high places as well as low,<lb>
money flowed like water, and every faculty was given to<lb>
the work. It seemed as if she had undertaken an impossibilty;<lb>
for though all pitied, tried to help, and heartily<lb>
admired the beautiful brave woman, no one could serve<lb>
her as she would be served; and she began to exercise<lb>
her fertile wit in devising some way in which she could<lb>
attain her object by stratagem, if all other means should<lb>
fail.</p>
<p>Waiting in her carriage, one day, at the door of a<lb>
helpful friend's office, while Jupe carried up a message,<lb>
she was startled from an anxious reverie by the sudden<lb>
appearance of an agitated black countenance at the<lb>
<pb n="243">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-260">

<figdesc>Page 243.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
window, and the sound of an incoherent voice, exclaiming,<lb>
between laughter and tears, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bress de Lord, and sing hallyluyer! I'se foun'<lb>
her! I'se foun' her! Doesn't yer know me, Missy Rose?<lb>
I'se old June, and I'se run away; but I doesn't kere<lb>
nuffin what comes ob me ef missy'll jes' lem me see my<lb>
pore ole man once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Juno's infinite surprise, no frown appeared upon<lb>
the face of her young mistress, and no haughty reprimand<lb>
followed the recognition of the half-ludicrous, halfpathetic<lb>
tatterdemalion who addressed her, but a white<lb>
hand was put forth to draw the new-comer in, and the<lb>
familiar voice answered with a friendliness never heard<lb>
before, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jupe is safe, and you shall see him soon. Come in,<lb>
you poor old soul, come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In bundled the delighted creature, and began to tell<lb>
her story, but stopped in the middle to dart out again,<lb>
and fall upon the neck of the bewildered Jupiter, as he<lb>
came soberly up to deliver his message. Fortunately it<lb>
was a quiet street, else that tumultuous meeting might<lb>
have been productive of discomfort to all parties; for the<lb>
old couple wept, laughed, and sung, &mdash; went down upon<lb>
their knees to thank Heaven, &mdash; got up to embrace, and<lb>
dance, and weep again, in a perfect abandonment of<lb>
gratitude, affection and delight. When Rose could<lb>
make herself heard, she bade them both enter the carriage;<lb>
then drawing down the curtains, and ordering the<lb>
coachman to drive slowly round the square, she let the<lb>
reunited husband and wife give free vent to their emotions,<lb>
till from sheer weariness they grew calm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hopes missis will 'scuse us actin' so wild, but<lb>
<pb n="244">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-261">

<figdesc>Page 244.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
'pears like we couldn't help it, comin' so bery sudden an'<lb>
undispected,&rdquo; apologized Jupe, wiping away the last of<lb>
his own and Juno's tears with the same handkerchief,<lb>
which, very properly, was a miniature star-spangled<lb>
banner.</p>
<p>But Rose's own eyes were wet; and in her sight there<lb>
was nothing unlovely or unmannerly in that natural outbreak<lb>
of affection, for she had learned to feel for others<lb>
now, and the same stern discipline which made her both<lb>
strong and humble, taught her to see much that was true<lb>
and touching in the spectacle of the gray heads bent<lb>
towards each other; the wrinkled faces shining with joy;<lb>
the hard hands locked together, as the childless, friendless<lb>
old pair found freedom, happiness, and rest for a<lb>
moment in each other's arms. Like a true woman, Juno<lb>
calmed herself first, that she might talk; and, emboldened<lb>
by the gracious change in her once imperious<lb>
mistress, she told the story of her wanderings at length;<lb>
not forgetting the chief incident of her long and lonely<lb>
flight, the meeting with Robert Stirling. At the sound<lb>
of his name, both Rose and Jupe exclaimed, and Juno<lb>
was rapidly made acquainted with the mission which<lb>
had brought them there. Deeply impressed with the<lb>
circumstance, and a sense of her own importance, the<lb>
good soul entered heartily into the matter, saying, with<lb>
the pious simplicity of her race, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De ways ob de Lord is 'mazing 'sterious! but we's<lb>
boun' to b'lieve dat He'll take special kere ob dat dear<lb>
chile, elseways we shouldn't hab ben brung togedder so<lb>
cur'us. I tole de blessed gen'l'man I'd 'member him, and<lb>
I has; I prayed ter be spared ter see his kine face agin,<lb>
an' I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where? when? Oh, Juno, you were surely sent to<lb>
me in my last extremity,&rdquo; cried Rose, now trembling<lb>
with interest and impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was dis way, missy. When dat dear gen'l'man<lb>
lef me I creeped on a piece, but was tuk sick, an' a kind<lb>
fam'ly kep' me a long time. Den I come on agin bery<lb>
slow, an' one day as I was gwine fru a town, &mdash; I'se los'<lb>
de name, but it don't matter, &mdash; as I was gwine fru dat<lb>
town, dere come a lot ob pris'ners frum Gettysbury,<lb>
or some place like dat, a gwine to Richmun. Dear heart,<lb>
honey, dey was an orfle sight, all lame, an' rags, an' hungry,<lb>
an' de folks run out into de street wid bread ter feed um.<lb>
De guard was bery ugly, and wouldn't let de folks come<lb>
night ter do it, so dey jes' fell back and frowed de vittles<lb>
ober de heads of dem rebs, and de pore souls cotched it<lb>
as ef it was de manny dey tells of in de Bible. I helped<lb>
um; yes, missy, I couldn't stay still noways, so I runned<lb>
into a bake-shop wid some more women, and we stood in<lb>
de winders and hev de bread down to de starvin' creeters<lb>
in de street mighty hearty, you'm be shore ob dat. I<lb>
had a big loaf in my han', and was lookin' roun' for de<lb>
starvinest man dar, when I saw de bery face dat looked<lb>
so kine inter mine younder by de spring. I tank de Lord<lb>
I'd kep de name handy, fer I screeched right out, `Oh,<lb>
Massa Stirlin'! Massa Stirlin'! dis yere's for you wid<lb>
my lub.' He looked up, he 'membered me, he larfed all<lb>
over his pore thin face, jes' as he done de day I gib him<lb>
de rose. Oh, missy! he was hurted bad; dey had tuk<lb>
away his hat, and coat, and shoes, and I saw his head<lb>
was tied up, and dere was a great red stain on de bosom<lb>
ob his shirt, and he looked so weak and wore down dat<lb>
I jes bus out cryin', and forgot all 'bout de bread till I<lb>
<pb n="246">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-263">

<figdesc>Page 246.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
was gwine to wipe my eyes wid it. Den I got my wits<lb>
togedder and gib de loaf such a great chuck dat I mos'<lb>
fell out a winder, but he got it; I sawed him break it in<lb>
bits and gib em roun' to de pore boys side ob him, some<lb>
wid no arms to grab wid, some too hurted to fight and<lb>
run for it like de res. Den I'se fraid he won't had nuf<lb>
for his self, so I gets more and fros it far, and he larfs<lb>
out hearty like a boy, and calls to me, `I tank yer, ma'am.<lb>
God bless yer!' Dat set me cryin' agin, like a ole fool<lb>
as I is, and when I come to dey was movin' on agin, and<lb>
de las I see ob dat dear soul he was marchin' brave, wid<lb>
de sun beatin' down on his pore head, de hot sand burnin'<lb>
his pore feet, and a sick boy hangin' on his arm. But<lb>
fer all dat he kep lookin' back, noddin' and smilin' till<lb>
dey was clean gone, and dere was nuffin left but prayers<lb>
and sobbin' all dat day fer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certain then that he has gone to Richmond; I<lb>
must follow. Jupe, what message did Mr. Norton send<lb>
me?&rdquo; asked Rose, remembering her unanswered inquiry<lb>
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bery busy, Missis, elseways he come down and<lb>
see yer; but he says dere's no gittin' any passes, and de<lb>
only 'vice he can gib, is dat you goes to 'Napolis and<lb>
looks dere, kase dere's ben some pris'ners fetched dere<lb>
frum Belle Island, and dere's jes one chance dat Massa<lb>
Stirlin' mought be 'mong em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll go! Jupe, order the man back to the hotel.<lb>
There's not a moment to be lost,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, missy, lem me go wid you!&rdquo; implored Juno. &ldquo;I<lb>
knows I don't look bery spectable, but I'll follow on hind<lb>
yer some ways: I'se good at nussin', I can pry roun' in<lb>
places whar a lady couldn't, and ef dat bressed gen'l'man<lb>

</eaffig>
ain't dar, I'll jes go back and try to fetch him out ob de<lb>
lan' ob bondage like I did myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall go, Juno, for without you I should still be<lb>
groping in the dark. Surely Heaven helps me, and I<lb>
feel that I shall find him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did find him, but how? She went to Annapolis,<lb>
where a hundred and eighty exchanged prisoners had<lb>
just arrived, and entering the hospital, stood aghast at<lb>
the sight before her. Men who for weeks had been confined<lb>
on that desert waste, Belle Island, without shelter<lb>
or clothing, almost without food, and no help, sick or<lb>
well, lay there dead or dying from starvation and neglect.<lb>
Nurses, inured to many forms of suffering, seemed dismayed<lb>
at the awful spectacle of living skeletons famishing<lb>
for food, yet too weak to taste when eager hands tried<lb>
to minister to them. Some were raving in the last stage<lb>
of their long agony; some were hopelessly insane; many<lb>
had died unconscious that they were among friends; and<lb>
others were too far gone to speak, yet dumbly grateful<lb>
for the help that came too late.</p>
<p>Heart-wrung and horror-stricken, Rose could only pray<lb>
that she might not find Richard among these victims of a<lb>
barbarous revenge which made her disown and denounce<lb>
the cause she had clung to until then, and oppressed her<lb>
with a bitter sense of remorse for ever giving it her allegiance.<lb>
As she stood struggling with a flood of thoughts<lb>
and feelings too strong for utterance, old Juno, who had<lb>
pressed on before her, beckoned with an eager hand.<lb>
Going to her, Rose found her bending over the mournful<lb>
ghost of a man who lay there like one dead, with hollow<lb>
eyes fast shut, the pinched mouth breathless, the wasted<lb>
limbs stiff and cold, and no trace of Richard Stirling<lb>
<pb n="248">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-265">

<figdesc>Page 248.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
visible, for the frightful emaciation, the long, neglected hair<lb>
and beard, so changed him that his own mother might<lb>
have passed by without a glance of recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not he, Juno. Poor soul, poor soul! cover his<lb>
face, and let him rest,&rdquo; sighed Rose, with tremulous lips,<lb>
bending to lay her delicate handkerchief over the piteous<lb>
face, one glance at which had made her eyes too dim for<lb>
seeing, and seemed to utter a mute reproach, as if the<lb>
loss of this life lay at her door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <hi rend="italics">is</hi> de dear boy, missy; I'se shore ob it, fer see<lb>
what I foun' in dis faded little bag dat lay on his heart,<lb>
when I feeled to see if dere was any beat lef. Here's a<lb>
bit ob gray her in a paper wid somefin wrote on it, an'<lb>
here's de flower I gib him. I knows it by de red string<lb>
I pulled out ob my old shawl to tie de posy wid. Ah,<lb>
honey, I specks he smiled so when he tuk de rose, an'<lb>
kep it, kase he tort ob you, and lubbed you bery dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little case and the dead flower fell from Rose's<lb>
hand, as she read these words upon the worn paper that<lb>
held the gray curl: &ldquo;For Rick from mother, May 10,<lb>
1863&rdquo;; and she laid her warm cheek down beside that<lb>
chilly one, crying through the heartiest, happiest tears<lb>
she ever shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Richard, have I come too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the touch of tender lips, the magnetism<lb>
of a living, loving heart, seemed to arrest the weary<lb>
spirit in its flight, and call it back to life by the power of<lb>
that passion which outlives death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De heart's a beatin', and de bref's a comin', shore.<lb>
Lif up his head, honey! Jupe, fan him bery kereful,<lb>
while I gets a drop ob brandy down his frote, an' rubs<lb>
<pb n="249">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-266">

<figdesc>Page 249.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
dese pore hans dat is all bones. Dear boy, we's got yer,<lb>
Def may go 'way now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juno both worked and spoke as if the young man were<lb>
her son; for she forgot all differences of rank, color, and<lb>
condition, in her glad gratitude to nurse him like a<lb>
mother. Rose laid the unconscious head upon her<lb>
bosom, and, brushing back the tangled hair, watched the<lb>
faint flutter of the eyelids, as life came creeping back,<lb>
and hope dawned again for both of them; for she felt that<lb>
Richard's restoration would win Robert's pardon, and be<lb>
her best atonement for the past.</p>
<p>It was long before he was himself again, but Juno<lb>
never left him, day or night; Jupe was a sleepless, tireless<lb>
guard, and Rose ministered to him with heart as<lb>
well as hand, seeming to hold death at bay by the sheer<lb>
force of an indomitable will. He knew the forms about<lb>
him, at last; and the happiest moment of Rose's life was<lb>
that in which he looked up in her face with eyes that<lb>
blessed her for her care, and whispered feebly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had suffered much, but this atones for<lb>
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, every hour brought fresh strength, and<lb>
renewed assurances that the danger had gone by. At<lb>
this point Juno discovered that her soul was stronger<lb>
than her body, for the latter gave out, and Rose commanded<lb>
her to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need you no longer, for my work is nearly done,&rdquo;<lb>
she said. &ldquo;Jupe, I told you that if you served me well<lb>
you should be rewarded, and I will keep my word. This<lb>
paper assures your freedom, and your wife's, forever; this<lb>
purse contains a little fortune, to keep you above want<lb>
while you live. Take the late gift, my good old friends,<lb>
<pb n="250">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-267">

<figdesc>Page 250.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and forgive me for the wrong I have done you all these<lb>
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose's subdued yet earnest manner, and the magnitude<lb>
of the gift, restrained the rapture of the old pair, which<lb>
found vent only in a demonstration that touched Rose<lb>
more than a stream of thanks and blessings. Holding<lb>
fast the precious paper that gave them freedom only at<lb>
life's close, they put back the money, feeling too rich in<lb>
that other gift to fear want, and, taking one of the white<lb>
hands in their black ones, they kissed them, wet them<lb>
with grateful tears, and clung to them, imploring to be<lb>
allowed to stay with her, to serve her, love her, and be<lb>
her faithful followers to the end.</p>
<p>Much moved, she gave the promise; and happier than<lb>
any fabled king and queen of Olympus were the old<lb>
freedman and his wife, when they went away to nurse<lb>
each other for a little while, at their mistress's desire,<lb>
leaving her to tend the &ldquo;General,&rdquo; as Jupe insisted upon<lb>
calling Richard, laboring under a delusion that, because<lb>
he had suffered much, he must have received honor<lb>
and promotion.</p>
<p>Very quiet, useful hours were those that followed, and<lb>
these proved the sincerity of her amendment, by the zeal<lb>
with which she performed many a distasteful duty for<lb>
Richard and his companions in misfortune, the patience<lb>
with which she bore many discomforts, the energy with<lb>
which she met and conquered all obstacles to the fulfilment<lb>
of her purpose. Unconsciously Richard did more<lb>
for her than she for him: because, though unseen, his<lb>
work was both more difficult and more enduring than her<lb>
own. She nursed and nourished an exhausted body;<lb>
he, by the influence of character, soothed and sustained<lb>
<pb n="251">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-268">

<figdesc>Page 251.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
an anxious soul, helped Rose to find her better self, and,<lb>
through the force of a fair example, inspired her with<lb>
noble emulation. They talked much, at first: Rose was<lb>
the speaker, and an eloquent one; for Richard was very<lb>
like his brother, as she had last seen him, and she felt the<lb>
charm of that resemblance. Then, as Richard gained<lb>
strength, he loved to lie conversing upon many themes,<lb>
too happy in her presence to remember the sad past, or to<lb>
cherish a fear for the unknown future. Having lived a<lb>
deep and earnest life of late, Rose found herself fitted to<lb>
comprehend the deep and earnest thoughts that found<lb>
expression in those confidential hours; for if ever men<lb>
and women are their simplest, sincerest selves, it is when<lb>
suffering softens the one, and sympathy strengthens the<lb>
other.</p>
<p>Often Rose caught a wistful look fixed on her face, as<lb>
she read or worked beside her patient, in the little room<lb>
now set apart for him, and she could not but interpret it<lb>
aright, since the story of the rose had given her a key to<lb>
that locked heart. Poor Richard loved her still, and was<lb>
beginning to hope that Juno's wish might be fulfilled, for<lb>
Rose seldom spoke of Rob, had shivered and turned<lb>
pale when she told his great misfortune, and, man-like,<lb>
Richard believed that her love had changed to pity, and<lb>
might, in time, be given to Robert's unmarred counterpart.<lb>
He was very slow to receive this hope, very remorseful<lb>
when he thought of Rob, and very careful not<lb>
to betray the troubled joy that was doing more toward<lb>
his recovery than any cordial that passed his lips. But,<lb>
when the time came for them to think of turning homeward,<lb>
he felt that he could not meet his brother with any<lb>
secret hidden in his heart; and, with the courage that<lb>
<pb n="252">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-269">

<figdesc>Page 252.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
was as natural to him as his patience, he ended his suspense,<lb>
and manfully went to meet his fate.</p>
<p>Rose had been reading him to sleep one night, and<lb>
fancying, from his stillness, that she had succeeded, she<lb>
closed her book, and sat watching the thin face that looked<lb>
so pale and peaceful in the shaded light that filled the<lb>
room. Not long did she study it, for suddenly the clear<lb>
eyes opened, and, as if some persistent thought found<lb>
utterance, almost against his will, he asked, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose, why did you come to find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She divined the true meaning of the look, the words,<lb>
with a woman's instinct, and answered both with the<lb>
perfect truth which they deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your brother wanted you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his sake you came for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Rose, you &mdash; you love him still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help it, when he needs me more than<lb>
ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Richard's face changed terribly; then<lb>
something seemed to gush warm across his heart, sending<lb>
a generous glow to cheek and forehead, banishing<lb>
the despair from his eyes, and lending to his voice a<lb>
heartiness unheard before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Rose; you are a nobler woman than I<lb>
thought you. He does need you more than ever; give<lb>
him your whole heart, and help me to make his hard life<lb>
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will &mdash; God bless my brother Rick!&rdquo; and, bending,<lb>
Rose kissed him softly on the forehead, the only<lb>
token that ever betrayed her knowledge of his love, the<lb>
<pb n="253">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-270">

<figdesc>Page 253.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
only atonement she had it in her power to make him for<lb>
his loss.</p>
<p>Richard held the beautiful, beloved face close to his<lb>
own an instant, then turned his head away, and Rose<lb>
heard one strong, deep sob, but never any word of lamentation<lb>
or reproach. Too much moved to speak, yet<lb>
too full of sympathy to leave him, she leaned her head<lb>
upon the arm of the cushioned chair in which she sat,<lb>
and soon forgot the lapse of time in thoughts both sweet<lb>
and bitter. A light rustle and a faint perfume recalled<lb>
her to the present; and looking, without moving, she saw<lb>
Richard's almost transparent hand hold the dead rose in<lb>
the flame of the lamp until its ashes fluttered to the<lb>
ground; she saw him watch the last spark fade, and<lb>
shiver as he glanced drearily about the room, as if all the<lb>
warmth and beauty had died out of his life, leaving it<lb>
very desolate and dark; she saw him turn toward her<lb>
while his face grew clear and calm again, and, believing<lb>
himself unseen, he lifted a little fold of her dress to his<lb>
lips, as if he bade the woman whom he loved a long farewell;<lb>
then he lay down like one spent with some sore<lb>
struggle, which, though hardly fought, had been wholly<lb>
won.</p>
<p>At that sight Rose's tears fell fast; and, long after<lb>
Richard slept the sleep of utter weariness, she still sat<lb>
there, with her head pillowed on her arms, keeping a<lb>
vigil in which she consecrated her whole life to the service<lb>
of that cause which, through many trials, had taught<lb>
her a truer loyalty, a purer love.</p>
<p>In the ruddy glow of an October sunset, Rose led<lb>
Richard across the threshold of the dear old home, and<lb>
<pb n="254">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-271">

<figdesc>Page 254.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
gave him to his mother's arms. At first, a joyful tumult<lb>
reigned; then, as the wonder, gratitude, and joy subsided,<lb>
all turned to Rose. She stood apart, silently receiving<lb>
her reward; and, though worn and weary with<lb>
her long labor, never had she seemed so beautiful as<lb>
then; for the once proud eyes were grown sweetly<lb>
humble, the serenity of a great content shone in her face,<lb>
and a fine blending of gentleness and strength gave the<lb>
crowning grace to one who was now, in truth, a &ldquo;right<lb>
noble woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother and her sons regarded her in silence for a<lb>
moment, and silently she looked back at them with a<lb>
glance, a gesture that said more eloquently than any<lb>
words: &ldquo;Forgive me, love me, and forget the past.&rdquo; Mrs.<lb>
Stirling opened her arms, and Rose clung to that motherly<lb>
bosom, feeling that no daughter could be dearer<lb>
than she was now, that all her pain and penitence was<lb>
known, and her reward secure at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose, I have but one thing precious enough to give<lb>
you in return for the great service you have so beautifully<lb>
conferred upon me. If I read your heart aright, this is<lb>
the prize for which you have striven and suffered; and,<lb>
loving you the dearer for your constancy, I freely give<lb>
one-half my treasure to your keeping, sure that you will<lb>
find life richer, happier, and better for your devotion to<lb>
the man you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose understood her, &mdash; felt that the mother wished to<lb>
prove the woman's pride, the lover's truth, &mdash; and well<lb>
she stood the test; for going straight to Robert, who had<lb>
scarcely spoken, but whose eye had never left her since<lb>
she came, she said, clearly and steadily, &mdash; too earnest<lb>
<pb n="255">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-272">

<figdesc>Page 255.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
for maiden shame, too humble for false pride, too hopeful<lb>
for any fear, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert, you once said you would never ask either<lb>
pity or love of me. Will you accept both when I offer<lb>
them humbly, heartily, and tell you that all my happiness,<lb>
my hopes, my peace, are now bound up in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Rob! he had no arms in which to receive her,<lb>
no words wherewith to welcome her, for speech failed<lb>
him when those tender eyes looked up into his own, and<lb>
she so generously gave him the desire of his life. He<lb>
only bowed his head before her, deliciously oppressed<lb>
with the happiness this double gift conferred. Rose read<lb>
his heart, and with a loving woman's skill robbed the moment<lb>
of all its bitterness and left only its sweetness; for,<lb>
putting both arms about his neck, she whispered like a<lb>
pleading child, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, let me stay; I am so happy here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was but one answer to that appeal; and as it<lb>
was given, Mrs. Stirling turned to beckon Richard from<lb>
the room, glad to have him all her own again. He had<lb>
already stolen out, and standing in the autumn sunshine,<lb>
looked across the quiet river with a countenance as cheerful<lb>
as the sunshine, as tranquil as the stream. His<lb>
mother scanned his face with a searching yet sorrowful<lb>
eye, that dimmed with sudden dew as, reading its significance,<lb>
her son met it with a glance that set her anxiety<lb>
at rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fears for me, mother; I have fought my<lb>
double fight, and am freed from my double captivity.<lb>
The lost love is not dead, but sleeping, never to waken<lb>
in this world, and its grave is growing green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my good son, the world will see Rob's sacrifice,<lb>
<pb n="256">

</eaffig>
and honor him for it, but yours is the greater one, for<lb>
through many temptations you have been loyal, both to<lb>
your country and yourself. God and your mother love<lb>
and honor you for that, although to other eyes you seem<lb>
to stand forgotten and alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Richard drew the gray head tenderly, reverently<lb>
down upon his breast, and answered, with the cheerful<lb>
smile unchanged, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never alone while I have you, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>AMONG green New-England hills stood an ancient<lb>
house, many-gabled, mossy-roofed, and quaintly<lb>
built, but picturesque and pleasant to the eye; for a<lb>
brook ran babbling through the orchard that encompassed<lb>
it about, a garden-plot stretched upward to the whispering<lb>
birches on the slope, and patriarchal elms stood sentinel<lb>
upon the lawn, as they had stood almost a century<lb>
ago, when the Revolution rolled that way and found<lb>
them young.</p>
<p>One summer morning, when the air was full of country<lb>
sounds, &mdash; of mowers in the meadow, blackbirds by<lb>
the brook, and the low of cattle on the hill-side, the old<lb>
house wore its cheeriest aspect, and a certain humble<lb>
history began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Di.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a head, brown-locked, blue-eyed, soft-featured,<lb>
looked in at the open door in answer to the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just bring me the third volume of `Wilhelm Meister,'<lb>
there's a dear. It's hardly worth while to rouse such<lb>
a restless ghost as I, when I'm once fairly laid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, Di pushed up her black braids, thumped<lb>
the pillow of the couch where she was lying, and with<lb>
eager eyes went down the last page of her book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Laura,&rdquo; replied the girl, coming back with the<lb>
third volume for the literary cormorant, who took it with<lb>
a nod, still too intent upon the &ldquo;Confessions of a Fair<lb>
Saint&rdquo; to remember the failings of a certain plain sinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't forget the Italian cream for dinner. I depend<lb>
upon it; for it's the only thing fit for me this hot weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Laura, the cool blonde, disposed the folds of her<lb>
white gown more gracefully about her, and touched up<lb>
the eyebrow of the Minerva she was drawing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have plenty of clean collars in my bag, for I<lb>
must go at three; and some of you bring me a glass of<lb>
cider in about an hour, &mdash; I shall be in the lower garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man went away into his imaginary paradise,<lb>
and Nan into that domestic purgatory on a summer day,&mdash;<lb>
the kitchen. There were vines about the windows,<lb>
sunshine on the floor, and order everywhere; but it was<lb>
haunted by a cooking-stove, that family altar whence such<lb>
varied incense rises to appease the appetite of household<lb>
gods, before which such dire incantations are pronounced<lb>
to ease the wrath and woe of the priestess of the fire,<lb>
and about which often linger saddest memories of wasted<lb>
temper, time, and toil.</p>
<p>Nan was tired, having risen with the birds, hurried,<lb>
having many cares those happy little housewives never<lb>
know, and disappointed in a hope that hourly &ldquo;dwindled,<lb>
peaked, and pined.&rdquo; She was too young to make the<lb>
<pb n="259">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-276">

<figdesc>Page 259.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
anxious lines upon her forehead seem at home there, too<lb>
patient to be burdened with the labor others should have<lb>
shared, too light of heart to be pent up when earth and<lb>
sky were keeping a blithe holiday. But she was one of<lb>
that meek sisterhood who, thinking humbly of themselves,<lb>
believe they are honored by being spent in the service of<lb>
less conscientious souls, whose careless thanks seem<lb>
quite reward enough.</p>
<p>To and fro she went, silent and diligent, giving the<lb>
grace of willingness to every humble or distasteful task<lb>
the day had brought her; but some malignant sprite<lb>
seemed to have taken possession of her kingdom, for<lb>
rebellion broke out everywhere. The kettles would boil<lb>
over most obstreperously, &mdash; the mutton refused to cook<lb>
with the meek alacrity to be expected from the nature of<lb>
a sheep, &mdash; the stove, with unnecessary warmth of temper,<lb>
would glow like a fiery furnace, &mdash; the irons would<lb>
scorch, &mdash; the linens would dry, &mdash; and spirits would fail,<lb>
though patience never.</p>
<p>Nan tugged on, growing hotter and wearier, more<lb>
hurried and more hopeless, till at last the crisis came; for<lb>
in one fell moment she tore her gown, burnt her hand,<lb>
and smutched the collar she was preparing to finish in<lb>
the most unexceptionable style. Then, if she had been<lb>
a nervous woman, she would have scolded; being a<lb>
gentle girl, she only &ldquo;lifted up her voice and wept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, she watereth her linen with salt tears, and<lb>
bewaileth herself because of much tribulation. But, lo!<lb>
help cometh from afar: a strong man bringeth lettuce<lb>
wherewith to stay her, plucketh berries to comfort her<lb>
withal, and clasheth cymbals that she may dance for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice came from the porch, and, with her hope<lb>
<pb n="260">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-277">

<figdesc>Page 260.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fulfilled, Nan looked up to greet John Lord, the housefriend,<lb>
who stood there with a basket on his arm; and as<lb>
she saw his honest eyes, kind lips, and helpful hands, the<lb>
girl thought this plain young man the comeliest, most<lb>
welcome sight she had beheld that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good of you, to come through all this heat, and<lb>
not to laugh at my despair!&rdquo; she said, looking up like a<lb>
grateful child, as she led him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only obeyed orders, Nan; for a certain dear old<lb>
lady had a motherly presentiment that you had got into<lb>
a domestic whirlpool, and sent me as a sort of life preserver.<lb>
So I took the basket of consolation, and came<lb>
to fold my feet upon the carpet of contentment in the<lb>
tent of friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, John gave his own gift in his mother's<lb>
name, and bestowed himself in the wide window-seat,<lb>
where morning-glories nodded at him, and the old butternut<lb>
sent pleasant shadows dancing to and fro.</p>
<p>His advent, like that of Orpheus in Hades, seemed to<lb>
soothe all unpropitious powers with a sudden spell. The<lb>
fire began to slacken, the kettles began to lull, the meat<lb>
began to cook, the irons began to cool, the clothes began<lb>
to behave, the spirits began to rise, and the collar was<lb>
finished off with most triumphant success. John watched<lb>
the change, and, though a lord of creation, abased himself<lb>
to take compassion on the weaker vessel, and was<lb>
seized with a great desire to lighten the homely tasks<lb>
that tried her strength of body and soul. He took a comprehensive<lb>
glance about the room; then, extracting a<lb>
dish from the closet, proceeded to imbrue his hands in<lb>
the strawberries' blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, you needn't do that; I shall have time<lb>
<pb n="261">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-278">

<figdesc>Page 261.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
when I've turned the meat, made the pudding, and done<lb>
these things. See, I'm getting on finely now, &mdash; you're a<lb>
judge of such matters; isn't that nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Nan offered the polished absurdity for<lb>
inspection with innocent pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that I were a collar, to sit upon that hand!&rdquo;<lb>
sighed John; adding, argumentatively, &ldquo;As to the<lb>
berry question, I will merely say, that, as a matter of<lb>
public safety, you'd better leave me alone; for such is<lb>
the destructiveness of my nature, that I shall certainly<lb>
eat something hurtful, break something valuable, or sit<lb>
upon something crushable, unless you let me concentrate<lb>
my energies by knocking off these young fellows' hats,<lb>
and preparing them for their doom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the matter in a charitable light, Nan consented,<lb>
and went cheerfully on with her work, wondering<lb>
how she could have thought ironing an infliction, and<lb>
been so ungrateful for the blessings of her lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where's Sally?&rdquo; asked John, looking vainly for the<lb>
energetic functionary who usually pervaded that region like<lb>
a domestic police-woman, a terror to cats, dogs, and men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone to her cousin's funeral, and won't be<lb>
back till Monday. There seems to be a great fatality<lb>
among her relations, for one dies, or comes to grief in<lb>
some way, about once a month. But I don't blame poor<lb>
Sally for wanting to get away from this place now and<lb>
then. I think I could find it in my heart to murder an<lb>
imaginary friend or two, if I had to stay here long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nan laughed so blithely, it was a pleasure to<lb>
hear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where's Di?&rdquo; asked John, seized with a most unmasculine<lb>
curiosity all at once.</p>
<pb n="262">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-279">

<figdesc>Page 262.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in Germany, with `Wilhelm Meister,' but,<lb>
though `lost to sight, to memory dear'; for I was just<lb>
thinking, as I did her things, how clever she is to like all<lb>
kinds of books that I don't understand at all, and to write<lb>
things that make me cry with pride and delight. Yes,<lb>
she's a talented dear, though she hardly knows a needle<lb>
from a crow-bar, and will make herself one great blot<lb>
some of these days, when the `divine afflatus' descends<lb>
upon her, I'm afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nan rubbed away with sisterly zeal at Di's forlorn<lb>
hose and inky pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Laura?&rdquo; proceeded the inquisitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I might say that <hi rend="italics">she</hi> was in Italy; for she is<lb>
copying some fine thing of Raphael's, or Michael Angelo's,<lb>
or some great creature's or other; and she looks so picturesque<lb>
in her pretty gown, sitting before her easel, that<lb>
it's really a sight to behold, and I've peeped two or three<lb>
times to see how she gets on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nan bestirred herself to prepare the dish wherewith<lb>
her picturesque sister desired to prolong her artistic<lb>
existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your father?&rdquo; John asked again, checking<lb>
off each answer with a nod and a little frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is down in the garden, deep in some plan about<lb>
melons, the beginning of which seems to consist in stamping<lb>
the first proposition in Euclid all over the bed, and<lb>
then poking a few seeds into the middle of each. Why,<lb>
bless the dear man! I forgot it was time for the cider.<lb>
Wouldn't you like to take it to him, John? He'd love<lb>
to consult you; and the lane is so cool, it does one's<lb>
heart good to look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John glanced from the steamy kitchen to the shadowy<lb>
<pb n="263">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-280">

<figdesc>Page 263.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
path, and answered, with a sudden assumption of immense<lb>
industry, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn't possibly go, Nan, I've so much on my<lb>
hands. You'll have to do it yourself. `Mr. Robert of<lb>
Lincoln' has something for your private ear; and the<lb>
lane is so cool, it will do one's heart good to see you in<lb>
it. Give my regards to your father, and, in the words<lb>
of `Little Mabel's' mother, with slight variations, &mdash;</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>`Tell the dear old body</l>
<l rend="indent">This day I cannot run,</l>
<l>For the pots are boiling over</l>
<l rend="indent">And the mutton isn't done.&rdquo;'</l>
</lg></q>
<p>&ldquo;I will; but please, John, go in to the girls and be<lb>
comfortable; for I don't like to leave you here,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insinuate that I should pick at the pudding or<lb>
skim the cream, do you? Ungrateful girl, leave me!&rdquo;<lb>
And, with melodramatic sternness, John extinguished<lb>
her in his broad-brimmed hat, and offered the glass like<lb>
a poisoned goblet.</p>
<p>Nan took it, and went smiling away. But the lane<lb>
might have been the Desert of Sahara, for all she knew<lb>
of it; and she would have passed her father as unconcernedly<lb>
as if he had been an apple-tree, had he not<lb>
called out, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand and deliver, little woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed the venerable highwayman, and followed<lb>
him to and fro, listening to his plans and directions with<lb>
a mute attention that quite won his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hop-pole is really an ornament now, Nan; this<lb>
sage-bed needs weeding, &mdash; that's good work for you girls;<lb>
<pb n="264">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-281">

<figdesc>Page 264.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and, now I think of it, you'd better water the lettuce in<lb>
the cool of the evening, after I'm gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all of which remarks Nan gave her assent; though<lb>
the hop-pole took the likeness of a tall figure she had seen<lb>
in the porch, the sage-bed, curiously enough, suggested<lb>
a strawberry ditto, the lettuce vividly reminded her of<lb>
certain vegetable productions a basket had brought, and<lb>
the bobolink only sung in his cheeriest voice, &ldquo;Go<lb>
home, go home! he is there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found John, &mdash; having made a Freemason of himself,<lb>
by assuming her little apron, &mdash; meditating over the<lb>
partially spread table, lost in amaze at its desolate appearance;<lb>
one-half its proper paraphernalia having been forgotten,<lb>
and the other half put on awry. Nan laughed<lb>
till the tears ran over her cheeks, and John was gratified<lb>
at the efficacy of his treatment; for her face had brought<lb>
a whole harvest of sunshine from the garden, and all her<lb>
cares seemed to have been lost in the windings of the lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan, are you in hysterics?&rdquo; cried Di, appearing, book<lb>
in hand. &ldquo;John, you absurd man, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm helpin' the maid-of-all-work, please marm.&rdquo;<lb>
And John dropped a courtesy with his limited apron.</p>
<p>Di looked ruffled, for the merry words were a covert<lb>
reproach; and with her usual energy of manner and<lb>
freedom of speech she tossed &ldquo;Wilhelm&rdquo; out of the<lb>
window, exclaiming, irefully, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's always the way; I'm never where I ought to<lb>
be, and never think of anything till it's too late; but it's<lb>
all Goethe's fault. What does he write books full of<lb>
smart `Phillinas' and interesting `Meisters' for? How<lb>
can I be expected to remember that Sally's away, and<lb>
people must eat, when I'm hearing the `Harper' and<lb>
<pb n="265">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-282">

<figdesc>Page 265.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
little `Mignon'? John, how dare you come here and do<lb>
my work, instead of shaking me and telling me to do it<lb>
myself? Take that toasted child away, and fan her like<lb>
a Chinese mandarin, while I dish up this dreadful dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John and Nan fled like chaff before the wind, while<lb>
Di, full of remorseful zeal, charged at the kettles, and<lb>
wrenched off the potatoes' jackets, as if she were revengefully<lb>
pulling her own hair. Laura had a vague<lb>
intention of going to assist; but, getting lost among the<lb>
lights and shadows of Minerva's helmet, forgot to appear<lb>
till dinner had been evoked from chaos, and peace was<lb>
restored.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, Di performed the coronation ceremony<lb>
with her father's best hat; Laura retied his old-fashioned<lb>
neck-cloth, and arranged his white locks with an eye to<lb>
saintly effect; Nan appeared with a beautifully written<lb>
sermon, and suspicious ink-stains on the fingers that<lb>
slipped it into his pocket; John attached himself to the<lb>
bag; and the patriarch was escorted to the door of his<lb>
tent with the triumphal procession which usually attended<lb>
his outgoings and incomings. Having kissed the female<lb>
portion of his tribe, he ascended the venerable chariot,<lb>
which received him with audible lamentation, as its<lb>
rheumatic joints swayed to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, my dears! I shall be back early on Monday<lb>
morning; so take care of yourselves, and be sure<lb>
you all go and hear Mr. Emerboy preach to-morrow. My<lb>
regards to your mother, John. Come, Solon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Solon merely cocked one ear, and remained a fixed<lb>
fact; for long experience had induced the philosophic<lb>
beast to take for his motto the Yankee maxim, &ldquo;Be sure<lb>
<pb n="266">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-283">

<figdesc>Page 266.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
you're right, then go ahead!&rdquo; He knew things were<lb>
not right; therefore he did not go ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, girls, don't forget to pay Tommy<lb>
Mullein for bringing up the cow; he expects it to-night.<lb>
And, Di, don't sit up till daylight, nor let Laura stay out<lb>
in the dew. Now, I believe, I'm off. Come, Solon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Solon only cocked the other ear, gently agitated<lb>
his mortified tail, as premonitory symptoms of departure,<lb>
and never stirred a hoof, being well aware that it always<lb>
took three &ldquo;comes&rdquo; to make a &ldquo;go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me! I've forgotten my spectacles. They are<lb>
probably shut up in that volume of Herbert on my table.<lb>
Very awkward to find myself without them ten miles<lb>
away. Thank you, John. Don't neglect to water the<lb>
lettuce, Nan, and don't overwork yourself, my little<lb>
`Martha.' Come &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture Solon suddenly went off at a trot,<lb>
and the benign old pastor disappeared, humming &ldquo;Hebron&rdquo;<lb>
to the creaking accompaniment of the bulgy<lb>
chaise.</p>
<p>Laura retired to take her <hi rend="italics">siesta;</hi> Nan made a small<lb>
<hi rend="italics">carbonaro</hi> of herself by sharpening her sister's crayons,<lb>
and Di, as a sort of penance for past sins, tried her<lb>
patience over a piece of knitting, in which she soon<lb>
originated a somewhat remarkable pattern, by dropping<lb>
every third stitch, and seaming <foreign lang="la" rend="italics">ad libitum.</foreign> If John had<lb>
been a gentlemanly creature, with refined tastes, he<lb>
would have elevated his feet, and made a nuisance of<lb>
himself by indulging in a &ldquo;weed&rdquo;; but being only an<lb>
uncultivated youth, with a rustic regard for pure air and<lb>
womankind in general, he kept his head uppermost, and<lb>
talked like a man, instead of smoking like a chimney.</p>
<pb n="267">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-284">

<figdesc>Page 267.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will probably be six months before I sit here<lb>
again, tangling your threads and maltreating your<lb>
needles, Nan. How glad you must feel to hear it!&rdquo;<lb>
he said, looking up from a thoughtful examination of the<lb>
hard-working little citizens of the Industrial Community<lb>
settled in Nan's work-basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I'm very sorry; for I like to see you coming<lb>
and going as you used to, years ago, and I miss you<lb>
very much when you are gone, John,&rdquo; answered truthful<lb>
Nan, whittling away in a sadly wasteful manner, as her<lb>
thoughts flew back to the happy times when a little lad<lb>
rode a little lass in the big wheelbarrow, and never spilt<lb>
his load, &mdash; when two brown heads bobbed daily side by<lb>
side to school, and the favorite play was &ldquo;Babes in the<lb>
Wood,&rdquo; with Di for a somewhat peckish robin to cover<lb>
the small martyrs with any vegetable substance that lay<lb>
at hand. Nan sighed as she thought of these things,<lb>
and John regarded the battered thimble on his finger-tip<lb>
with increased benignity of aspect as he heard the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going to make your fortune, John,<lb>
and get out of that disagreeable hardware concern?&rdquo;<lb>
demanded Di, pausing after an exciting &ldquo;round,&rdquo; and<lb>
looking almost as much exhausted as if it had been a<lb>
veritable pugilistic encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to make it by plunging still deeper into<lb>
`that disagreeable hardware concern'; for, next year,<lb>
if the world keeps rolling, and John Lord is alive, he<lb>
will become a partner, and then &mdash; and then &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color sprang up into the young man's cheek, his<lb>
eyes looked out with a sudden light, and his hand<lb>
seemed involuntarily to close, as if he saw and seized<lb>
some invisible delight.</p>
<pb n="268">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-285">

<figdesc>Page 268.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen then, John?&rdquo; asked Nan, with a<lb>
wondering glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you in a year, Nan, &mdash; wait till then.&rdquo; And<lb>
John's strong hand unclosed, as if the desired good were<lb>
not to be his yet.</p>
<p>Di looked at him, with a knitting-needle stuck into her<lb>
hair, saying, like a sarcastic unicorn, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really thought you had a soul above pots and<lb>
kettles, but I see you haven't; and I beg your pardon<lb>
for the injustice I have done you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a whit disturbed, John smiled, as if at some<lb>
mighty pleasant fancy of his own, as he replied, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Di; and as a further proof of the utter<lb>
depravity of my nature, let me tell you that I have the<lb>
greatest possible respect for those articles of ironmongery.<lb>
Some of the happiest hours of my life have been<lb>
spent in their society; some of my pleasantest associations<lb>
are connected with them; some of my best lessons<lb>
have come to me from among them; and when my<lb>
fortune is made, I intend to show my gratitude by taking<lb>
three flat-irons rampant for my coat-of-arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan laughed merrily, as she looked at the burns on<lb>
her hand; but Di elevated the most prominent feature<lb>
of her brown countenance, and sighed despondingly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, what a disappointing world this is! I<lb>
no sooner build a nice castle in Spain, and settle a smart<lb>
young knight therein, than down it comes about my<lb>
ears; and the ungrateful youth, who might fight dragons<lb>
if he chose, insists on quenching his energies in a saucepan,<lb>
and wasting his life on a series of gridirons. Ah,<lb>
if <hi rend="italics">I</hi> were a man, I would do something better than that,<lb>
and prove that heroes are not all dead yet. But, instead<lb>
<pb n="269">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-286">

<figdesc>Page 269.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of that, I'm only a woman, and must sit rasping my<lb>
temper with absurdities like this.&rdquo; And Di wrestled<lb>
with her knitting as if it were Fate, and she were paying<lb>
off the grudge she owed it.</p>
<p>John leaned toward her, saying, with a look that made<lb>
his plain face handsome, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Di, my father began the world as I begin it, and<lb>
left it the richer for the useful years he spent here, &mdash;<lb>
as I hope I may leave it some half-century hence. His<lb>
memory makes that dingy shop a pleasant place to me;<lb>
for there he made an honest name, led an honest life,<lb>
and bequeathed to me his reverence for honest work.<lb>
That is a sort of hardware, Di, that no rust can corrupt,<lb>
and which will always prove a better fortune than any<lb>
your knights can win with sword and shield. I think<lb>
I am not quite a clod, or quite without some aspirations<lb>
above money-getting; for I have a great ambition to<lb>
become as good a man, and leave as green a memory<lb>
behind me, as old John Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Di winked violently, and seamed five times in perfect<lb>
silence; but quiet Nan had the gift of knowing when to<lb>
speak, and by a timely word saved her sister from a<lb>
thunder-shower and her stocking from destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, have you seen Philip since you wrote about<lb>
your last meeting with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was for John, but the soothing tone was<lb>
for Di, who gratefully accepted it, and perked up again<lb>
with speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I meant to have told you about it,&rdquo; answered<lb>
John, plunging into the subject at once. &ldquo;I saw<lb>
him a few days before I came home, and found him more<lb>
disconsolate than ever, &mdash; `just ready to go to the deuce,'<lb>
<pb n="270">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-287">

<figdesc>Page 270.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
as he forcibly expressed himself. I consoled the poor lad<lb>
as well as I could, telling him his wisest plan was to defer<lb>
his proposed expedition, and go on as steadily as he had<lb>
begun, &mdash; thereby proving the injustice of your father's<lb>
prediction concerning his want of perseverance, and the<lb>
sincerity of his affection. I told him the change in<lb>
Laura's health and spirits was silently working in his<lb>
favor, and that a few more months of persistent endeavor<lb>
would conquer your father's prejudice against him, and<lb>
make him a stronger man for the trial and the pain. I<lb>
read him bits about Laura from your own and Di's letters,<lb>
and he went away, at last, as patient as Jacob, ready<lb>
to serve another `seven years' for his beloved Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you for it, John!&rdquo; cried a fervent voice;<lb>
and, looking up, they saw the cold, listless Laura transformed<lb>
into a tender girl, all aglow with love and longing,<lb>
as she dropped her mask, and showed a living<lb>
countenance eloquent with the first passion and softened<lb>
by the first grief of her life.</p>
<p>John rose involuntarily in the presence of an innocent<lb>
nature whose sorrow needed no interpreter to him. The<lb>
girl read sympathy in his brotherly regard, and found<lb>
comfort in the friendly voice that asked, half playfully,<lb>
half seriously, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell him that he is not forgotten, even for an<lb>
Apollo? that Laura the artist has not conquered Laura<lb>
the woman? and predict that the good daughter will yet<lb>
prove the happy wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a gesture full of energy, Laura tore her Minerva<lb>
from top to bottom, while two great tears rolled down<lb>
the cheeks grown pale with hope deferred.</p>
<pb n="271">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-288">

<figdesc>Page 271.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him I believe all things, hope all things, and that<lb>
I never can forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan went to her and held her close, leaving the prints<lb>
of two loving, but grimy hands upon her shoulders; Di<lb>
looked on approvingly, for, though rather stony-hearted<lb>
regarding the cause, she fully appreciated the effect; and<lb>
John, turning to the window, received the commendations<lb>
of a robin swaying on an elm-bough, with sunshine<lb>
on its ruddy breast.</p>
<p>The clock struck five, and John declared that he must<lb>
go; for, being an old-fashioned soul, he fancied that his<lb>
mother had a better right to his last hour than any<lb>
younger woman in the land, &mdash; always remembering that<lb>
&ldquo;she was a widow, and he her only son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan ran away to wash her hands, and came back with<lb>
the appearance of one who had washed her face also, &mdash;<lb>
and so she had, but there was a difference in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play I'm your father, girls, and remember it will be<lb>
six months before `that John' will trouble you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which preface the young man kissed his former<lb>
playfellows as heartily as the boy had been wont to do,<lb>
when stern parents banished him to distant schools, and<lb>
three little maids bemoaned his fate. But times were<lb>
changed now, for Di grew alarmingly rigid during the<lb>
ceremony; Laura received the salute like a grateful<lb>
queen; and Nan returned it with heart and eyes and<lb>
tender lips, making such an improvement on the childish<lb>
fashion of the thing, that John was moved to support his<lb>
paternal character by softly echoing her father's words,&mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;Take care of yourself, my little `Martha.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>Then they all streamed after him along the gardenpath,<lb>
with the endless messages and warnings girls are<lb>
<pb n="272">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-289">

<figdesc>Page 272.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
so prone to give; and the young man, with a great softness<lb>
at his heart, went away, as many another John has<lb>
gone, feeling better for the companionship of innocent<lb>
maidenhood, and stronger to wrestle with temptation, to<lb>
wait, and hope, and work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's throw a shoe after him for luck, as dear old<lb>
`Mrs. Gummidge' did after `David' and the `willin'<lb>
Barkis!' Quick, Nan! you always have old shoes on;<lb>
toss one, and shout `Good luck!&rdquo;' cried Di, with one<lb>
of her eccentric inspirations.</p>
<p>Nan tore off her shoe, and threw it far along the dusty<lb>
road, with a sudden longing to become that auspicious<lb>
article of apparel, that the omen might not fail.</p>
<p>Looking backward from the hill-top, John answered<lb>
the meek shout cheerily, and took in the group with a<lb>
lingering glance: Laura in the shadow of the elms, Di<lb>
perched on the fence, and Nan leaning far over the gate,<lb>
with her hand above her eyes and the sunshine touching<lb>
her brown hair with gold. He waved his hat and turned<lb>
away; but the music seemed to die out of the blackbird's<lb>
song, and in all the summer landscape his eye saw nothing<lb>
but the little figure at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless and save us! here's a flock of people coming!<lb>
My hair is in a toss, and Nan's without her shoe; run!<lb>
fly, girls! or the Philistines will be upon us!&rdquo; cried Di,<lb>
tumbling off her perch in sudden alarm.</p>
<p>Three agitated young ladies, with flying draperies and<lb>
countenances of mingled mirth and dismay, might have<lb>
been seen precipitating themselves into a respectable<lb>
mansion with unbecoming haste; but the squirrels were<lb>
the only witnesses of this &ldquo;vision of sudden flight,&rdquo; and,<lb>
being used to ground-and-lofty tumbling, didn't mind it.</p>

<p>When the pedestrians passed, the door was decorously<lb>
closed, and no one visible but a young man, who snatched<lb>
something out of the road, and marched away again,<lb>
whistling with more vigor of tone than accuracy of tune,&mdash;<lb>
only that, and nothing more.</p>
<p rend="center">HOW IT WAS FOUND.</p>
<p>Summer ripened into autumn, and something fairer<lb>
than<lb>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;Sweet-peas and mignonette</l>
<l>In Annie's garden grew.&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
Her nature was the counterpart of the hill-side grove,<lb>
where as a child she had read her fairy tales, and now<lb>
as a woman turned the first pages of a more wondrous<lb>
legend still. Lifted above the many-gabled roof, yet not<lb>
cut off from the echo of human speech, the little grove<lb>
seemed a green sanctuary, fringed about with violets,<lb>
and full of summer melody and bloom. Gentle creatures<lb>
haunted it, and there was none to make afraid; woodpigeons<lb>
cooed and crickets chirped their shrill roundelays,<lb>
anemones and lady-ferns looked up from the moss that<lb>
kissed the wanderer's feet. Warm airs were all afloat,<lb>
full of vernal odors for the grateful sense, silvery birches<lb>
shimmered like spirits of the wood, larches gave their<lb>
green tassels to the wind, and pines made airy music<lb>
sweet and solemn, as they stood looking heavenward<lb>
through veils of summer sunshine or shrouds of wintry<lb>
snow. Nan never felt alone now in this charmed wood;<lb>
for, when she came into its precincts, once so full of solitude,<lb>
all things seemed to wear one shape; familiar eyes<lb>
looked at her from the violets in the grass, familiar words<lb>
<pb n="274">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-291">

<figdesc>Page 274.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sounded in the whisper of the leaves, and she grew conscious<lb>
that an unseen influence filled the air with new<lb>
delights, and touched earth and sky with a beauty never<lb>
seen before. Slowly these May-flowers budded in her<lb>
maiden heart, rosily they bloomed, and silently they<lb>
waited till some lover of such lowly herbs should catch<lb>
their fresh aroma, should brush away the fallen leaves,<lb>
and lift them to the sun.</p>
<p>Though the eldest of the three, she had long been<lb>
overtopped by the more aspiring girls. But, though she<lb>
meekly yielded the reins of government, whenever they<lb>
chose to drive, they were soon restored to her again; for<lb>
Di fell into literature, and Laura into love. Thus engrossed,<lb>
these two forgot many duties which even bluestockings<lb>
and <hi rend="italics">innamoratas</hi> are expected to perform, and<lb>
slowly all the homely humdrum cares that housewives<lb>
know became Nan's daily life, and she accepted it without<lb>
a thought of discontent. Noiseless and cheerful as<lb>
the sunshine, she went to and fro, doing the tasks that<lb>
mothers do, but without a mother's sweet reward, holding<lb>
fast the numberless slight threads that bind a household<lb>
tenderly together, and making each day a beautiful<lb>
success.</p>
<p>Di, being tired of running, riding, climbing, and boating,<lb>
decided, at last, to let her body rest, and put her<lb>
equally active mind through what classical collegians<lb>
term &ldquo;a course of sprouts.&rdquo; Having undertaken to read<lb>
and know <hi rend="italics">everything,</hi> she devoted herself to the task with<lb>
great energy, going from Sue to Swedenborg with perfect<lb>
impartiality, and having different authors as children<lb>
have sundry distempers, being fractious while they lasted,<lb>
but all the better for them when once over. Carlyle<lb>
<pb n="275">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-292">

<figdesc>Page 275.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
appeared like scarlet-fever, and raged violently for a time;<lb>
for, being anything but a &ldquo;passive bucket,&rdquo; Di became<lb>
prophetic with Mahomet, belligerent with Cromwell, and<lb>
made the French Revolution a veritable Reign of Terror<lb>
to her family. Goethe and Schiller alternated like fever<lb>
and ague; Mephistopheles became her hero, Joan of Arc<lb>
her model, and she turned her black eyes red over Egmont<lb>
and Wallenstein. A mild attack of Emerson followed,<lb>
during which she was lost in a fog; and her<lb>
sisters rejoiced inwardly when she emerged, informing<lb>
them that</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;The Sphinx was drowsy,</l>
<l>Her wings were furled.&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Poor Di was floundering slowly to her proper place;<lb>
but she splashed up a good deal of foam by getting out<lb>
of her depth, and rather exhausted herself by trying to<lb>
drink the ocean dry.</p>
<p>Laura, after the &ldquo;midsummer night's dream&rdquo; that<lb>
often comes to girls of seventeen, woke up to find that<lb>
youth and love were no match for age and commonsense.<lb>
Philip had been flying about the world like a<lb>
thistle-down for five-and-twenty years, generous-hearted,<lb>
frank, and kind, but with never an idea of the serious<lb>
side of life in his handsome head. Great, therefore,<lb>
were the wrath and dismay of the enamored thistle-down,<lb>
when the father of his love mildly objected to seeing her<lb>
begin the world in a balloon, with a very tender but very<lb>
inexperienced aeronaut for a guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura is too young to `play house' yet, and you are<lb>
too unstable to assume the part of lord and master,<lb>
Philip. Go and prove that you have prudence, patience,<lb>
<pb n="276">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-293">

<figdesc>Page 276.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
energy, and enterprise, and I will give you my girl, &mdash;<lb>
but not before. I must seem cruel, that I may be truly<lb>
kind; believe this, and let a little pain lead you to great<lb>
happiness, or show you where you would have made a<lb>
blunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lovers listened, owned the truth of the old man's<lb>
words, bewailed their fate, and &mdash; yielded: Laura for<lb>
love of her father Philip for love of her. He went<lb>
away to build a firm foundation for his castle in the air,<lb>
and Laura retired into an invisible convent, where she<lb>
cast off the world, and regarded her sympathizing sisters<lb>
through a grate of superior knowledge and unsharable<lb>
grief. Like a devout nun, she worshipped &ldquo;St. Philip,&rdquo;<lb>
and firmly believed in his miraculous powers. She fancied<lb>
that her woes set her apart from common cares, and<lb>
slowly fell into a dreamy state, professing no interest in<lb>
any mundane matter, but the art that first attracted<lb>
Philip. Crayons, bread-crusts and gray paper became<lb>
glorified in Laura's eyes; and her one pleasure was to sit<lb>
before her easel, day after day, filling her portfolios with<lb>
the faces he had once admired. Her sisters observed<lb>
that every Bacchus, Piping Faun, or Dying Gladiator<lb>
bore some likeness to a comely countenance that heathen<lb>
god or hero never owned; and, seeing this, they privately<lb>
rejoiced that she had found such solace for her<lb>
grief.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lord's keen eye had read a certain newly-written<lb>
page in her son's heart, &mdash; his first chapter of that romance,<lb>
begun in Paradise, whose interest never flags,<lb>
whose beauty never fades, whose end can never come<lb>
till Love lies dead. With womanly skill she divined the<lb>
secret, with motherly discretion she counselled patience,<lb>
<pb n="277">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-294">

<figdesc>Page 277.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and her son accepted her advice, feeling that, like many<lb>
a healthful herb, its worth lay in its bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love like a man, John, not like a boy, and learn to<lb>
know yourself before you take a woman's happiness into<lb>
your keeping. You and Nan have known each other all<lb>
your lives; yet, till this last visit, you never thought you<lb>
loved her more than any other childish friend. It is too<lb>
soon to say the words so often spoken hastily &mdash; so hard<lb>
to be recalled. Go back to your work, dear, for another<lb>
year; think of Nan in the light of this new hope; compare<lb>
her with comelier, gayer girls; and by absence<lb>
prove the truth of your belief. Then, if distance only<lb>
makes her dearer, if time only strengthens your affection,<lb>
and no doubt of your own worthiness disturbs you, come<lb>
back and offer her what any woman should be glad to<lb>
take, &mdash; my boy's true heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John smiled at the motherly pride of her words, but<lb>
answered, with a wistful look, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems very long to wait, mother. If I could just<lb>
ask her for a word of hope, I could be very patient<lb>
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, better bear one year of impatience<lb>
now than a lifetime of regret hereafter. Nan is happy;<lb>
why disturb her by a word which will bring the tender<lb>
cares and troubles that come soon enough to such conscientious<lb>
creatures as herself? If she loves you, time<lb>
will prove it; therefore, let the new affection spring and<lb>
ripen as your early friendship has done, and it will be all<lb>
the stronger for a summer's growth. Philip was rash,<lb>
and has to bear his trial now, and Laura shares it with<lb>
him. Be more generous, John; make <hi rend="italics">your</hi> trial, bear<lb>
<hi rend="italics">your</hi> doubts alone, and give Nan the happiness without<lb>
<pb n="278">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-295">

<figdesc>Page 278.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the pain. Promise me this, dear, &mdash; promise me to hope<lb>
and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man's eye kindled, and in his heart there<lb>
rose a better chivalry, a truer valor, than any Di's<lb>
knights had ever known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll try, mother,&rdquo; was all he said; but she was satisfied,<lb>
for John seldom tried in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls, how splendid you are! It does my heart<lb>
good to see my handsome sisters in their best array,&rdquo;<lb>
cried Nan, one mild October night, as she put the last<lb>
touches to certain airy raiment fashioned by her own<lb>
skilful hands, and then fell back to survey the grand effect.</p>
<p>Di and Laura were preparing to assist at an &ldquo;event<lb>
of the season,&rdquo; and Nan, with her own locks fallen on<lb>
her shoulders for want of sundry combs promoted to her<lb>
sisters' heads, and her dress in unwonted disorder for lack<lb>
of the many pins extracted in exciting crises of the toilet,<lb>
hovered like an affectionate bee about two very full-blown<lb>
flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura looks like a cool Undine, with the ivy-wreaths<lb>
in her shining hair; and Di has illuminated herself to<lb>
such an extent with those scarlet leaves, that I don't<lb>
know what great creature she resembles most,&rdquo; said Nan,<lb>
beaming with sisterly admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juno, Zenobia and Cleopatra simmered into one,<lb>
with a touch of Xantippe, by way of spice. But, to my<lb>
eye, the finest woman of the three is the dishevelled<lb>
young person embracing the bed-post; for she stays at<lb>
home herself, and gives her time and taste to making<lb>
homely people fine, &mdash; which is a waste of good material,<lb>
and an imposition on the public.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="279">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-296">

<figdesc>Page 279.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>As Di spoke, both the fashion-plates looked affectionately<lb>
at the gray-gowned figure; but, being works of<lb>
art, they were obliged to nip their feelings in the bud,<lb>
and reserve their caresses till they returned to common<lb>
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on your bonnet, and we'll leave you at Mrs.<lb>
Lord's on our way. It will do you good, Nan; and perhaps<lb>
there may be news from John,&rdquo; added Di, as she<lb>
bore down upon the door like a man-of-war under full<lb>
sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or from Philip,&rdquo; sighed Laura, with a wistful look.</p>
<p>Whereupon Nan persuaded herself that her strong<lb>
inclination to sit down was owing to want of exercise,<lb>
and the heaviness of her eyelids a freak of imagination;<lb>
so, speedily smoothing her ruffled plumage, she ran down<lb>
to tell her father of the new arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, my dear, by all means. I shall be writing, and<lb>
you will be lonely if you stay. But I must see my girls;<lb>
for I caught glimpses of certain surprising phantoms flitting<lb>
by the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan led the way, and the two pyramids revolved<lb>
before him with the rigidity of lay-figures, much to the<lb>
good man's edification; for with his fatherly pleasure<lb>
there was mingled much mild wonderment at the amplitude<lb>
of array.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see my geese are really swans, though there<lb>
is such a cloud between us that I feel a long way off, and<lb>
hardly know them. But this little daughter is always<lb>
available, always my `cricket on the hearth.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>As he spoke, her father drew Nan closer, kissed her<lb>
tranquil face, and smiled content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if ever I see picters, I see 'em now, and I<lb>
<pb n="280">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-297">

<figdesc>Page 280.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
declare to goodness it's as interestin' as play-actin', every<lb>
bit. Miss Di, with all them boughs in her head, looks<lb>
like the Queen of Sheby, when she went a-visitin' What's-his-name;<lb>
and if Miss Laura ain't as sweet as a lallybarster<lb>
figger, I should like to know what is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her enthusiasm, Sally gambolled about the girls,<lb>
flourishing her milk-pan as if about to sound her timbrel<lb>
for excess of joy.</p>
<p>Laughing merrily, the two girls bestowed themselves<lb>
in the family ark, Nan got up beside Patrick, and Solon,<lb>
roused from his slumbers, morosely trundled them away.<lb>
But, looking backward with a last &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; Nan<lb>
saw her father still standing at the door with smiling<lb>
countenance, and the moonlight falling like a benediction<lb>
on his silver hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betsey shall go up the hill with you, my dear, and<lb>
here's a basket of eggs for your father. Give him my<lb>
love, and be sure you let me know the next time he is<lb>
poorly,&rdquo; Mrs. Lord said, when her guest rose to depart,<lb>
after an hour of pleasant chat.</p>
<p>But Nan never got the gift; for, to her great dismay,<lb>
her hostess dropped the basket with a crash, and flew<lb>
across the room to meet a tall figure pausing in the<lb>
shadow of the door. There was no need to ask who the<lb>
new-comer was; for, even in his mother's arms, John<lb>
looked over her shoulder with an eager nod to Nan, who<lb>
stood among the ruins with never a sign of weariness in<lb>
her face, nor the memory of a care at her heart, &mdash; for<lb>
they all went out when John came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell us how, and why, and when you came.<lb>
Take off your coat, my dear! And here are the old<lb>
<pb n="281">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-298">

<figdesc>Page 281.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
slippers. Why didn't you let us know you were coming<lb>
so soon? How have you been? and what makes you so<lb>
late to-night? Betsey, you needn't put on your bonnet.<lb>
And &mdash; oh, my dear boy, <hi rend="italics">have</hi> you been to supper<lb>
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lord was a quiet soul, and her flood of questions<lb>
was purred softly in her son's ear; for, being a woman,<lb>
she <hi rend="italics">must</hi> talk, and, being a mother, <hi rend="italics">must</hi> pet the one<lb>
delight of her life, and make a little festival when the<lb>
lord of the manor came home. A whole drove of fatted<lb>
calves were metaphorically killed, and a banquet appeared<lb>
with speed. John was not one of those romantic<lb>
heroes who can go through three volumes of hair-breadth<lb>
escapes without the faintest hint of that blessed institution,<lb>
dinner; therefore, he partook copiously of everything,<lb>
while the two women beamed over each mouthful<lb>
with an interest that enhanced its flavor, and urged upon<lb>
him cold meat and cheese, pickles and pie, as if dyspepsia<lb>
and nightmare were among the lost arts.</p>
<p>Then he opened his budget of news and fed <hi rend="italics">them.</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming next month, according to custom; but<lb>
Philip fell upon and so tempted me, that I was driven to<lb>
sacrifice myself to the cause of friendship, and up we<lb>
came to-night. He would not let me come here till we<lb>
had seen your father, Nan; for the poor lad was pining<lb>
for Laura, and hoped his good behavior for the past year<lb>
would satisfy his judge and secure his recall. We had<lb>
a fine talk with your father; and, upon my life, Phil<lb>
seemed to have received the gift of tongues, for he made<lb>
a most eloquent plea, which I've stowed away for future<lb>
use, I assure you. The dear old gentleman was very<lb>
kind, told Phil he was satisfied with the success of his<lb>
<pb n="282">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-299">

<figdesc>Page 282.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
probation, that he should see Laura when he liked, and,<lb>
if all went well, should receive his reward in the spring.<lb>
It must be a delightful sensation to know you have made<lb>
a fellow-creature as happy as those words made Phil<lb>
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John paused, and looked musingly at the matronly<lb>
tea-pot, as if he saw a wondrous future in its shine.</p>
<p>Nan twinkled off the drops that rose at the thought of<lb>
Laura's joy, and said, with grateful warmth, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say nothing of your own share in the making<lb>
of that happiness, John; but we know it, for Philip has<lb>
told Laura in his letters all that you have been to him,<lb>
and I am sure there was other eloquence beside his own<lb>
before father granted all you say he has. Oh, John, I<lb>
thank you very much for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lord beamed a whole midsummer of delight<lb>
upon her son, as she saw the pleasure these words gave<lb>
him, though he answered simply, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only tried to be a brother to him, Nan; for he has<lb>
been most kind to me. Yes, I said my little say to-night,<lb>
and gave my testimony in behalf of the prisoner at the<lb>
bar, a most merciful judge pronounced his sentence, and<lb>
he rushed straight to Mrs. Leigh's to tell Laura the blissful<lb>
news. Just imagine the scene when he appears, and<lb>
how Di will open her wicked eyes and enjoy the spectacle<lb>
of the ardent lover, the bride-elect's tears, the stir,<lb>
and the romance of the thing. She'll cry over it to-night,<lb>
and caricature it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And John led the laugh at the picture he had conjured<lb>
up, to turn the thoughts of Di's dangerous sister from<lb>
himself.</p>
<p>At ten Nan retired into the depths of her old bonnet<lb>
<pb n="283">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-300">

<figdesc>Page 283.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with a far different face from the one she brought out of<lb>
it, and John, resuming his hat, mounted guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't stay late, remember, John!&rdquo; And in Mrs.<lb>
Lord's voice there was a warning tone that her son interpreted<lb>
aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll not forget, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he kept his word; for though Philip's happiness<lb>
floated temptingly before him, and the little figure at his<lb>
side had never seemed so dear, he ignored the bland<lb>
winds, the tender night, and set a seal upon his lips,<lb>
thinking manfully within himself, &ldquo;I see many signs of<lb>
promise in her happy face; but I will wait and hope a<lb>
little longer for her sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is father, Sally?&rdquo; asked Nan, as that functionary<lb>
appeared, blinking owlishly, but utterly repudiating<lb>
the idea of sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went down the garding, miss, when the gentlemen<lb>
cleared, bein' a little flustered by the goin's on.<lb>
Shall I fetch him in?&rdquo; asked Sally, as irreverently as if<lb>
her master were a bag of meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we will go ourselves.&rdquo; And slowly the two<lb>
paced down the leaf-strewn walk.</p>
<p>Fields of yellow grain were waving on the hill-side,<lb>
and sere corn-blades rustled in the wind; from the orchard<lb>
came the scent of ripening fruit, and all the garden-plots<lb>
lay ready to yield up their humble offerings to their master's<lb>
hand. But in the silence of the night a greater<lb>
Reaper had passed by, gathering in the harvest of a<lb>
righteous life, and leaving only tender memories for the<lb>
gleaners who had come so late.</p>
<p>The old man sat in the shadow of the tree his own<lb>
<pb n="284">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-301">

<figdesc>Page 284.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hands planted; its fruitful boughs shone ruddily, and its<lb>
leaves still whispered the low lullaby that hushed him to<lb>
his rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fast he sleeps! Poor father! I should have<lb>
come before and made it pleasant for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Nan lifted up the head bent down upon<lb>
his breast, and kissed his pallid cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, this is not sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, the happiest he will ever know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the shadows flickered over three white<lb>
faces, and the silence deepened solemnly. Then John<lb>
reverently bore the pale shape in, and Nan dropped down<lb>
beside it, saying, with a rain of grateful tears, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kissed me when I went, and said a last `goodnight!&rdquo;'<lb>
</p>
<p>For an hour steps went to and fro about her, many<lb>
voices whispered near her, and skilful hands touched the<lb>
beloved clay she held so fast; but one by one the busy<lb>
feet passed out, one by one the voices died away, and<lb>
human skill proved vain. Then Mrs. Lord drew the<lb>
orphan to the shelter of her arms, soothing her with the<lb>
mute solace of that motherly embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are poorer than we thought; but when<lb>
everything is settled, we shall get on very well. We<lb>
can let a part of this great house, and live quietly together<lb>
until spring; then Laura will be married, and Di can go<lb>
on their travels with them, as Philip wishes her to do.<lb>
We shall be cared for; so never fear for us, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan said this, as her friend parted from her a week<lb>
later, after the saddest holiday he had ever known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what becomes of you, Nan?&rdquo; he asked, watching<lb>
the patient eyes that smiled when others would<lb>
have wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stay in the dear old house; for no other<lb>
place would seem like home to me. I shall find some little<lb>
child to love and care for, and be quite happy till the<lb>
girls come back and want me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John nodded wisely, as he listened, and went away<lb>
prophesying within himself, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall find something more than a child to love;<lb>
and, God willing, shall be very happy till the girls come<lb>
home and &mdash; cannot have her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan's plan was carried into effect. Slowly the divided<lb>
waters closed again, and the three fell back into their old<lb>
life. But the touch of sorrow drew them closer; and,<lb>
though invisible, a beloved presence still moved among<lb>
them, a familiar voice still spoke to them in the silence<lb>
of their softened hearts. Thus the soil was made ready,<lb>
and in the depth of winter the good seed was sown, was<lb>
watered with many tears, and soon sprang up green with<lb>
the promise of a harvest for their after years.</p>
<p>Di and Laura consoled themselves with their favorite<lb>
employments, unconscious that Nan was growing paler,<lb>
thinner, and more silent, as the weeks went by, till one<lb>
day she dropped quietly before them, and it suddenly<lb>
became manifest that she was utterly worn out with<lb>
many cares, and the secret suffering of a tender heart<lb>
bereft of the paternal love which had been its strength<lb>
and stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm only tired, dear girls. Don't be troubled, for I<lb>
<pb n="286">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-303">

<figdesc>Page 286.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
shall be up to-morrow,&rdquo; she said cheerily, as she looked<lb>
into the anxious faces bending over her.</p>
<p>But the weariness was of many months' growth, and<lb>
it was weeks before that &ldquo;to-morrow&rdquo; came.</p>
<p>Laura installed herself as nurse, and her devotion was<lb>
repaid fourfold; for, sitting at her sister's bedside, she<lb>
learned a finer art than that she had left. Her eye grew<lb>
clear to see the beauty of a self-denying life, and in the<lb>
depths of Nan's meek nature she found the strong,<lb>
sweet virtues that made her what she was.</p>
<p>Then remembering that these womanly attributes were<lb>
a bride's best dowry, Laura gave herself to their attainment,<lb>
that she might become to another household the<lb>
blessing Nan had been to her own; and turning from the<lb>
worship of the goddess Beauty, she gave her hand to<lb>
that humbler and more human teacher, Duty, &mdash; learning<lb>
her lessons with a willing heart, for Philip's sake.</p>
<p>Di corked her inkstand, locked her bookcase, and went<lb>
at housework as if it were a five-barred gate; of course<lb>
she missed the leap, but scrambled bravely through, and<lb>
appeared much sobered by the exercise. Sally had<lb>
departed to sit under a vine and fig-tree of her own, so<lb>
Di had undisputed sway; but if dish-pans and dusters<lb>
had tongues, direful would have been the history of that<lb>
crusade against frost and fire, indolence and inexperience.<lb>
But they were dumb, and Di scorned to complain, though<lb>
her struggles were pathetic to behold, and her sisters<lb>
went through a series of messes equal to a course of<lb>
&ldquo;Prince Bedreddin's&rdquo; peppery tarts. Reality turned<lb>
Romance out of doors; for, unlike her favorite heroines<lb>
in satin and tears, or helmet and shield, Di met her fate<lb>
in a big checked apron and dust-cap wonderful to see;<lb>
<pb n="287">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-304">

<figdesc>Page 287.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
yet she wielded her broom as stoutly as &ldquo;Moll Flanders&rdquo;<lb>
shouldered her gun, and marched to her daily martyrdom<lb>
in the kitchen with as heroic a heart as the &ldquo;Maid of<lb>
Orleans&rdquo; took to <hi rend="italics">her</hi> stake.</p>
<p>Mind won the victory over matter in the end, and Di<lb>
was better all her days for the tribulations and the triumphs<lb>
of that time; for she drowned her idle fancies in<lb>
her wash-tub, made burnt-offerings of selfishness and<lb>
pride, and learned the worth of self-denial, as she sang<lb>
with happy voice among the pots and kettles of her conquered<lb>
realm.</p>
<p>Nan thought of John; and in the stillness of her<lb>
sleepless nights prayed Heaven to keep him safe, and<lb>
make her worthy to receive, and strong enough to bear,<lb>
the blessedness or pain of love.</p>
<p>Snow fell without, and keen winds howled among the<lb>
leafless elms, but &ldquo;herbs of grace&rdquo; were blooming beautifully<lb>
in the sunshine of sincere endeavor, and this<lb>
dreariest season proved the most fruitful of the year; for<lb>
love taught Laura, labor chastened Di, and patience<lb>
fitted Nan for the blessing of her life.</p>
<p>Nature, that stillest yet most diligent of housewives,<lb>
began at last that &ldquo;spring-cleaning&rdquo; which she makes<lb>
so pleasant that none find the heart to grumble as they<lb>
do when other matrons set their premises a-dust. Her<lb>
handmaids, wind and rain and sun, swept, washed, and<lb>
garnished busily, green carpets were unrolled, appleboughs<lb>
were hung with draperies of bloom, and dandelions,<lb>
pet nurslings of the year, came out to play upon<lb>
the sward.</p>
<p>From the South returned that opera troupe whose manager<lb>
is never in despair, whose tenor never sulks, whose<lb>

prima donna never fails, and in the orchard <hi rend="italics">bona fide<lb>
matin&eacute;es</hi> were held, to which buttercups and clovers<lb>
crowded in their prettiest spring hats, and verdant young<lb>
blades twinkled their dewy lorgnettes, as they bowed<lb>
and made way for the floral belles.</p>
<p>May was bidding June good-morrow, and the roses<lb>
were just dreaming that it was almost time to wake,<lb>
when John came again into the quiet room which now<lb>
seemed the Eden that contained his Eve. Of course<lb>
there was a jubilee; but something seemed to have befallen<lb>
the whole group, for never had they all appeared<lb>
in such odd frames of mind.</p>
<p>John was restless, and wore an excited look, most<lb>
unlike his usual serenity of aspect. Nan the cheerful<lb>
had fallen into a well of silence, and was not to be extracted<lb>
by any hydraulic power, though she smiled like<lb>
the June sky over her head. Di's peculiarities were out<lb>
in full force, and she looked as if she would go off like a<lb>
torpedo at a touch; but through all her moods there was<lb>
a half-triumphant, half-remorseful expression in the<lb>
glance she fixed on John. And Laura, once so silent,<lb>
now sang like a blackbird, as she flitted to and fro; but<lb>
her fitful song was always, &ldquo;Philip, my king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John felt that there had come a change upon the three,<lb>
and silently divined whose unconscious influence had<lb>
wrought the miracle. The embargo was off his tongue,<lb>
and he was in a fever to ask that question which brings<lb>
a flutter to the stoutest heart; but though the &ldquo;man&rdquo; had<lb>
come, the &ldquo;hour&rdquo; had not. So, by way of steadying his<lb>
nerves, he paced the room, pausing often to take notes of<lb>
his companions, and each pause seemed to increase his<lb>
wonder and content.</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="19">
<p>He looked at Nan. She was in her usual place, the<lb>
shabby little chair she loved, because it once was large<lb>
enough to hold a curly-headed playmate and herself. The<lb>
old work-basket was at her side, and the battered thimble<lb>
busily at work; but her lips wore a smile they had never<lb>
worn before, the color of the unblown roses touched her<lb>
cheek, and her downcast eyes were full of light.</p>
<p>He looked at Di. The inevitable book was on her<lb>
knee, but its leaves were uncut; the strong-minded knob<lb>
of hair still asserted its supremacy aloft upon her head,<lb>
and the triangular jacket still adorned her shoulders in<lb>
defiance of all fashions, past, present, or to come; but<lb>
the expression of her brown countenance had grown<lb>
softer, her tongue had found a curb, and in her hand lay<lb>
a card with &ldquo;Potts, Kettel &amp; Co.&rdquo; inscribed thereon,<lb>
which she regarded with never a scornful word for<lb>
the &ldquo;Co.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Laura. She was before her easel, as of<lb>
old; but the pale nun had given place to a blooming girl,<lb>
who sang at her work, which was no prim Pallas, but a<lb>
Clytie turning her human face to meet the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, what are you thinking of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stirred as if Di's voice had disturbed his fancy at<lb>
some pleasant pastime, but answered with his usual sincerity, &mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of a certain dear old fairy tale, called<lb>
`Cinderella.' &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Di; and her &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; was a most impressive<lb>
monosyllable. &ldquo;I see the meaning of your smile now;<lb>
and, though the application of the story is not very complimentary<lb>
to all parties concerned, it is very just and<lb>
very true.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="290">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-307">

<figdesc>Page 290.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>She paused a moment, then went on with softened<lb>
voice and earnest face, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I am a blind and selfish creature. So I<lb>
am, but not so blind and selfish as I have been; for<lb>
many tears have cleared my eyes, and sincere regret has<lb>
made me humbler than I was. I have found a better<lb>
book than any father's library can give me, and I have<lb>
read it with a love and admiration that grew stronger as<lb>
I turned the leaves. Henceforth I take it for my guide<lb>
and gospel, and, looking back upon the selfish and<lb>
neglectful past, can only say, Heaven bless your dear<lb>
heart, Nan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura echoed Di's last words; for, with eyes as full<lb>
of tenderness, she looked down upon the sister she had<lb>
lately learned to know, saying, warmly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, `Heaven bless your dear heart, Nan!' I never<lb>
can forget all you have been to me; and when I am far<lb>
away with Philip, there will always be one countenance<lb>
more beautiful to me than any pictured face I may discover,<lb>
there will be one place more dear to me than<lb>
Rome. The face will be yours, Nan, &mdash; always so patient,<lb>
always so serene; and the dearer place will be this<lb>
home of ours, which you have made so pleasant to me<lb>
all these years by kindnesses as numberless and noiseless<lb>
as the drops of dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, girls, what have I ever done, that you should<lb>
love me so?&rdquo; cried Nan, with happy wonderment, as the<lb>
tall heads, black and golden, bent to meet the lowly<lb>
brown one; and her sisters' mute lips answered her.</p>
<p>Then Laura looked up, saying, playfully, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the good and wicked sisters; where shall<lb>
we find the Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="291">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-308">

<figdesc>Page 291.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Di, pointing to John; and then her<lb>
secret went off like a rocket; for, with her old impetuosity,<lb>
she said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found you out, John, and am ashamed to look<lb>
you in the face, remembering the past. Girls, you know,<lb>
when father died, John sent us money, which he said<lb>
Mr. Owen had long owed us, and had paid at last! It<lb>
was a kind lie, John, and a generous thing to do; for we<lb>
needed it, but never would have taken it as a gift. I<lb>
know you meant that we should never find this out; but<lb>
yesterday I met Mr. Owen returning from the West,<lb>
and when I thanked him for a piece of justice we had<lb>
not expected of him, he gruffly told me he had never<lb>
paid the debt, never meant to pay it, for it was outlawed,<lb>
and we could not claim a farthing. John, I have laughed<lb>
at you, thought you stupid, treated you unkindly; but I<lb>
know you now, and never shall forget the lesson you<lb>
have taught me. I am proud as Lucifer, but I ask you<lb>
to forgive me, and I seal my real repentance so &mdash; and<lb>
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With tragic countenance, Di rushed across the room,<lb>
threw both arms about the astonished young man's neck,<lb>
and dropped an energetic kiss upon his cheek. There<lb>
was a momentary silence; for Di finely illustrated her<lb>
strong-minded theories by crying like the weakest of her<lb>
sex. Laura, with &ldquo;the ruling passion strong in death,&rdquo;<lb>
still tried to draw, but broke her pet crayon, and endowed<lb>
her Clytie with a supplementary orb, owing to the<lb>
dimness of her own. And Nan sat, with drooping eyes<lb>
that shone upon her work, thinking, with tender pride, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know him now, and love him for his generous<lb>
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="292">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-309">

<figdesc>Page 292.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Di spoke first, rallying to her colors, though a little<lb>
daunted by her loss of self-control:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't laugh, John &mdash; I couldn't help it; and don't<lb>
think I'm not sincere, for I am, &mdash; I am! and I will<lb>
prove it by growing good enough to be your friend.<lb>
That debt must all be paid, and I shall do it; for I'll<lb>
turn my books and pen to some account, and write stories<lb>
full of dear old souls like you and Nan; and some<lb>
one, I know, will like and buy them, though they are not<lb>
`works of Shakspeare.' I've thought of this before,<lb>
have felt I had the power in me; <hi rend="italics">now</hi> I have the motive,<lb>
and <hi rend="italics">now</hi> I'll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Di had proposed to translate the Koran, or build a<lb>
new Saint Paul's, there would have been many chances<lb>
of success; for, once moved, her will, like a batteringram,<lb>
would knock down the obstacles her wits could not<lb>
surmount. John believed in her most heartily, and<lb>
showed it, as he answered, looking into her resolute<lb>
face, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will, and yet make us very proud of our<lb>
Di. Let the money lie, and when you have made a fortune,<lb>
I'll claim it with enormous interest; but, believe<lb>
me, I feel already doubly repaid by the esteem so generously<lb>
confessed, so cordially bestowed, and can only say,<lb>
as we used to years ago, &mdash; `Now let's forgive and forget.' &rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>But proud Di would not let him add to her obligation,<lb>
even by returning her impetuous salute; she slipped<lb>
away, and, shaking off the last drops, answered, with a<lb>
curious mixture of old freedom and new respect, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more sentiment, please, John. We know each<lb>
other now; and when I find a friend, I never let him go.<lb>
<pb n="293">

</eaffig>
We have smoked the pipe of peace; so let us go back to<lb>
our wigwams and bury the hatchet. Where were we<lb>
when I lost my head? and what were we talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cinderella and the Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, John's eye kindled, and, turning, he<lb>
looked down at Nan, who sat diligently ornamenting<lb>
with microscopic stitches a great patch going on, the<lb>
wrong side out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &mdash; so we were; and now, taking pussy for the<lb>
godmother, the characters of the story are well personated&mdash;<lb>
all but the slipper,&rdquo; said Di, laughing, as she<lb>
thought of the many times they had played it together<lb>
years ago.</p>
<p>A sudden warmth stirred John's heart, a sudden<lb>
purpose shone in his countenance, and a sudden change<lb>
befell his voice, as he said, producing from some hidingplace<lb>
a little worn-out shoe, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can supply the slipper; &mdash; who will try it first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Di's black eyes opened wide, as they fell on the<lb>
familiar object; then her romance-loving nature saw the<lb>
whole plot of that drama which needs but two to act it.<lb>
A great delight flushed up into her face, as she promptly<lb>
took her cue, saying, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need for us to try it, Laura; for it wouldn't fit<lb>
us, if our feet were as small as Chinese dolls'; &mdash; our<lb>
parts are played out; therefore, `Exeunt wicked sisters to<lb>
the music of the wedding-bells.' &rdquo; And pouncing upon<lb>
the dismayed artist, she swept her out, and closed the<lb>
door with a triumphant bang.</p>
<p>John went to Nan, and, dropping on his knee as reverently<lb>
as the herald of the fairy tale, he asked, still<lb>
smiling, but with lips grown tremulous, &mdash;</p>
<pb n="294">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-311">

<figdesc>Page 294.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Cinderella try the little shoe, and, &mdash; if it fits, &mdash;<lb>
go with the Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nan only covered up her face, weeping happy<lb>
tears, while all the weary work strayed down upon the<lb>
floor, as if it knew her holiday had come.</p>
<p>John drew the hidden face still closer; and, while she<lb>
listened to his eager words, Nan heard the beating of the<lb>
strong man's heart, and knew it spoke the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan, I promised mother to be silent till I was sure<lb>
I loved you wholly, &mdash; sure that the knowledge would<lb>
give no pain when I should tell it, as I am trying to tell<lb>
it now. This little shoe has been my comforter through<lb>
this long year, and I have kept it as other lovers keep<lb>
their fairer favors. It has been a talisman more eloquent<lb>
to me than flower or ring; for, when I saw how worn it<lb>
was, I always thought of the willing feet that came and<lb>
went for others' comfort all day long; when I saw the<lb>
little bow you tied, I always thought of the hands so<lb>
diligent in serving any one who knew a want or felt a<lb>
pain; and when I recalled the gentle creature who had<lb>
worn it last, I always saw her patient, tender, and<lb>
devout, &mdash; and tried to grow more worthy of her, that I<lb>
might one day dare to ask if she would walk beside me<lb>
all my life, and be my `angel in the house.' Will you,<lb>
dear? Believe me, you shall never know a weariness or<lb>
grief I have the power to shield you from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Nan, as simple in her love as in her life, laid her<lb>
arms about his neck, her happy face against his own,<lb>
and answered softly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, I never can be sad or tired any more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>DON'T bring him in here; every corner is full,&rdquo; said<lb>
the nurse, eying with dismay the gaunt figure lying<lb>
on the stretcher in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <hi rend="italics">shall</hi> we put him, then? They can't have<lb>
him in either of the other wards on this floor. He's<lb>
ordered up here, and here he must stay, if he's put in the<lb>
hall, poor devil!&rdquo; said the foremost bearer, looking<lb>
around the crowded room in despair.</p>
<p>The nurse's eye followed his, and both saw a thin hand<lb>
beckoning from the end of the long ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's Murry; I'll see what he wants;&rdquo; and Miss<lb>
Mercy went to him with her quick, noiseless step, and<lb>
the smile her grave face always wore for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's room here, if you turn my bed 'round, you<lb>
see. Don't let them leave him in the hall,&rdquo; said Murry,<lb>
lifting his great eyes to hers, brilliant with the fever<lb>
burning his strength away, and pathetic with the silent<lb>
protest of life against death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's like you to think of it; he's a rebel,&rdquo; began<lb>
Miss Mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much more reason to take him in. I don't mind<lb>
having him here; but it will distress me dreadfully to<lb>
know that any poor soul was turned away, from the comfort<lb>
of this ward especially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The look he gave her made the words an eloquent<lb>
compliment, and his pity for a fallen enemy reproached<lb>
her for her own lack of it. Her face softened as she<lb>
nodded, and glanced about the recess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have the light in your eyes, and only the<lb>
little table between you and a very disagreeable neighbor,&rdquo;<lb>
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can shut my eyes if the light troubles them; I've<lb>
nothing else to do now,&rdquo; he answered, with a faint laugh.<lb>
&ldquo;I was too comfortable before; I'd more than my share<lb>
of luxuries; so bring him along, and it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order was given, and, after a brief bustle, the two<lb>
narrow beds stood side by side in the recess under the<lb>
organ-loft &mdash; for the hospital had been a church. Left<lb>
alone for a moment, the two men eyed each other silently.<lb>
Murry saw a tall, sallow man, with fierce black eyes,<lb>
wild hair and beard, and a thin-lipped, cruel mouth. A<lb>
ragged gray uniform was visible under the blanket<lb>
thrown over him; and in strange contrast to the squalor<lb>
of his dress, and the neglect of his person, was the<lb>
diamond ring that shone on his unwounded hand. The<lb>
right arm was bound up, the right leg amputated at the<lb>
knee; and, though the man's face was white and haggard<lb>
with suffering, not a sound escaped him as he lay with<lb>
his eyes fixed half defiantly upon his neighbor.</p>
<p>John Clay, the new-comer, saw opposite him a small,<lb>
wasted figure, and a plain face; yet both face and figure<lb>
were singularly attractive, for suffering seemed to have<lb>
refined away all the grosser elements, and left the spiritual<lb>
very visible through that frail tenement of flesh.<lb>
Pale-brown hair streaked the hollow temples and white<lb>
forehead. A deep color burned in the thin cheeks still<lb>

tanned by the wind and weather of a long campaign.<lb>
The mouth was grave and sweet, and in the gray eyes<lb>
lay an infinite patience touched with melancholy. He<lb>
wore a dressing-gown, but across his feet lay a faded<lb>
coat of army-blue. As the other watched him, he saw a<lb>
shadow pass across his tranquil face, and for a moment<lb>
he laid his wasted hand over the eyes that had been so<lb>
full of pity. Then he gently pushed a mug of fresh<lb>
water, and the last of a bunch of grapes, toward the<lb>
exhausted rebel, saying, in a cordial tone, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look faint and thirsty; have 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay's lips were parched, and his hand went involuntarily<lb>
toward the cup; but he caught it back, and, leaning<lb>
forward, asked, in a shrill whisper, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shot in the side,&rdquo; answered Murry, visibly surprised<lb>
at the man's manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm dying of wound-fever; there's no hope, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That reply, so simple, so serenely given, would have<lb>
touched almost any hearer; but Clay smiled grimly, and<lb>
lay down as if satisfied, with his one hand clenched, and<lb>
an exulting glitter in his eyes, muttering to himself, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loss of my leg comes easier after hearing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murry saw his lips move, but caught no sound, and<lb>
asked, with friendly solicitude, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want anything, neighbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &mdash; to be let alone,&rdquo; was the curt reply, with a<lb>
savage frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's easily done. I sha'n't trouble you very long,<lb>
<pb n="298">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-317">

<figdesc>Page 298.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
any way;&rdquo; and, with a sigh, Murry turned his face<lb>
away, and lay silent till the surgeon came up on his<lb>
morning round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you're here, are you? It's like Mercy Carrol<lb>
to take you in,&rdquo; said Dr. Fitz Hugh, as he surveyed the<lb>
rebel, with a slight frown; for, in spite of his benevolence<lb>
and skill, he was a stanch loyalist, and hated the<lb>
South just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't praise me; he never would have been here but<lb>
for Murry,&rdquo; answered Miss Mercy, as she approached,<lb>
with her dressing-tray in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the lad! he'll give up his bed next, and feel<lb>
offended if he's thanked for it. How are you, my good<lb>
fellow?&rdquo; and the doctor turned to press the hot hand,<lb>
with a friendly face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much easier and stronger, thank you, doctor,&rdquo; was<lb>
the cheerful answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less fever, pulse better, breath freer &mdash; good symptoms.<lb>
Keep on so for twenty-four hours, and, by my<lb>
soul, I believe you'll have a chance for your life, Murry,&rdquo;<lb>
cried the doctor, as his experienced eye took note of a<lb>
hopeful change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of the opinion of three good surgeons to the<lb>
contrary?&rdquo; asked Murry, with a wistful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang everybody's opinion! We are but mortal men,<lb>
and the best of us make mistakes in spite of science and<lb>
experience. There's Parker; we all gave him up, and<lb>
the rascal is larking 'round Washington as well as ever<lb>
to-day. While there's life there's hope; so cheer up<lb>
my lad, and do your best for the little girl at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think I may hope?&rdquo; cried Murry,<lb>
white with the joy of this unexpected reprieve.</p>
<pb n="299">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-318">

<figdesc>Page 299.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope is a capital medicine, and I prescribe it for a<lb>
day at least. Don't build on this change too much, but<lb>
if you are as well to-morrow as this morning, I give you<lb>
my word I think you'll pull through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murry laid his hands over his face with a broken<lb>
&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; and the doctor turned away<lb>
with a sonorous &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; and an air of intense satisfaction.<lb>
</p>
<p>During this conversation Miss Mercy had been watching<lb>
the rebel, who looked and listened to the others so<lb>
intently that he forgot her presence. She saw an expression<lb>
of rage and disappointment gather in his face as the<lb>
doctor spoke; and when Murry accepted the hope held<lb>
out to him, Clay set his teeth with an evil look, that would<lb>
have boded ill for his neighbor had he not been helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ungrateful traitor! I'll watch him, for he'll do mischief<lb>
if he can,&rdquo; she thought, and reluctantly began to<lb>
unbind his arm for the doctor's inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a flesh-wound, &mdash; no bones broken, &mdash; a good<lb>
syringing, rubber cushion, plenty of water, and it will<lb>
soon heal. You'll attend to that, Miss Mercy; this<lb>
stump is more in my line;&rdquo; and Dr. Fitz Hugh turned<lb>
to the leg, leaving the arm to the nurse's skilful care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently amputated in a hurry, and neglected since.<lb>
If you're not careful, young man, you'll change places<lb>
with your neighbor here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn him!&rdquo; muttered Clay in his beard, with an<lb>
emphasis which caused the doctor to glance at his vengeful<lb>
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be a brute, if you can help it. But for him<lb>
you'd have fared ill,&rdquo; began the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for him I never should have been here,&rdquo; muttered<lb>
<pb n="300">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-319">

<figdesc>Page 300.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the man, in French, with a furtive glance about the<lb>
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You owe this to him?&rdquo; asked the doctor, touching<lb>
the wound, and speaking in the same tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but he paid for it&mdash; at least, I thought he had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Lord! if you are the sneaking rascal that<lb>
shot him as he lay wounded in the ambulance, I shall be<lb>
tempted to leave you to your fate!&rdquo; cried the doctor,<lb>
with a wrathful flash in his keen eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it, then, for it was I,&rdquo; answered the man defiantly;<lb>
adding, as if anxious to explain, &ldquo;We had a tussle,<lb>
and each got hurt in the thick of the skirmish. He<lb>
was put in the ambulance afterward, and I was left to<lb>
live or die, as luck would have it. I was hurt the<lb>
worst; they should have taken me too; it made me mad<lb>
to see him chosen, and I fired my last shot as he drove<lb>
away. I didn't know whether I hit him or not; but<lb>
when they told me I must lose my leg I hoped I had,<lb>
and now I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke rapidly, with clenched hand and fiery eyes,<lb>
and the two listeners watched him with a sort of fascination<lb>
as he hissed out the last words, glancing at the occupant<lb>
of the next bed. Murry evidently did not understand<lb>
French; he lay with averted face, closed eyes, and a hopeful<lb>
smile still on his lips, quite unconscious of the meaning<lb>
of the fierce words uttered close beside him. Dr. Fitz Hugh<lb>
had laid down his instruments, and knit his black brows<lb>
irefully while he listened. But as the man paused, the<lb>
doctor looked at Miss Mercy, who was quietly going on<lb>
with her work, though there was an expression about her<lb>
handsome mouth that made her womanly face look almost<lb>
<pb n="301">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-320">

<figdesc>Page 301.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
grim. Taking up his tools, the doctor followed her<lb>
example, saying slowly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn't believe Murry was mending, I'd turn you<lb>
over to Roberts, whom the patients dread as they do the<lb>
devil. I must do my duty, and you may thank Murry<lb>
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know you are the man who shot him?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Mercy, still in French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I shouldn't stay here long if he did,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Clay, with a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't tell him, then &mdash; at least, till after you are<lb>
moved,&rdquo; she said, in a tone of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I going?&rdquo; demanded the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere out of my ward,&rdquo; was the brief answer,<lb>
with a look that made the black eyes waver and fall.</p>
<p>In silence nurse and doctor did their work, and passed<lb>
on. In silence Murry lay hour after hour, and silently<lb>
did Clay watch and wait, till, utterly exhausted by the<lb>
suffering he was too proud to confess, he sank into a<lb>
stupor, oblivious alike of hatred, defeat, and pain. Finding<lb>
him in this pitiable condition, Mercy relented, and,<lb>
womanlike, forgot her contempt in pity. He was not<lb>
moved, but tended carefully all that day and night; and<lb>
when he woke from a heavy sleep, the morning sun shone<lb>
again on two pale faces in the beds, and flashed on the<lb>
buttons of two army-coats hanging side by side on the<lb>
recess wall, on loyalist and rebel, on the blue and the<lb>
gray.</p>
<p>Dr. Fitz Hugh stood beside Murry's cot, saying cheerily,<lb>
&ldquo;You are doing well, my lad &mdash; better than I hoped.<lb>
Keep calm and cool, and, if all goes right, we'll have little<lb>
Mary here to pet you in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="302">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-321">

<figdesc>Page 302.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who's Mary?&rdquo; whispered the rebel to the attendant<lb>
who was washing his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His sweetheart; he left her for the war, and she's<lb>
waitin' for him back &mdash; poor soul!&rdquo; answered the man,<lb>
with a somewhat vicious scrub across the sallow cheek<lb>
he was wiping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he'll get well, and go home and marry the girl<lb>
he left behind him, will he?&rdquo; sneered Clay, fingering a<lb>
little case that hung about his neck, and was now visible<lb>
as his rough valet unbuttoned his collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that, &mdash; your sweetheart's picter?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Jim, the attendant, eying the gold chain anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've got none,&rdquo; was the gruff answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the wus for you, then. Small chance of<lb>
gettin' one here; our girls won't look at you, and you<lb>
ain't likely to see any of your own sort for a long spell,<lb>
I reckon,&rdquo; added Jim, working away at the rebel's longneglected<lb>
hair.</p>
<p>Clay lay looking at Mercy Carrol as she went to and<lb>
fro among the men, leaving a smile behind her, and carrying<lb>
comfort wherever she turned, &mdash; a right womanly<lb>
woman, lovely and lovable, strong yet tender, patient<lb>
yet decided, skilful, kind, and tireless in the discharge of<lb>
duties that would have daunted most women. It was in<lb>
vain she wore the plain gray gown and long apron, for<lb>
neither could hide the grace of her figure. It was<lb>
in vain she brushed her luxuriant hair back into a net,<lb>
for the wavy locks would fall on her forehead, and stray<lb>
curls would creep out or glisten like gold under the<lb>
meshes meant to conceal them. Busy days and watchful<lb>
nights had not faded the beautiful bloom on her cheeks,<lb>
or dimmed the brightness of her hazel eyes. Always<lb>
<pb n="303">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-322">

<figdesc>Page 303.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
ready, fresh, and fair, Mercy Carrol was regarded as the<lb>
good angel of the hospital, and not a man in it, sick or<lb>
well, but was a loyal friend to her. None dared to be a<lb>
lover, for her little romance was known; and, though<lb>
still a maid, she was a widow in their eyes, for she had<lb>
sent her lover to his death, and over the brave man's<lb>
grave had said, &ldquo;Well done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim watched Clay as his eye followed the one female<lb>
figure there, and, observing that he clutched the case still<lb>
tighter, asked again, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that &mdash; a charm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &mdash; against pain, captivity and shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strikes me it a'n't kep' you from any one of 'em,&rdquo;<lb>
said Jim, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven't tried it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; Jim asked more respectfully,<lb>
being impressed by something in the rebel's manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see when I use it. Now let me alone;&rdquo;<lb>
and Clay turned impatiently away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've got p'ison, or some deviltry, in that thing.<lb>
If you don't let me look, I swear I'll have it took away<lb>
from you;&rdquo; and Jim put his big hand on the slender<lb>
chain with a resolute air.</p>
<p>Clay smiled a scornful smile, and offered the trinket,<lb>
saying coolly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only fooled you. Look as much as you like;<lb>
you'll find nothing dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim opened the pocket, saw a lock of gray hair, and<lb>
nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your mother's?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; my dead mother's.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was strange to see the instantaneous change that<lb>
<pb n="304">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-323">

<figdesc>Page 304.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
passed over the two men as each uttered that dearest<lb>
word in all tongues. Rough Jim gently reclosed and<lb>
returned the case, saying kindly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it; I wouldn't rob you on't for no money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay thrust it jealously into his breast, and the first<lb>
trace of emotion he had shown softened his dark face, as<lb>
he answered, with a grateful tremor in his voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I wouldn't lose it for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I say good-morning, neighbor?&rdquo; asked a feeble<lb>
voice, as Murry turned a very wan, but cheerful face<lb>
toward him, when Jim moved on with his basin and<lb>
towel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; returned Clay, looking at him with<lb>
those quick, suspicious eyes of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do like; so I say it, and hope you are<lb>
better,&rdquo; returned the cordial voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is sure, in a case like mine, till I'm on my<lb>
legs again; but I'm certainly better. I don't expect <hi rend="italics">you</hi><lb>
to be glad, but I hope you don't regret it very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't.&rdquo; The smile that accompanied the words<lb>
surprised Murry as much as the reply, for both seemed<lb>
honest, and his kind heart warmed toward his suffering<lb>
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you'll be exchanged as soon as you are able.<lb>
Till then, you can go to one of the other hospitals, where<lb>
there are many reb &mdash; I would say, Southerners. If<lb>
you'd like, I'll speak to Dr. Fitz Hugh, and he'll see you<lb>
moved,&rdquo; said Murry, in his friendly way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd rather stay here, thank you.&rdquo; Clay smiled again<lb>
<pb n="305">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-324">

<figdesc>Page 305.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="20">
as he spoke in the mild tone that surprised Murry as<lb>
much as it pleased him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like to be in my corner, then?&rdquo; he said, with a<lb>
boyish laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much &mdash; for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm very glad. Do you suffer much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall suffer more by and by, if I go on; but I'll<lb>
risk it,&rdquo; answered Clay, fixing his feverish eyes on<lb>
Murry's placid face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expect to have a hard time with your leg?&rdquo;<lb>
said Murry, compassionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an odd answer, and given with such an odd<lb>
expression, as Clay turned his face away, that Murry<lb>
said no more, fancying his brain a little touched by the<lb>
fever evidently coming on.</p>
<p>They spoke but seldom to each other that day, for<lb>
Clay lay apparently asleep, with a flushed cheek and<lb>
restless head, and Murry tranquilly dreamed waking<lb>
dreams of home and little Mary. That night, after all<lb>
was still, Miss Mercy went up into the organ-loft to get<lb>
fresh rollers for the morrow, &mdash; the boxes of old linen,<lb>
and such matters, being kept there. As she stood looking<lb>
down on the thirty pale sleepers, she remembered<lb>
that she had not played a hymn on the little organ for<lb>
Murry, as she had promised that day. Stealing softly to<lb>
the front, she peeped over the gallery, to see if he was<lb>
asleep; if not, she would keep her word, for he was her<lb>
favorite.</p>
<p>A screen had been drawn before the recess where the<lb>
two beds stood, shutting their occupants from the sight<lb>
of the other men. Murry lay sleeping, but Clay was<lb>
<pb n="306">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-325">

<figdesc>Page 306.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
awake, and a quick thrill tingled along the young<lb>
woman's nerves as she saw his face. Leaning on one<lb>
arm, he peered about the place with an eager, watchful<lb>
air, and glanced up at the dark gallery, but did not see<lb>
the startled face behind the central pillar. Pausing an<lb>
instant, he shook his one clenched hand at the unconscious<lb>
sleeper, and then threw out the locket cautiously.<lb>
Two white mugs, just alike, stood on the little table<lb>
between the beds, water in each. With another furtive<lb>
glance about him, Clay suddenly stretched out his long<lb>
arm, and dropped something from the locket into Murry's<lb>
cup. An instant he remained motionless, with a sinister<lb>
smile on his face; then, as Jim's step sounded beyond<lb>
the screen, he threw his arm over his face, and lay,<lb>
breathing heavily, as if asleep.</p>
<p>Mercy's first impulse was to cry out; her next, to fly<lb>
down and seize the cup. No time was to be lost, for<lb>
Murry might wake and drink at any moment. What<lb>
was in the cup? Poison, doubtless; that was the charm<lb>
Clay carried to free himself from &ldquo;pain, captivity and<lb>
shame,&rdquo; when all other hopes of escape vanished. This<lb>
hidden helper he gave up to destroy his enemy, who was<lb>
to outlive his shot, it seemed. Like a shadow, Mercy<lb>
glided down, forming her plan as she went. A dozen<lb>
mugs stood about the room, all alike in size and color;<lb>
catching up one, she partly filled it, and, concealing it<lb>
under the clean sheet hanging on her arm, went toward<lb>
the recess, saying audibly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want some fresh water, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus warned of her approach, Clay lay with carefullyaverted<lb>
face as she came in, and never stirred as she<lb>
bent over him, while she dexterously changed Murry's<lb>
<pb n="307">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-326">

<figdesc>Page 307.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
mug for the one she carried. Hiding the poisoned cup,<lb>
she went away, saying aloud, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the water, now, Jim. Murry is asleep,<lb>
and so is Clay; they'll not need it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight to Dr. Fitz Hugh's room she went, and gave<lb>
the cup into his keeping, with the story of what she had<lb>
seen. A man was dying, and there was no time to test<lb>
the water then; but putting it carefully away, he promised<lb>
to set her fears at rest in the morning. To quiet<lb>
her impatience, Mercy went back to watch over Murry<lb>
till day dawned. As she sat down, she caught the glimmer<lb>
of a satisfied smile on Clay's lips, and looking into<lb>
the cup she had left, she saw that it was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is satisfied, for he thinks his horrible revenge is<lb>
secure. Sleep in peace, my poor boy! you are safe<lb>
while I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she thought this, she put her hand on the broad,<lb>
pale forehead of the sleeper with a motherly caress, but<lb>
started to feel how damp and cold it was. Looking<lb>
nearer, she saw that a change had passed over Murry,<lb>
for dark shadows showed about his sunken eyes, his once<lb>
quiet breath was faint and fitful now, his hand deathly<lb>
cold, and a chilly dampness had gathered on his face.<lb>
She looked at her watch; it was past twelve, and her<lb>
heart sunk within her, for she had so often seen that<lb>
solemn change come over men's faces then, that the hour<lb>
was doubly weird and woful to her. Sending a message<lb>
to Dr. Fitz Hugh, she waited anxiously, trying to believe<lb>
that she deceived herself.</p>
<p>The doctor came at once, and a single look convinced<lb>
him that he had left one death-bed for another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I feared,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that sudden rally was but<lb>
<pb n="308">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-327">

<figdesc>Page 308.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
a last effort of nature. There was just one chance for<lb>
him, and he has missed it. Poor lad! I can do nothing;<lb>
he'll sink rapidly, and go without pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can <hi rend="italics">I</hi> do nothing?&rdquo; asked Mercy, with dim eyes,<lb>
as she held the cold hand close in both her own with<lb>
tender pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him stimulants as long as he can swallow, and,<lb>
if he's conscious, take any messages he may have. Poor<lb>
Hall is dying hard, and I can help him; I'll come again<lb>
in an hour, and say good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kind doctor choked, touched the pale sleeper with<lb>
a gentle caress, and went away to help Hall die.</p>
<p>Murry slept on for an hour, then woke, and knew<lb>
without words that his brief hope was gone. He looked<lb>
up wistfully, and whispered, as Mercy tried to smile with<lb>
trembling lips that refused to tell the heavy truth, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know &mdash; I feel it; don't grieve yourself by trying to<lb>
tell me, dear friend. It's best so; I can bear it, &mdash; but I<lb>
did want to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any word for Mary, dear?&rdquo; asked Mercy,<lb>
for he seemed but a boy to her since she had nursed<lb>
him.</p>
<p>One look of sharp anguish and dark despair passed<lb>
over his face, as he wrung his thin hands and shut his<lb>
eyes, finding death terrible. It passed in a moment, and<lb>
his pallid countenance grew beautiful with the pathetic<lb>
patience of one who submits without complaint to the<lb>
inevitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her I was ready, and the only bitterness was<lb>
leaving her. I shall remember, and wait until she<lb>
comes. My little Mary! O, be kind to her, for my<lb>
sake, when you tell her this.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="309">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-328">

<figdesc>Page 309.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Murry, as God hears me. I will be a sister<lb>
to her while I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mercy spoke, with fervent voice, he laid the hand<lb>
that had ministered to him so faithfully against his cheek,<lb>
and lay silent, as if content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else? let me do something more. Is there no<lb>
other friend to be comforted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she is all I have in the world. I hoped to<lb>
make her so happy, to be so much to her, for she's a<lb>
lonely little thing; but God says `No,' and I submit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long pause, as he lay breathing heavily, with eyes<lb>
that were dimming fast fixed on the gentle face beside<lb>
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Jim my clothes, send Mary a bit of my hair,<lb>
and &mdash; may I give you this? it's a poor thing, but all I<lb>
have to leave you, best and kindest of women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to draw off a slender ring, but the strength<lb>
had gone out of his wasted fingers, and she helped him,<lb>
thanking him with the first tears he had seen her shed.<lb>
He seemed satisfied, but suddenly turned his eyes on<lb>
Clay, who lay as if asleep. A sigh broke from Murry,<lb>
and Mercy caught the words, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he do it, and I so helpless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; she whispered, eagerly, as she<lb>
remembered Clay's own words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he was the man who shot me, when he came.<lb>
I forgive him; but I wish he had spared me, for Mary's<lb>
sake,&rdquo; he answered sorrowfully, not angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really pardon him?&rdquo; cried Mercy, wondering,<lb>
yet touched by the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. He will be sorry one day, perhaps; at any<lb>
rate, he did what he thought his duty; and war makes<lb>
<pb n="310">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-329">

<figdesc>Page 310.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
brutes of us all sometimes, I fear. I'd like to say goodby;<lb>
but he's asleep after a weary day, so don't wake<lb>
him. Tell him I'm glad <hi rend="italics">he</hi> is to live, and that I forgive<lb>
him heartily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although uttered between long pauses, these words<lb>
seemed to have exhausted Murry, and he spoke no more<lb>
till Dr. Fitz Hugh came. To him he feebly returned<lb>
thanks, and whispered his farewell, then sank into a stupor,<lb>
during which life ebbed fast. Both nurse and doctor<lb>
forgot Clay as they hung over Murry, and neither saw<lb>
the strange intentness of his face, the half awe-struck,<lb>
half remorseful look he bent upon the dying man.</p>
<p>As the sun rose, sending its ruddy beams across the<lb>
silent ward, Murry looked up and smiled, for the bright<lb>
ray fell athwart the two coats hanging on the wall beside<lb>
him. Some passer-by had brushed one sleeve of the blue<lb>
coat across the gray, as if the inanimate things were<lb>
shaking hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be so &mdash; love our enemies; we should be<lb>
brothers,&rdquo; he murmured faintly; and, with the last impulse<lb>
of a noble nature, stretched his hand toward the<lb>
man who had murdered him.</p>
<p>But Clay shrunk back, and covered his face without a<lb>
word. When he ventured to look up, Murry was no<lb>
longer there. A pale, peaceful figure lay on the narrow<lb>
bed, and Mercy was smoothing the brown locks as she<lb>
cut a curl for Mary and herself. Clay could not take his<lb>
eyes away; as if fascinated by its serenity, he watched<lb>
the dead face with gloomy eyes, till Mercy, having done<lb>
her part, stooped and kissed the cold lips tenderly as she<lb>
left him to his sleep. Then, as if afraid to be alone with<lb>
the dead, he bid Jim put the screen between the beds,<lb>
<pb n="311">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-330">

<figdesc>Page 311.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and bring him a book. His order was obeyed; but he<lb>
never turned his pages, and lay, with muffled head, trying<lb>
to shut out little Watts' sobs, as the wounded drummer<lb>
boy mourned for Murry.</p>
<p>Death in an hospital makes no stir, and in an hour no<lb>
trace of the departed remained but the coat upon the<lb>
wall, for Jim would not take it down, though it was his<lb>
now. The empty bed stood freshly made, the clean cup<lb>
and worn Bible lay ready for other hands, and the card<lb>
at the bed's head hung blank for a new-comer's name.<lb>
In the hurry of this event, Clay's attempted crime was<lb>
forgotten for a time. But that evening Dr. Fitz Hugh<lb>
told Mercy that her suspicions were correct, for the water<lb>
<hi rend="italics">was</hi> poisoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How horrible! what shall we do?&rdquo; she cried, with<lb>
a gesture full of energetic indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to remorse!&rdquo; replied the doctor, sternly.<lb>
&ldquo;I've thought over the matter, and believe this to be the<lb>
only thing we can do. I fancy the man won't live a<lb>
week; his leg is in a bad way, and he is such a fiery<lb>
devil he gives himself no chance. Let him believe he<lb>
killed poor Murry, at least for a few days. He thinks<lb>
so now, and tries to rejoice; but if he has a human heart<lb>
he will repent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he may not. Should we not tell of this? Can<lb>
he not be punished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law won't hang a dying man, and I'll not denounce<lb>
him. Let remorse punish him while he lives, and God<lb>
judge him when he dies. Murry pardoned him, &mdash; can<lb>
we do less?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mercy's indignant face softened at the name, and for<lb>
Murry's sake she yielded. Neither spoke of what they<lb>
<pb n="312">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-331">

<figdesc>Page 312.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
tried to think the act of a half-delirious man; and soon<lb>
they could not refuse to pity him, for the doctor's prophecy<lb>
proved true.</p>
<p>Clay was a haunted man, and remorse gnawed like a<lb>
worm at his heart. Day and night he saw that tranquil<lb>
face on the pillow opposite; day and night he saw the<lb>
pale hand outstretched to him; day and night he heard<lb>
the faint voice murmuring kindly, regretfully, &ldquo;I forgive<lb>
him; but I wish he had spared me, for Mary's sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the days passed, and his strength visibly declined,<lb>
he began to suspect that he must soon follow Murry.<lb>
No one told him; for, though both doctor and nurse did<lb>
their duty faithfully, neither lingered long at his bedside,<lb>
and not one of the men showed any interest in him. No<lb>
new patient occupied the other bed, and he lay alone in<lb>
the recess with his own gloomy thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all up with me in a few days, won't it?&rdquo;<lb>
he asked, abruptly, as Jim made his toilet one morning<lb>
with unusual care, and such visible pity in his rough face<lb>
that Clay could not but observe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the doctor say you wouldn't suffer much<lb>
more. Is there any one you'd like to see, or leave a<lb>
message for?&rdquo; answered Jim, smoothing the long locks<lb>
as gently as a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn't a soul in the world that cares whether I<lb>
live or die, except the man who wants my money,&rdquo; said<lb>
Clay, bitterly, as his dark face grew a shade paler at this<lb>
confirmation of his fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't you head him off some way, and leave your<lb>
money to some one that's been kind to you? Here's the<lb>
doctor &mdash; or, better still, Miss Carrol. Neither on 'em<lb>
is rich, and both on 'em has been good friends to you, or<lb>
<pb n="313">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-332">

<figdesc>Page 313.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
you'd 'a' fared a deal wus than you have,&rdquo; said Jim, not<lb>
without the hope that, in saying a good word for them,<lb>
he might say one for himself also.</p>
<p>Clay lay thinking for a moment as his face clouded<lb>
over, and then brightened again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Mercy wouldn't take it, nor the doctor either;<lb>
but I know who will &mdash; and, by G&mdash;d, I'll do it!&rdquo; he<lb>
exclaimed, with sudden energy.</p>
<p>His eye happened to rest on Jim as he spoke, and<lb>
feeling sure that he was to be the heir, Jim retired to<lb>
send Miss Mercy, that the matter might be settled before<lb>
Clay's mood changed. Miss Carrol came, and began to<lb>
cut the buttons off Murry's coat while she waited for<lb>
Clay to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that for?&rdquo; he asked, restlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men want them, and Jim is willing, for the coat<lb>
is very old and ragged, you see. Murry gave his good<lb>
one away to a sicker comrade, and took this instead. It<lb>
was like him, &mdash; my poor boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd like to speak to you, if you have a minute to<lb>
spare,&rdquo; began Clay, after a pause, during which he<lb>
watched her with a wistful, almost tender expression,<lb>
unseen by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have time; what can I do for you?&rdquo; Very gentle<lb>
was Mercy's voice, very pitiful her glance, as she sat<lb>
down by him, for the change in his manner, and the<lb>
thought of his approaching death, touched her heart.</p>
<p>Trying to resume his former gruffness, and cold expression,<lb>
Clay said, as he picked nervously at the blanket, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've a little property that I put into the care of a<lb>
friend going North. He's kept it safe; and now, as I'll<lb>
never want it myself, I'd like to leave it to&mdash;&rdquo;. He<lb>
<pb n="314">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-333">

<figdesc>Page 314.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
paused an instant, glanced quickly at Mercy's face, and<lb>
seeing only womanly compassion there, added, with an<lb>
irrepressible tremble in his voice, &mdash; &ldquo;To little Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had expected any reward for the act, any comfort<lb>
for his lonely death-bed, he received both in fullest measure<lb>
when he saw Mercy's beautiful face flush with surprise<lb>
and pleasure, her eyes fill with sudden tears, and<lb>
heard her cordial voice, as she pressed his hand warmly<lb>
in her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could tell you how glad I am for this! I<lb>
thought you were better than you seemed; I was sure<lb>
you had both heart and conscience, and that you would<lb>
repent before you died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repent of what?&rdquo; he asked, with a startled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need I tell you?&rdquo; and her eye went from the empty<lb>
bed to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that shot? But it was only fair, after<lb>
all; we killed each other, and war is nothing but wholesale<lb>
murder, any way.&rdquo; He spoke easily, but his eyes<lb>
were full of trouble, and other words seemed to tremble<lb>
on his lips.</p>
<p>Leaning nearer, Mercy whispered in his ear, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the other murder, which you would have<lb>
committed when you poisoned the cup of water he offered<lb>
you, his enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every vestige of color faded out of Clay's thin face,<lb>
and his haggard eyes seemed fascinated by some spectre<lb>
opposite, as he muttered slowly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you;&rdquo; and she told him all the truth.</p>
<p>A look of intense relief passed over Clay's<lb>
<pb n="315">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-334">

<figdesc>Page 315.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
countenance, and the remorseful shadow lifted as he murmured,<lb>
brokenly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God I didn't kill him! Now, dying isn't so<lb>
hard; now I can have a little peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither spoke for several minutes; Mercy had no<lb>
words for such a time, and Clay forgot her presence as<lb>
the tears dropped from between the wasted fingers spread<lb>
before his face.</p>
<p>Presently he looked up, saying eagerly, as if his fluttering<lb>
breath and rapidly failing strength warned him of<lb>
approaching death, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you write down a few words for me, so Mary<lb>
can have the money? She needn't know anything about<lb>
me, only that I was one to whom Murry was kind, and<lb>
so I gave her all I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll get my pen and paper; rest, now, my poor fellow,&rdquo;<lb>
said Mercy, wiping the unheeded tears away for<lb>
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good it seems to hear you speak so to <hi rend="italics">me!</hi> How<lb>
can you do it?&rdquo; he whispered, with such grateful wonder<lb>
in his dim eyes that Mercy's heart smote her for the<lb>
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do it for Murry's sake, and because I sincerely<lb>
pity you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timidly turning his lips to that kind hand, he kissed<lb>
it, and then hid his face in his pillow. When Mercy<lb>
returned, she observed that there were but seven tarnished<lb>
buttons where she had left eight. She guessed who had<lb>
taken it, but said nothing, and endeavored to render poor<lb>
Clay's last hours as happy as sympathy and care could<lb>
make them. The letter and will were prepared as well<lb>
as they could be, and none too soon; for, as if that<lb>
<pb n="316">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-335">

<figdesc>Page 316.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
secret was the burden that bound Clay's spirit to the<lb>
shattered body, no sooner was it lifted off than the<lb>
diviner part seemed ready to be gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll stay with me; you'll help me die; and &mdash; oh,<lb>
if I dared to ask it, I'd beg you to kiss me once when I<lb>
and dead, as you did Murry. I think I could rest then,<lb>
and be fitter to meet him, if the Lord lets me,&rdquo; he cried<lb>
imploringly, as the last night gathered around him, and<lb>
the coming change seemed awful to a soul that possessed<lb>
no inward peace, and no firm hope to lean on through the<lb>
valley of the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will &mdash; I will! Hold fast to me, and believe in<lb>
the eternal mercy of God,&rdquo; whispered Miss Carrol, with<lb>
her firm hand in his, her tender face bending over him<lb>
as the long struggle began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy,&rdquo; he murmured, catching that word, and smiling<lb>
feebly as he repeated it lingeringly. &ldquo;Mercy! yes,<lb>
I believe in her; she'll save me, if any one can. Lord,<lb>
bless and keep her forever and forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no morning sunshine to gladden his dim<lb>
eyes as they looked their last, but the pale glimmer of<lb>
the lamp shone full on the blue and the gray coats hanging<lb>
side by side. As if the sight recalled that other<lb>
death-bed, that last act of brotherly love and pardon,<lb>
Clay rose up in his bed, and while one hand clutched the<lb>
button hidden in his breast, the other was outstretched<lb>
toward the empty bed, as his last breath parted in a cry<lb>
of remorseful longing, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will! I will! Forgive me, Murry, and let me say<lb>
good-by!&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>MERRY Christmas!&rdquo; &ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; &ldquo;Merry<lb>
Christmas, and lots of 'em, ma'am!&rdquo; echoed from<lb>
every side, as Miss Hale entered her ward in the gray<lb>
December dawn. No wonder the greetings were hearty,<lb>
that thin faces brightened, and eyes watched for the coming<lb>
of this small luminary more eagerly than for the<lb>
rising of the sun; for when they woke that morning,<lb>
each man found that in the silence of the night some<lb>
friendly hand had laid a little gift beside his bed. Very<lb>
humble little gifts they were, but well chosen and thoughtfully<lb>
bestowed by one who made the blithe anniversary<lb>
pleasant even in a hospital, and sweetly taught the lesson<lb>
of the hour &mdash; Peace on earth, good-will to man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, ma'am, these are just splendid. I've dreamt<lb>
about such for a week, but I never thought I'd get 'em,&rdquo;<lb>
cried one poor fellow, surveying a fine bunch of grapes<lb>
with as much satisfaction as if he had found a fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly, Miss, for the paper and the fixings.<lb>
I hated to keep borrowing, but I hadn't any<lb>
money,&rdquo; said another, eying his gift with happy anticipations<lb>
of the home letters with which the generous pages<lb>
should be filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are dreadful soft and pretty, but I don't believe<lb>
I'll ever wear 'em out; my legs are so wimbly there's no<lb>
<pb n="318">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-337">

<figdesc>Page 318.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
go in 'em,&rdquo; whispered a fever patient, looking sorrowfully<lb>
at the swollen feet ornamented with a pair of carpet<lb>
slippers gay with roses, and evidently made for his<lb>
especial need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please hang my posy basket on the gas-burner in the<lb>
middle of the room, where all the boys can see it. It's<lb>
too pretty for one alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then you can't see it yourself, Joe, and you are<lb>
fonder of such things than the rest,&rdquo; said Miss Hale,<lb>
taking both the little basket and the hand of her pet<lb>
patient, a lad of twenty, dying of rapid consumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's the reason I can spare it for a while, for I<lb>
shall feel 'em in the room just the same, and they'll do<lb>
the boys good. You pick out the one you like best, for<lb>
me to keep, and hang up the rest till by-and-by, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a sprig of mignonette, and he smiled as<lb>
he took it, for it reminded him of her in her sad-colored<lb>
gown, as quiet and unobtrusive, but as grateful to the<lb>
hearts of those about her as was the fresh scent of the flower<lb>
to the lonely lad who never had known womanly tenderness<lb>
and care until he found them in a hospital. Joe's<lb>
prediction was verified; the flowers did do the boys good,<lb>
for all welcomed them with approving glances, and all<lb>
felt their refining influence more or less keenly, from<lb>
cheery Ben, who paused to fill the cup inside with fresher<lb>
water, to surly Sam, who stopped growling as his eye<lb>
rested on a geranium very like the one blooming in his<lb>
sweetheart's window when they parted a long year ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, as this is to be a merry day, let us begin to<lb>
enjoy it at once. Fling up the windows, Ben, and Barney,<lb>
go for breakfast while I finish washing faces and<lb>
settling bed-clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which directions the little woman fell to work<lb>
with such infectious energy that in fifteen minutes thirty<lb>
gentlemen with spandy clean faces and hands were partaking<lb>
of refreshment with as much appetite as their<lb>
various conditions would permit. Meantime the sun<lb>
came up, looking bigger, brighter, jollier than usual, as<lb>
he is apt to do on Christmas days. Not a snow-flake<lb>
chilled the air that blew in as blandly as if winter had<lb>
relented, and wished the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; the compliments of the<lb>
season in his mildest mood; while a festival smell pervaded<lb>
the whole house, and appetizing rumors of turkey,<lb>
mince-pie, and oysters for dinner, circulated through the<lb>
wards. When breakfast was done, the wounds dressed,<lb>
directions for the day delivered, and as many of the disagreeables<lb>
as possible well over, the fun began. In any<lb>
other place that would have been considered a very quiet<lb>
morning; but to the weary invalids prisoned in that<lb>
room, it was quite a whirl of excitement. None were<lb>
dangerously ill but Joe, and all were easily amused, for<lb>
weakness, homesickness and <hi rend="italics">ennui</hi> made every trifle a<lb>
joke or an event.</p>
<p>In came Ben, looking like a &ldquo;Jack in the Green,&rdquo; with<lb>
his load of hemlock and holly. Such of the men as<lb>
could get about and had a hand to lend, lent it, and soon,<lb>
under Miss Hale's direction, a green bough hung at the<lb>
head of each bed, depended from the gas-burners, and<lb>
nodded over the fireplace, while the finishing effect was<lb>
given by a cross and crown at the top and bottom of the<lb>
room. Great was the interest, many were the mishaps,<lb>
and frequent was the laughter which attended this performance;<lb>
for wounded men, when convalescent, are particularly<lb>
jovial. When &ldquo;Daddy Mills,&rdquo; as one venerable<lb>

</eaffig>
volunteer was irreverently christened, expatiated learnedly<lb>
upon the difference between &ldquo;sprewce, hemlock and<lb>
pine,&rdquo; how they all listened, each thinking of some<lb>
familiar wood still pleasantly haunted by boyish recollections<lb>
of stolen gunnings, gum-pickings, and bird-nestings.<lb>
When quiet Hayward amazed the company by<lb>
coming out strong in a most unexpected direction, and<lb>
telling with much effect the story of a certain &ldquo;fine old<lb>
gentleman&rdquo; who supped on hemlock tea and died like a<lb>
hero, what commendations were bestowed upon the immortal<lb>
heathen in language more hearty than classical,<lb>
as a twig of the historical tree was passed round like a<lb>
new style of refreshment, that inquiring parties might<lb>
satisfy themselves regarding the flavor of the Socratic<lb>
draught. When Barney, the colored incapable, essayed<lb>
a grand ornament above the door, and relying upon one<lb>
insufficient nail, descended to survey his success with the<lb>
proud exclamation, &ldquo;Look at de neatness of dat job,<lb>
gen'l'men,&rdquo; &mdash; at which point the whole thing tumbled<lb>
down about his ears, &mdash; how they all shouted but Pneumonia<lb>
Ned, who, having lost his voice, could only make<lb>
ecstatic demonstrations with his legs. When Barney cast<lb>
himself and his hammer despairingly upon the floor, and<lb>
Miss Hale, stepping into a chair, pounded stoutly at the<lb>
traitorous nail and performed some miracle with a bit<lb>
of string which made all fast, what a burst of applause<lb>
arose from the beds. When gruff Dr. Bangs came in to<lb>
see what all the noise was about, and the same intrepid<lb>
lady not only boldly explained, but stuck a bit of holly in<lb>
his button-hole, and wished him a merry Christmas with<lb>
such a face full of smiles that the crabbed old doctor felt<lb>
himself giving in very fast, and bolted out again, calling<lb>

Christmas a humbug, and exulting over the thirty emetics<lb>
he would have to prescribe on the morrow, what indignant<lb>
denials followed him. And when all was done,<lb>
how everybody agreed with Joe when he said, &ldquo;I think<lb>
we are coming Christmas in great style; things look so<lb>
green and pretty, I feel as I was settin' in a bower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing to survey her work, Miss Hale saw Sam looking<lb>
as black as any thunder-cloud. He bounced over on<lb>
his bed the moment he caught her eye, but she followed<lb>
him up, and gently covering the cold shoulder he evidently<lb>
meant to show her, peeped over it, asking, with<lb>
unabated gentleness, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, Sam? I want to have all<lb>
the faces in my ward bright ones to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My box ain't come; they said I should have it two,<lb>
three days ago; why don't they do it, then?&rdquo; growled<lb>
Ursur Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a busy time, you know, but it will come if they<lb>
promised, and patience won't delay it, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My patience is used up, and they are a mean set of<lb>
slow coaches. I'd get it fast enough if I wore shoulder<lb>
straps; as I don't, I'll bet I sha'n't see it till the things<lb>
ain't fit to eat; the news is old, and I don't care a hang<lb>
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll see what I can do; perhaps before the hurry of<lb>
dinner begins some one will have time to go for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody ever does have time here but folks who<lb>
would give all they are worth to be stirring round. You<lb>
can't get it, I know; it's my luck, so don't you worry,<lb>
ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Hale did not &ldquo;worry,&rdquo; but worked, and in time<lb>
a messenger was found, provided with the necessary<lb>
<pb n="322">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-341">

<figdesc>Page 322.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
money, pass and directions, and despatched to hunt up<lb>
the missing Christmas-box. Then she paused to see<lb>
what came next, not that it was necessary to look for a<lb>
task, but to decide which, out of many, was most important<lb>
to do first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Turner, crying again so soon? What is it<lb>
now? the light head or the heavy feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's my bones, ma'am. They ache so I can't lay<lb>
easy any way, and I'm so tired I just wish I could die<lb>
and be out of this misery,&rdquo; sobbed the poor ghost of a<lb>
once strong and cheery fellow, as the kind hand wiped<lb>
his tears away, and gently rubbed the weary shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't wish that Turner, for the worst is over now,<lb>
and all you need is to get your strength again. Make<lb>
an effort to sit up a little; it is quite time you tried; a<lb>
change of posture will help the ache wonderfully, and<lb>
make this `dreadful bed,' as you call it, seem very comfortable<lb>
when you come back to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't, ma'am, my legs ain't a bit of use, and I<lb>
ain't strong enough even to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never will be if you don't try. Never mind<lb>
the poor legs, Ben will carry you. I've got the matron's<lb>
easy-chair all ready, and can make you very cosy by the<lb>
fire. It's Christmas-day, you know; why not celebrate it<lb>
by overcoming the despondency which retards your recovery,<lb>
and prove that illness has not taken all the manhood<lb>
out of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has, though, I'll never be the man I was, and may<lb>
as well lay here till spring, for I shall be no use if I do<lb>
get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Sam was a growler this man was a whiner, and<lb>
few hospital wards are without both. But knowing that<lb>

<figdesc>Page 323.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
much suffering had soured the former and pitifully weakened<lb>
the latter, their nurse had patience with them, and<lb>
still hoped to bring them round again. As Turner whimpered<lb>
out his last dismal speech she bethought herself of<lb>
something which, in the hurry of the morning, had<lb>
slipped her mind till now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I've got another present for you. The<lb>
doctor thought I'd better not give it yet, lest it should<lb>
excite you too much; but I think you need excitement to<lb>
make you forget yourself, and that when you find how<lb>
many blessings you have to be grateful for, you will<lb>
make an effort to enjoy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessings, ma'am? I don't see 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't you see one now?&rdquo; and drawing a letter from<lb>
her pocket she held it before his eyes. His listless face<lb>
brightened a little as he took it, but gloomed over again<lb>
as he said fretfully, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's from wife, I guess. I like to get her letters, but<lb>
they are always full of grievings and groanings over me,<lb>
so they don't do me much good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not grieve and groan in this one. She is too<lb>
happy to do that, and so will you be when you read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't see why, &mdash; hey? &mdash; why you don't mean &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I do!&rdquo; cried the little woman, clapping her<lb>
hands, and laughing so delightedly that the Knight of the<lb>
Rueful Countenance was betrayed into a broad smile for<lb>
the first time in many weeks. &ldquo;Is not a splendid little<lb>
daughter a present to rejoice over and be grateful for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray! hold on a bit, &mdash; it's all right, &mdash; I'll be out<lb>
again in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After which remarkably spirited burst, Turner vanished<lb>
under the bed-clothes, letter and all. Whether he read,<lb>
<pb n="324">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-343">

<figdesc>Page 324.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
laughed or cried, in the seclusion of that cotton grotto,<lb>
was unknown; but his nurse suspected that he did all<lb>
three, for when he reappeared he looked as if during<lb>
that pause he had dived into his &ldquo;sea of troubles,&rdquo; and<lb>
fished up his old self again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <hi rend="italics">will</hi> I name her?&rdquo; was his first remark, delivered<lb>
with such vivacity that his neighbors began to think<lb>
he was getting delirious again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your wife's name?&rdquo; asked Miss Hale, gladly<lb>
entering into the domesticities which were producing<lb>
such a salutary effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name's Ann, but neither of us like it. I'd fixed<lb>
on George, for I wanted my boy called after me; and<lb>
now you see I ain't a bit prepared for this young woman.&rdquo;<lb>
Very proud of the young woman he seemed, nevertheless,<lb>
and perfectly resigned to the loss of the expected<lb>
son and heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not call her Georgiana then? That combines<lb>
both her parents' names, and is not a bad one in itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that's just the brightest thing I ever heard in<lb>
my life!&rdquo; cried Turner, sitting bolt upright in his excitement,<lb>
though half an hour before he would have considered<lb>
it an utterly impossible feat. &ldquo;Georgiana Butterfield<lb>
Turner, &mdash; it's a tip-top name, ma'am, and we can<lb>
call her Georgie just the same. Ann will like that, it's<lb>
so genteel. Bless 'em both! don't I wish I was at<lb>
home.&rdquo; And down he lay again, despairing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be before long, if you choose. Get your<lb>
strength up, and off you go. Come, begin at once, &mdash;<lb>
drink your beef-tea, and sit up for a few minutes, just in<lb>
honor of the good news, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, by George! &mdash; no, by Georgiana! That's a<lb>
<pb n="325">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-344">

<figdesc>Page 325.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
good one, ain't it?&rdquo; and the whole ward was electrified<lb>
by hearing a genuine giggle from the &ldquo;Blueing-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down went the detested beef-tea, and up scrambled<lb>
the determined drinker with many groans, and a curious<lb>
jumble of chuckles, staggers, and fragmentary repetitions<lb>
of his first, last, and only joke. But when fairly settled<lb>
in the great rocking-chair, with the gray flannel gown<lb>
comfortably on, and the new slippers getting their inaugural<lb>
scorch, Turner forgot his bones, and swung to and<lb>
fro before the fire, feeling amazingly well, and looking<lb>
very like a trussed fowl being roasted in the primitive<lb>
fashion. The languid importance of the man, and the<lb>
irrepressible satisfaction of the parent, were both laughable<lb>
and touching things to see, for the happy soul could<lb>
not keep the glad tidings to himself. A hospital ward is<lb>
often a small republic, beautifully governed by pity,<lb>
patience, and the mutual sympathy which lessens mutual<lb>
suffering. Turner was no favorite; but more than one<lb>
honest fellow felt his heart warm towards him as they<lb>
saw his dismal face kindle with fatherly pride, and heard<lb>
the querulous quaver of his voice soften with fatherly<lb>
affection, as he said, &ldquo;My little Georgie, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He'll do now, ma'am; this has given him the boost<lb>
he needed, and in a week or two he'll be off our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Ben made the remark with a beaming countenance,<lb>
and Big Ben deserves a word of praise, because he never<lb>
said one for himself. An ex-patient, promoted to an<lb>
attendant's place, which he filled so well that he was<lb>
regarded as a model for all the rest to copy. Patient,<lb>
strong, and tender, he seemed to combine many of the<lb>
best traits of both man and woman; for he appeared to<lb>
know by instinct where the soft spot was to be found<lb>
<pb n="326">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-345">

<figdesc>Page 326.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
in every heart, and how best to help sick body or sad<lb>
soul. No one would have guessed this to have seen him<lb>
lounging in the hall during one of the short rests he<lb>
allowed himself. A brawny, six-foot fellow, in red shirt,<lb>
blue trousers tucked into his boots, an old cap, visor<lb>
always up, and under it a roughly-bearded, coarselyfeatured<lb>
face, whose prevailing expression was one of<lb>
great gravity and kindliness, though a humorous twinkle<lb>
of the eye at times betrayed the man, whose droll sayings<lb>
often set the boys in a roar. &ldquo;A good-natured, clumsy<lb>
body&rdquo; would have been the verdict passed upon him by<lb>
a casual observer; but watch him in his ward, and see<lb>
how great a wrong that hasty judgment would have<lb>
done him.</p>
<p>Unlike his predecessor, who helped himself generously<lb>
when the meals came up, and carelessly served out<lb>
rations for the rest, leaving even the most helpless to<lb>
bungle for themselves or wait till he was done, shut himself<lb>
into his pantry, and there, &mdash; to borrow a hospital<lb>
phrase, &mdash; gormed, Ben often left nothing for himself, or<lb>
took cheerfully such cold bits as remained when all the<lb>
rest were served; so patiently feeding the weak, being<lb>
hands and feet to the maimed, and a pleasant provider<lb>
for all that, as one of the boys said, &mdash; &ldquo;It gives a relish<lb>
to the vittles to have Ben fetch 'em.&rdquo; If one were restless,<lb>
Ben carried him in his strong arms; if one were<lb>
undergoing the sharp torture of the surgeon's knife, Ben<lb>
held him with a touch as firm as kind; if one were homesick,<lb>
Ben wrote letters for him with great hearty blots<lb>
and dashes under all the affectionate or important words.<lb>
More than one poor fellow read his fate in Ben's pitiful<lb>
eyes, and breathed his last breath away on Ben's broad<lb>
<pb n="327">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-346">

<figdesc>Page 327.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
breast, &mdash; always a quiet pillow till its work was done,<lb>
then it would heave with genuine grief, as his big hand<lb>
softly closed the tired eyes, and made another comrade<lb>
ready for the last review. The war shows us many Bens,&mdash;<lb>
for the same power of human pity which makes<lb>
women brave also makes men tender; and each is the<lb>
womanlier, the manlier, for these revelations of unsuspected<lb>
strength and sympathies.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock dinner was the prevailing idea in<lb>
ward No. 3, and when the door opened every man sniffed,<lb>
for savory odors broke loose from the kitchens and went<lb>
roaming about the house. Now this Christmas dinner<lb>
had been much talked of; for certain charitable and<lb>
patriotic persons had endeavored to provide every hospital<lb>
in Washington with materials for this time-honored<lb>
feast. Some mistake in the list sent to head-quarters,<lb>
some unpardonable neglect of orders, or some premeditated<lb>
robbery, caused the long-expected dinner in the &mdash;<lb>
Hospital to prove a dead failure; but to which of these<lb>
causes it was attributable was never known, for the deepest<lb>
mystery enveloped that sad transaction. The full<lb>
weight of the dire disappointment was mercifully lightened<lb>
by premonitions of the impending blow. Barney<lb>
was often missing; for the attendants were to dine <foreign lang="fr" rend="italics">en<lb>
masse</foreign> after the patients were done, therefore a speedy<lb>
banquet for the latter parties was ardently desired, and<lb>
he probably devoted his energies to goading on the cooks.<lb>
From time to time he appeared in the doorway, flushed<lb>
and breathless, made some thrilling announcement, and<lb>
vanished, leaving ever-increasing appetite, impatience<lb>
and expectation, behind him.</p>
<p>Dinner was to be served at one; at half-past twelve<lb>
<pb n="328">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-347">

<figdesc>Page 328.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Barney proclaimed, &ldquo;Dere ain't no vegetables but squash<lb>
and pitaters.&rdquo; A universal groan arose; and several<lb>
indignant parties on a short allowance of meat consigned<lb>
the defaulting cook to a warmer climate than the tropical<lb>
one he was then enjoying. At twenty minutes to one,<lb>
Barney increased the excitement by whispering, ominously,<lb>
&ldquo;I say, de puddins isn't plummy ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fling a piller at him and shut the door, Ben,&rdquo; roared<lb>
one irascible being, while several others <hi rend="italics">not</hi> fond of puddings<lb>
received the fact with equanimity. At quarter to<lb>
one Barney piled up the agony by adding the bitter<lb>
information, &ldquo;Dere isn't but two turkeys for dis ward,<lb>
and dey's little fellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiety instantly appeared in every countenance, and<lb>
intricate calculations were made as to how far the two<lb>
fowls would go when divided among thirty men; also<lb>
friendly warnings were administered to several of the<lb>
feebler gentlemen not to indulge too freely, if at all, for<lb>
fear of relapses. Once more did the bird of evil omen<lb>
return, for at ten minutes to one Barney croaked through<lb>
the key-hole, &ldquo;Only jes half ob de pies has come, gen'l'men.&rdquo;<lb>
That capped the climax, for the masculine palate<lb>
has a predilection for pastry, and mince-pie was the sheetanchor<lb>
to which all had clung when other hopes went<lb>
down. Even Ben looked dismayed; not that he expected<lb>
anything but the perfume and pickings for his share, but<lb>
he had set his heart on having the dinner an honor to the<lb>
institution and a memorable feast for the men, so far<lb>
away from home, and all that usually makes the day a<lb>
festival among the poorest. He looked pathetically grave<lb>
as Turner began to fret, Sam began to swear under his<lb>
breath, Hayward to sigh, Joe to wish it was all over, and<lb>
<pb n="329">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-348">

<figdesc>Page 329.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the rest began to vent their emotions with a freedom which<lb>
was anything but inspiring. At that moment Miss Hale<lb>
came in with a great basket of apples and oranges in one<lb>
hand, and several convivial-looking bottles in the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is our dessert, boys! A kind friend remembered<lb>
us, and we will drink her health in her own currant<lb>
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeble smile circulated round the room, and in some<lb>
sanguine bosoms hope revived again. Ben briskly emptied<lb>
the basket, while Miss Hale whispered to Joe, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you would be glad to get away from the<lb>
confusion of this next hour, to enjoy a breath of fresh<lb>
air, and dine quietly with Mrs. Burton round the corner,<lb>
wouldn't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma'am, so much! the noise, the smells, the fret<lb>
and flurry, make me sick just to think of! But how can<lb>
I go? that dreadful ambulance 'most killed me last time,<lb>
and I'm weaker now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, I have no thought of trying that again<lb>
till our ambulances are made fit for the use of weak and<lb>
wounded men. Mrs. Burton's carriage is at the door,<lb>
with her motherly self inside, and all you have got to do<lb>
is to let me bundle you up, and Ben carry you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a long sigh of relief Joe submited to both these<lb>
processes, and when his nurse watched his happy face as<lb>
the carriage slowly rolled away, she felt well repaid for<lb>
the little sacrifice of rest and pleasure so quietly made;<lb>
for Mrs. Burton came to carry her, not Joe, away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ben, help me to make this unfortunate dinner<lb>
go off as well as we can,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;On many<lb>
accounts it is a mercy that the men are spared the temptations<lb>
of a more generous meal; pray don't tell them<lb>
<pb n="330">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-349">

<figdesc>Page 330.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
so, but make the best of it, as you know very well how<lb>
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll try my best, Miss Hale, but I'm no less disappointed,<lb>
for some of 'em, being no better than children,<lb>
have been living on the thoughts of it for a week, and it<lb>
comes hard to give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Ben had been an old-time patriarch, and the thirty<lb>
boys his sons, he could not have spoken with a more<lb>
paternal regret, or gone to work with a better will. Putting<lb>
several small tables together in the middle of the<lb>
room, he left Miss Hale to make a judicious display of<lb>
plates, knives and forks, while he departed for the banquet.<lb>
Presently he returned, bearing the youthful turkeys<lb>
and the vegetables in his tray, followed by Barney,<lb>
looking unutterable things at a plum-pudding baked in a<lb>
milk-pan, and six very small pies. Miss Hale played a<lb>
lively tattoo as the procession approached, and, when the<lb>
viands were arranged, with the red and yellow fruit prettily<lb>
heaped up in the middle, it really did look like a<lb>
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's richness! here's the delicacies of the season<lb>
and the comforts of life!&rdquo; said Ben, falling back to survey<lb>
the table with as much apparent satisfaction as if it<lb>
had been a lord mayor's feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, hurry up, and give us our dinner, what there<lb>
is of it!&rdquo; grumbled Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; continued Ben, beginning to cut up the turkeys,<lb>
&ldquo;these noble birds have been sacrificed for the<lb>
defenders of their country; they will go as far as ever<lb>
they can, and, when they can't go any farther, we shall<lb>
endeavor to supply their deficiencies with soup or ham,<lb>
oysters having given out unexpectedly. Put it to vote;<lb>
<pb n="331">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-350">

<figdesc>Page 331.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
both have been provided on this joyful occasion, and a<lb>
word will fetch either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ham! ham!&rdquo; resounded from all sides. Soup was<lb>
an every-day affair, and therefore repudiated with scorn;<lb>
but ham, being a rarity, was accepted as a proper reward<lb>
of merit and a tacit acknowledgment of their wrongs.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;noble birds&rdquo; did go as far as possible, and were<lb>
handsomely assited by their fellow martyr. The pudding<lb>
was not as plummy as could have been desired, but a<lb>
slight exertion of fancy made the crusty knobs do duty<lb>
for raisins. The pies were small, yet a laugh added<lb>
flavor to the mouthful apiece, for, when Miss Hale asked<lb>
Ben to cut them up, that individual regarded her with an<lb>
inquiring aspect as he said, in his drollest tone, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't wish to appear stupid, ma'am, but, when<lb>
you mention `pies,' I presume you allude to these trifles.<lb>
`Tarts,' or `patties,' would meet my views better, in<lb>
speaking of the third course of this lavish dinner. As<lb>
such I will do my duty by 'em, hoping that the appetites<lb>
is to match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully dividing the six pies into twenty-nine diminutive<lb>
wedges, he placed each in the middle of a large<lb>
clean plate, and handed them about with the gravity of<lb>
an undertaker. Dinner had restored good humor to<lb>
many; this hit at the pies put the finishing touch to it,<lb>
and from that moment an atmosphere of jollity prevailed.<lb>
Healths were drunk in currant wine, apples and oranges<lb>
flew about as an impromptu game of ball was got up, Miss<lb>
Hale sang a Christmas carol, and Ben gambolled like a<lb>
sportive giant as he cleared away. Pausing in one of<lb>
his prances to and fro, he beckoned the nurse out, and,<lb>
when she followed, handed her a plate heaped up with<lb>
<pb n="332">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-351">

<figdesc>Page 332.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
good things from a better table than she ever sat at<lb>
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the matron, ma'am. Come right in here and<lb>
eat it while it's hot; they are most through in the dining-room,<lb>
and you'll get nothing half so nice,&rdquo; said Ben,<lb>
leading the way into his pantry and pointing to a sunny<lb>
window-seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure she meant it for me, and not for yourself,<lb>
Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she did! Why, what should I do with it,<lb>
when I've just been feastin' sumptuous in this very<lb>
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't exactly see what you have been feasting on,&rdquo;<lb>
said Miss Hale, glancing round the tidy pantry as she sat<lb>
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Havin' eat up the food and washed up the dishes, it<lb>
naturally follows that you don't see, ma'am. But if I go<lb>
off in a fit by-and-by you'll know what it's owin' to,&rdquo;<lb>
answered Ben, vainly endeavoring to look like a man<lb>
suffering from repletion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such kind fibs are not set down against one, Ben, so<lb>
I will eat your dinner, for if I don't I know you will<lb>
throw it out of the window to prove that you can't<lb>
eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee ma'am, I'm afraid I should; for, at the<lb>
rate he's going on, Barney wouldn't be equal to it,&rdquo; said<lb>
Ben, looking very much relieved, as he polished his last<lb>
pewter fork and hung his towels up to dry.</p>
<p>A pretty general siesta followed the excitement of dinner,<lb>
but by three o'clock the public mind was ready for<lb>
amusement, and the arrival of Sam's box provided it.<lb>
He was asleep when it was brought in and quietly<lb>
<pb n="333">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-352">

<figdesc>Page 333.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
deposited at his bed's foot, ready to surprise him on awaking.<lb>
The advent of a box was a great event, for the fortunate<lb>
receiver seldom failed to &ldquo;stand treat,&rdquo; and next best to<lb>
getting things from one's own home was the getting them<lb>
from some other boy's home. This was an unusually<lb>
large box, and all felt impatient to have it opened, though<lb>
Sam's exceeding crustiness prevented the indulgence of<lb>
great expectations. Presently he roused, and the first<lb>
thing his eye fell upon was the box, with his own name<lb>
sprawling over it in big black letters. As if it were<lb>
merely the continuance of his dream, he stared stupidly<lb>
at it for a moment, then rubbed his eyes and sat up, exclaiming, &mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! that's mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! who said it wouldn't come? who hadn't the<lb>
faith of a grasshopper? and who don't half deserve it for<lb>
being a Barker by nater as by name?&rdquo; cried Ben, emphasizing<lb>
each question with a bang on the box, as he<lb>
waited, hammer in hand, for the arrival of the ward-master,<lb>
whose duty it was to oversee the opening of such<lb>
matters, lest contraband articles should do mischief to<lb>
the owner or his neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain't it a jolly big one? Knock it open, and don't<lb>
wait for anybody or anything!&rdquo; cried Sam, tumbling off<lb>
his bed and beating impatiently on the lid with his one<lb>
hand.</p>
<p>In came the ward-master, off came the cover, and out<lb>
came a motley collection of apples, socks, dough-nuts,<lb>
paper, pickles, photographs, pocket-handkerchiefs, gingerbread,<lb>
letters, jelly, newspapers, tobacco, and cologne.<lb>
&ldquo;All right, glad it's come, &mdash; don't kill yourself,&rdquo; said the<lb>
ward-master, as he took a hasty survey and walked off<lb>
<pb n="334">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-353">

<figdesc>Page 334.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
again. Drawing the box nearer the bed, Ben delicately<lb>
followed, and Sam was left to brood over his treasures in<lb>
peace.</p>
<p>At first all the others, following Ben's example, made<lb>
elaborate pretences of going to sleep, being absorbed in<lb>
books, or utterly uninterested in the outer world. But<lb>
very soon curiosity got the better of politeness, and one<lb>
by one they all turned round and stared. They might<lb>
have done so from the first, for Sam was perfectly unconscious<lb>
of everything but his own affairs, and, having read<lb>
the letters, looked at the pictures, unfolded the bundles,<lb>
turned everything inside out and upside down, tasted all<lb>
the eatables and made a spectacle of himself with jelly,<lb>
he paused to get his breath and find his way out of the<lb>
confusion he had created. Presently he called out, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Hale, will you come and right up my duds for<lb>
me?&rdquo; adding, as her woman's hands began to bring<lb>
matters straight, &ldquo;I don't know what to do with 'em all,<lb>
for some won't keep long, and it will take pretty steady<lb>
eating to get through 'em in time, supposin' appetite<lb>
holds out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do the others manage with their things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know they give 'em away; but I'll be hanged<lb>
if I do, for they are always callin' names and pokin' fun<lb>
at me. Guess they won't get anything out of me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old morose look came back as he spoke, for it had<lb>
disappeared while reading the home letters, touching the<lb>
home gifts. Still busily folding and arranging, Miss<lb>
Hale asked, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the story of the Three Cakes; which are<lb>
you going to be &mdash; Harry, Peter, or Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam began to laugh at this sudden application of the<lb>
<pb n="335">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-354">

<figdesc>Page 335.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
nursery legend; and, seeing her advantage, Miss Hale<lb>
pursued it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all know how much you have suffered, and all<lb>
respect you for the courage with which you have borne<lb>
your long confinement and your loss; but don't you think<lb>
you have given the boys some cause for making fun of<lb>
you, as you say? You used to be a favorite, and can be<lb>
again, if you will only put off these crusty ways, which<lb>
will grow upon you faster than you think. Better lose<lb>
both arms than cheerfulness and self-control, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing to see how her little lecture was received, she<lb>
saw that Sam's better self was waking up, and added yet<lb>
another word, hoping to help a mental ailment as she<lb>
had done so many physical ones. Looking up at him<lb>
with her kind eyes, she said, in a lowered voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day, on which the most perfect life began, is a<lb>
good day for all of us to set about making ourselves<lb>
readier to follow that divine example. Troubles are<lb>
helpers if we take them kindly, and the bitterest may<lb>
sweeten us for all our lives. Believe and try this, Sam,<lb>
and when you go away from us let those who love you<lb>
find that two battles have been fought, two victories<lb>
won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam made no answer, but sat thoughtfully picking at<lb>
the half-eaten cookey in his hand. Presently he stole a<lb>
glance about the room, and, as if all helps were waiting<lb>
for him, his eye met Joe's. From his solitary corner by<lb>
the fire and the bed he would seldom leave again until he<lb>
went into his grave, the boy smiled back at him so<lb>
heartily, so happily, that something gushed warm across<lb>
Sam's heart as he looked down upon the faces of mother,<lb>
sister, sweetheart, scattered round him, and remembered<lb>
<pb n="336">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-355">

<figdesc>Page 336.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
how poor his comrade was in all such tender ties,<lb>
and yet how rich in that beautiful content, which, &ldquo;having<lb>
nothing, yet hath all.&rdquo; The man had no words in<lb>
which to express this feeling, but it came to him and did<lb>
him good, as he proved in his own way. &ldquo;Miss Hale,&rdquo;<lb>
he said, a little awkwardly, &ldquo;I wish you'd pick out what<lb>
you think each would like, and give 'em to the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got a smile in answer that drove him to his cookey<lb>
as a refuge, for his lips would tremble, and he felt half<lb>
proud, half ashamed to have earned such bright approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Ben help you, &mdash; he knows better than I. But<lb>
you must give them all yourself, it will so surprise and<lb>
please the boys; and then to-morrow we will write a<lb>
capital letter home, telling what a jubilee we made over<lb>
their fine box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this proposal Sam half repented; but, as Ben came<lb>
lumbering up at Miss Hale's summons, he laid hold of<lb>
his new resolution as if it was a sort of shower-bath and<lb>
he held the string, one pull of which would finish the<lb>
baptism. Dividing his most cherished possession, which<lb>
(alas for romance!) was the tobacco, he bundled the<lb>
larger half into a paper, whispering to Miss Hale, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben ain't exactly what you'd call a ministerin' angel<lb>
to look at, but he is amazin' near one in his ways, so I'm<lb>
goin' to begin with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up came the &ldquo;ministering angel,&rdquo; in red flannel and<lb>
cow-hide boots; and Sam tucked the little parcel into his<lb>
pocket, saying, as he began to rummage violently in<lb>
the box, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now jest hold your tongue, and lend a hand here<lb>
about these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben was so taken aback by this proceeding that he<lb>

<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-356">

<figdesc>Page 337.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="22">
stared blankly, till a look from Miss Hale enlightened<lb>
him; and, taking his cue, he played his part as well as<lb>
could be expected on so short a notice. Clapping Sam<lb>
on the shoulder, &mdash; not the bad one, Ben was always<lb>
thoughtful of those things, &mdash; he exclaimed heartily, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always said you'd come round when this poor arm<lb>
of yours got a good start, and here you are jollier'n ever.<lb>
Lend a hand! so I will, a pair of 'em. What's to do?<lb>
Pack these traps up again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I want you to tell what <hi rend="italics">you'd</hi> do with 'em if<lb>
they were yours. Free, you know, &mdash; as free as if they<lb>
really was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben held on to the box a minute as if this second surprise<lb>
rather took him off his legs; but another look from<lb>
the prime mover in this resolution steadied him, and he<lb>
fell to work as if Sam had been in the habit of being<lb>
&ldquo;free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let's see. I think I'd put the clothes and sich<lb>
into this smaller box that the bottles come in, and stan'<lb>
it under the table, handy. Here's newspapers &mdash; pictures<lb>
in 'em, too! I should make a circulatin' lib'ry of them;<lb>
they'll be a real treat. Pickles &mdash; well, I guess I should<lb>
keep them on the winder here as a kind of a relish dinnertimes,<lb>
or to pass along to them as longs for 'em. Cologne&mdash;<lb>
that's a dreadful handsome bottle, ain't it? That, now,<lb>
would be fust-rate to give away to somebody as was very<lb>
fond of it, &mdash; a kind of a delicate attention, you know, &mdash;<lb>
if you happen to meet such a person anywheres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben nodded towards Miss Hale, who was absorbed in<lb>
folding pocket-handkerchiefs. Sam winked expressively,<lb>
and patted the bottle as if congratulating himself that it<lb>
<hi rend="italics">was</hi> handsome, and that he <hi rend="italics">did</hi> know what to do with it.<lb>
<pb n="338">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-357">

<figdesc>Page 338.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
The pantomime was not elegant, but as much real affection<lb>
and respect went into it as if he had made a set<lb>
speech, and presented the gift upon his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letters and photographs I should probably keep<lb>
under my piller for a spell; the jelly I'd give to Miss<lb>
Hale, to use for the sick ones; the cake-stuff and that<lb>
pot of jam, that's gettin' ready to work, I'd stand treat<lb>
with for tea, as dinner wasn't all we could have wished.<lb>
The apples I'd keep to eat, and fling at Joe when he was<lb>
too bashful to ask for one, and the <hi rend="italics">tobaccer</hi> I would <hi rend="italics">not</hi> go<lb>
lavishin' on folks that have no business to be enjoyin'<lb>
luxuries when many a poor feller is dyin' of want down<lb>
to Charlestown. There, sir! that's what <hi rend="italics">I'd</hi> do if any<lb>
one was so clever as to send me a jolly box like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam was enjoying the full glow of his shower-bath by<lb>
this time. As Ben designated the various articles, he set<lb>
them apart; and when the inventory ended, he marched<lb>
away with the first instalment: two of the biggest, rosiest<lb>
apples for Joe, and all the pictorial papers. Pickles are<lb>
not usually regarded as tokens of regard, but as Sam<lb>
dealt them out one at a time, &mdash; for he would let nobody<lb>
help him, and his single hand being the left, was as<lb>
awkward as it was willing, &mdash; the boys' faces brightened;<lb>
for a friendly word accompanied each, which made the<lb>
sour gherkins as welcome as sweetmeats. With every<lb>
trip the donor's spirits rose; for Ben circulated freely<lb>
between whiles, and, thanks to him, not an allusion to<lb>
the past marred the satisfaction of the present. Jam,<lb>
soda-biscuits, and cake, were such welcome additions to<lb>
the usual bill of fare, that when supper was over a vote<lb>
of thanks was passed, and speeches were made; for,<lb>
being true Americans, the ruling passion found vent in<lb>
<pb n="339">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-358">

<figdesc>Page 339.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the usual &ldquo;Fellow-citizens!&rdquo; and allusions to the &ldquo;Starspangled<lb>
Banner.&rdquo; After which Sam subsided, feeling<lb>
himself a public benefactor, and a man of mark.</p>
<p>A perfectly easy, pleasant day throughout would be<lb>
almost an impossibility in any hospital, and this one was<lb>
no exception to the general rule; for, at the usual time,<lb>
Dr. Bangs went his rounds, leaving the customary amount<lb>
of discomfort, discontent and dismay behind him. A<lb>
skilful surgeon and an excellent man was Dr. Bangs, but<lb>
not a sanguine or conciliatory individual; many cares<lb>
and crosses caused him to regard the world as one large<lb>
hospital, and his fellow-beings all more or less dangerously<lb>
wounded patients in it. He saw life through the<lb>
bluest of blue spectacles, and seemed to think that the<lb>
sooner people quitted it the happier for them. He did<lb>
his duty by the men, but if they recovered he looked<lb>
half disappointed, and congratulated them with cheerful<lb>
prophecies that there would come a time when they<lb>
would wish they hadn't. If one died he seemed relieved,<lb>
and surveyed him with pensive satisfaction, saying<lb>
heartily, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's comfortable, now, poor soul, and well out of<lb>
this miserable world, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for Ben the sanitary influences of the doctor's<lb>
ward would have been small, and Dante's doleful line<lb>
might have been written on the threshold of the door, &mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;Who enters here leaves hope behind.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>Ben and the doctor perfectly understood and liked each<lb>
other, but never agreed, and always skirmished over the<lb>
boys as if manful cheerfulness and medical despair were<lb>
fighting for the soul and body of each one.</p>
<pb n="340">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began the doctor, looking at Sam's arm, or,<lb>
rather, all that was left of that member after two amputations,<lb>
&ldquo;we shall be ready for another turn at this in a<lb>
day or two if it don't mend faster. Tetanus sometimes<lb>
follows such cases, but that is soon over, and I should<lb>
not object to a case of it, by way of variety.&rdquo; Sam's<lb>
hopeful face fell, and he set his teeth as if the fatal<lb>
symptoms were already felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one kind of lockjaw was more prevailing than'<lb>
tis, it wouldn't be a bad thing for some folks I could<lb>
mention,&rdquo; observed Ben, covering the well-healed stump<lb>
as carefully as if it were a sleeping baby; adding, as the<lb>
doctor walked away, &ldquo;There's a sanguinary old sawbones<lb>
for you! Why, bless your buttons, Sam, you are<lb>
doing splendid, and he goes on that way because there's<lb>
no chance of his having another cut at you! Now he's<lb>
squenchin' Turner, jest as we've blowed a spark of spirit<lb>
into him. If ever there was a born extinguisher its<lb>
Bangs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben rushed to the rescue, and not a minute too soon;<lb>
for Turner, who now labored under the delusion that his<lb>
recovery depended solely upon his getting out of bed<lb>
every fifteen minutes, was sitting by the fire, looking up<lb>
at the doctor, who pleasantly observed, while feeling his<lb>
pulse, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are getting ready for another fever, are you?<lb>
Well, we've grown rather fond of you, and will keep you<lb>
six weeks longer if you have set your heart on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner looked nervous, for the doctor's jokes were<lb>
always grim ones; but Ben took the other hand in his,<lb>
and gently rocked the chair as he replied, with great<lb>
politeness, &mdash;</p>
<pb n="341">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-360">

<figdesc>Page 341.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;This robust convalescent of ourn would be happy to<lb>
oblige you, sir, but he has a pressin' engagement up to<lb>
Jersey for next week, and couldn't stop on no account.<lb>
You see Miss Turner wants a careful nuss for little<lb>
Georgie, and he's a goin' to take the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling himself on the brink of a laugh as Turner simpered<lb>
with a ludicrous mixture of pride in his baby and<lb>
fear for himself, Dr. Bangs said, with unusual sternness<lb>
and a glance at Ben, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the responsibility of this step upon yourself,<lb>
do you? Very well; then I wash my hands of<lb>
Turner; only, if that bed is empty in a week, don't lay<lb>
the blame of it at my door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing shall induce me to do it, sir,&rdquo; briskly responded<lb>
Ben. &ldquo;Now then, turn in my boy, and sleep your<lb>
prettiest, for I wouldn't but disappoint that cheerfulest of<lb>
men for a month's wages; and that's liberal, as I ain't<lb>
likely to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this young man after the rash dissipations of<lb>
the day?&rdquo; asked the doctor, pausing at the bed in the<lb>
corner, after he had made a lively progress down the<lb>
room, hotly followed by Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm first-rate, sir,&rdquo; panted Joe, who always said so,<lb>
though each day found him feebler than the last. Every<lb>
one was kind to Joe, even the gruff doctor, whose manner<lb>
softened, and who was forced to frown heavily to<lb>
hide the pity in his eyes</p>
<p>&ldquo;How's the cough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, sir; being weaker, I can't fight against it as<lb>
I used to do, so it comes rather easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep any last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much; but it's very pleasant laying here when<lb>
<pb n="342">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-361">

<figdesc>Page 342.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the room is still, and no light but the fire. Ben keeps it<lb>
bright; and, when I fret, he talks to me, and makes the<lb>
time go telling stories till he gets so sleepy he can hardly<lb>
speak. Dear old Ben! I hope he'll have some one as<lb>
kind to him, when he needs it as I do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will get what he deserves by-and-by, you may<lb>
be sure of that,&rdquo; said the doctor, as severely as if Ben<lb>
merited eternal condemnation.</p>
<p>A great drop splashed down upon the hearth as Joe<lb>
spoke; but Ben put his foot on it, and turned about as<lb>
if defying any one to say he shed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the perverse and reckless women whom I have<lb>
known in the course of a forty years' practice, this one<lb>
is the most perverse and reckless,&rdquo; said the doctor,<lb>
abruptly addressing Miss Hale, who just then appeared,<lb>
bringing Joe's &ldquo;posy-basket&rdquo; back. &ldquo;You will oblige<lb>
me, ma'am, by sitting in this chair with your hands folded<lb>
for twenty minutes; the clock will then strike nine, and<lb>
you will go straight up to your bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Hale demurely sat down, and the doctor ponderously<lb>
departed, sighing regretfully as he went through<lb>
the room, as if disappointed that the whole thirty were<lb>
not lying at death's door; but on the threshold he turned<lb>
about, exclaimed &ldquo;Good-night, boys! God bless you!&rdquo;<lb>
and vanished as precipitately as if a trap-door had swallowed<lb>
him up.</p>
<p>Miss Hale was a perverse woman in some things; for,<lb>
instead of folding her tired hands, she took a rusty-covered<lb>
volume from the mantle-piece, and, sitting by Joe's<lb>
bed, began to read aloud. One by one all other sounds<lb>
grew still; one by one the men composed themselves to<lb>
listen; and one by one the words of the sweet old<lb>
<pb n="343">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-362">

<figdesc>Page 343.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Christmas story came to them, as the woman's quiet voice went<lb>
reading on. If any wounded spirit needed balm, if any<lb>
hungry heart asked food, if any upright purpose, newborn<lb>
aspiration, or sincere repentance wavered for want<lb>
of human strength, all found help, hope, and consolation<lb>
in the beautiful and blessed influences of the book, the<lb>
reader, and the hour.</p>
<p>The bells rung nine, the lights grew dim, the day's<lb>
work was done; but Miss Hale lingered beside Joe's bed,<lb>
for his face wore a wistful look, and he seemed loath to<lb>
have her go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what can I do for<lb>
you before I leave you to Ben's care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her nearer, and whispered earnestly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's something that I know you'll do for me, because<lb>
I can't do it for myself, not as I want it done, and you<lb>
can. I'm going pretty fast now, ma'am; and when &mdash;<lb>
when some one else is laying here, I want you to tell the<lb>
boys, &mdash; every one, from Ben to Barney, &mdash; how much I<lb>
thanked 'em, how much I loved 'em, and how glad I<lb>
was that I had known 'em, even for such a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Joe, I'll tell them all. What else can I do,<lb>
my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only let me say to you what no one else must say for<lb>
me, that all I want to live for is to try and do something<lb>
in my poor way to show you how I thank you, ma'am. It<lb>
isn't what you've said to me, it isn't what you've done<lb>
for me alone, that makes me grateful; it's because you've<lb>
learned me many things without knowing it, showed me<lb>
what I ought to have been before, if I'd had any one to<lb>
tell me how, and made this such a happy, home-like<lb>
place, I shall be sorry when I have to go.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>Poor Joe! it must have fared hardly with him all<lb>
those twenty years, if a hospital seemed home-like, and<lb>
a little sympathy, a little care, could fill him with such<lb>
earnest gratitude. He stopped a moment to lay his cheek<lb>
upon the hand he held in both of his, then hurried on as<lb>
if he felt his breath beginning to give out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say many boys have said this to you, ma'am,<lb>
better than I can, for I don't say half I feel; but I know<lb>
that none of 'em ever thanked you as I thank you in my<lb>
heart, or ever loved you as I'll love you all my life.<lb>
To-day I hadn't anything to give you, I'm so poor; but<lb>
I wanted to tell you this, on the last Christmas I shall<lb>
ever see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very humble kiss he gave that hand; but the<lb>
fervor of a first love warmed it, and the sincerity of a<lb>
great gratitude made it both a precious and pathetic gift<lb>
to one who, half unconsciously, had made this brief and<lb>
barren life so rich and happy at its close. Always<lb>
womanly and tender, Miss Hale's face was doubly so as<lb>
she leaned over him, whispering, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had my present, now. Good-night, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE clock struck eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look again, Gabriel; is there no light coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a ray, mother, and the night seems to darken<lb>
every instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, half an hour is time enough to reach the<lb>
main land and find Dr. Firth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ample time; but Alec probably found the doctor absent,<lb>
and is waiting for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I bade the boy leave my message, and return at<lb>
once. Every moment is precious; what can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An impatient sigh was the only answer vouchsafed to<lb>
the unpalatable advice, and silence fell again upon the<lb>
anxious watchers in the room. Still leaning in the deep<lb>
recess of the window, the young man looked out into the<lb>
murky night, listened to the flow of the great river rolling<lb>
to the sea, and let the unquiet current of his thoughts<lb>
drift him whithersoever it would. His imaginative temperament<lb>
found a sad similitude between the night and<lb>
his own mood, for neither his physical nor mental eye<lb>
could see what lay before him, and in his life there<lb>
seemed to have come an hour as full of suspense, as<lb>
prophetic of storm, as that which now oppressed the earth<lb>
and lowered in the sky.</p>

</p>
<p>Every instant that brought the peace of death nearer<lb>
to the father, also brought the cares of life nearer to the<lb>
son, and their grim aspect daunted him. The child of a<lb>
Northern mother, bred at the North by her dying desire,<lb>
he had been summoned home to take the old man's place,<lb>
and receive a slave-cursed inheritance into his keeping.<lb>
Had he stood alone, his task would have been an easy<lb>
one; for an upright nature, an enthusiastic spirit, would<lb>
have found more sweetness than bitterness in a sacrifice<lb>
made for conscience sake, more pride than pain in a just<lb>
deed generously performed. But a step-mother and her<lb>
daughters were dependent on him now, for the old man's<lb>
sudden seizure left him no time to make provision for<lb>
them; and the son found a double burden laid upon his<lb>
shoulders when he returned to what for years had been a<lb>
loveless home to him. To reduce three delicately nurtured<lb>
women to indigence seemed a cruel and Quixotic<lb>
act to others, a very hard, though righteous one to him;<lb>
for poverty looked less terrible than affluence founded<lb>
upon human blood and tears. He had resolved to set<lb>
aside all private ambitions and aspirations that he might<lb>
dedicate his life to his kindred; had manfully withstood<lb>
their ridicule and reproaches, and only faltered when, in<lb>
their hour of bereavement, they appealed to him with<lb>
tears and prayers. Then pity threatened to conquer<lb>
principle, for Gabriel's heart was as gentle as it was generous.<lb>
Three days of sorrowful suspense and inward strife<lb>
had passed; now death seemed about to set its seal upon<lb>
one life, and irresolution to mar another, for Gabriel still<lb>
wavered between duty and desire, crying within himself,<lb>
&ldquo;Lord, help me! I see the right, but I am not strong<lb>
enough to do it; let it be decided for me.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>It was &mdash; suddenly, entirely, and forever!</p>
<p>The tinkle of a bell roused him from his moody reverie,<lb>
and, without quitting the shadow of the half-drawn curtain,<lb>
he watched the scene before him with the interest<lb>
of one in whom both soul and sense were alert to interpret<lb>
and accept the divine decree which he had asked, in<lb>
whatever guise it came.</p>
<p>The bell summoned a person whose entrance seemed<lb>
to bring warmth, vitality and light into that gloomy room,<lb>
although she was only a servant, with the blood of a<lb>
despised race in her veins. More beautiful than either<lb>
of her young mistresses, she looked like some brilliant<lb>
flower of the tropics beside two pale exotics, and the<lb>
unavoidable consciousness of this showed itself in the<lb>
skill with which she made her simple dress a foil to her<lb>
beauty, in the carriage of her graceful head and the sad<lb>
pride of her eyes, as if, being denied all the other rights<lb>
of womanhood, the slave clung to and cherished the one<lb>
possession which those happier women lacked. As she<lb>
entered, noiselessly, she gave one keen, comprehensive<lb>
glance about the room, &mdash; a glance that took in the gray<lb>
head and pallid face upon the pillow, the languid lady<lb>
sitting at the bedside, the young sisters spent with weeping<lb>
and watching, half asleep in either corner of a couch,<lb>
and the man's glove that lay beside a brace of pistols on<lb>
a distant table. Then her eyes fell, all expression faded<lb>
from her face, and she stood before her mistress with a<lb>
meek air, curiously at variance with the animated aspect<lb>
she had worn on entering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly, are you sure you gave Alec my message correctly?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Mrs. Butler, imperiously, with a look of<lb>
unconcealed dislike.</p>
<pb n="348">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, missis, I gave it word for word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice that answered would have gone straight to a<lb>
stranger's heart and made it ache, for a world of hopeless<lb>
patience rendered its music pathetic, and dignified the<lb>
little speech, as if the woman's spirit uttered a protest in<lb>
every word that passed her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been gone nearly an hour. I can wait no<lb>
longer. Tell Andy to go at once and see what keeps him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy's down at the landing, seeing to the boats<lb>
before the storm, missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Tony do that, and send Andy off at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony's too cut up with his last whipping to stir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very tiresome! Where is overseer Neal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick, missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick! I saw him two hours ago, and he was perfectly<lb>
well then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was taken very suddenly, but he'll be out of<lb>
pain by morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Milly spoke, with a slight motion of the lips that<lb>
would have been a scornful smile had she not checked it, a<lb>
faint, far-off cry came on the wind; a cry of mortal fear<lb>
or pain it seemed, and so full of ominous suggestion that,<lb>
though inured to sounds of suffering, Mrs. Butler involuntarily<lb>
exclaimed, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's only Rachel screaming for her baby; the last<lb>
thing old master did was to sell it, and she's been crazy<lb>
ever since,&rdquo; answered Milly, with a peculiar quickening<lb>
of the breath and a sidelong glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish creature! but never mind her now: tell me<lb>
who is about that I can send for Dr. Firth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's no one in the house but blind Sandra and me.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Who gave the people leave<lb>
to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitherto the girl had spoken in the subdued tone of a<lb>
well-trained servant, though there was no trace of her<lb>
race in her speech but a word or two here and there; for<lb>
Milly's beauty had secured for her all the advantages<lb>
which would increase her value as a chattel. But in the<lb>
utterance of the last two words her voice rose with a<lb>
sudden ring that arrested Mrs. Butler's attention, and<lb>
caused her to glance sharply at the girl. Milly stood<lb>
before her meek and motionless, and not an eyelash stirred<lb>
during that brief scrutiny. Her mistress could not see<lb>
the mingled triumph and abhorrence burning in those<lb>
averted eyes, did not observe the close clenching of the<lb>
hand that hung at her side, nor guess what a sea of black<lb>
and bitter memories was surging in her comely handmaid's<lb>
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dared you send the servants away without my<lb>
orders?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Butler, in an irritated and irritating<lb>
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Gabriel said the house must be kept very<lb>
quiet on old master's account; I couldn't make the boys<lb>
mind, so I sent them to the quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the first time you have presumed upon<lb>
my son's favor, and exceeded my orders. You have<lb>
been spoiled by indulgence, but that shall be altered soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, missis, &mdash; it shall;&rdquo; and as the girl added the<lb>
latter words below her breath, there was a glitter as of<lb>
white teeth firmly set lest some impetuous speech should<lb>
break loose in spite of her. Her mistress did not mark<lb>
that little demonstration, for her mind was occupied<lb>
<pb n="350">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-369">

<figdesc>Page 350.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with its one care, as she said, half aloud, half to<lb>
herself, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do? The night is passing, your master<lb>
needs help, and Alec has evidently forgotten, or never<lb>
received, my message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time an expression of anxiety was visible<lb>
on Milly's face, and there was more eagerness than<lb>
deference in her suggestion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Gabriel might go; it would save time and<lb>
make the matter sure, as missis doubts my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible; his father might rouse and ask for<lb>
him, and I will not be left alone. It is not his place to<lb>
carry messages, nor yours to propose it. Quick! lift your<lb>
master's head, and chafe his hands. God help us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low sigh from the bed caused the sudden change<lb>
from displeasure to distress, as Mrs. Butler bent over her<lb>
husband, forgetful of all else. What a strange smile<lb>
flashed across Milly's face, and kindled the dark fire of<lb>
her eyes, as she looked down upon the master and mistress,<lb>
whose helplessness and grief touched no chord of<lb>
pity or sympathy in her heart! Only an instant did she<lb>
stand so, but in that instant the expression of her face<lb>
was fully revealed, not to the drowsy sisters, but to<lb>
Gabriel in his covert. He saw it, but before he could<lb>
fathom its significance it was hidden from him; and when<lb>
his mother looked up there was nothing to be seen but<lb>
the handsome head bending over the pale hand that Milly<lb>
was assiduously chafing. Something in the touch of<lb>
those warm palms seemed to rouse in the old man a<lb>
momentary flicker of memory and strength, for the last<lb>
thought that that had disturbed his failing consciousness<lb>
found utterance in broken words:</p>
<pb n="351">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-370">

<figdesc>Page 351.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised her her liberty, &mdash; she shall have it; wait<lb>
a little, Milly, &mdash; wait till I am better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, master, I can wait now;&rdquo; and the girl's eye<lb>
turned toward the clock with an impatient glance.</p>
<p>The old man did not hear her, for, with an incoherent<lb>
murmur, he seemed to sink into a deeper lethargy than<lb>
before. His wife believed him dying; and cried, as she<lb>
wrung her hands in a paroxysm of despairing helplessness, &mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Milly, look out! and if no one is coming,<lb>
run to the quarters and send off the first boy you meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly moved deliberately toward the window, but<lb>
paused half-way to ask, with the same shade of anxiety<lb>
flitting over her face, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Master Gabriel? shouldn't he be called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here a moment ago, and has gone to the<lb>
landing, doubtless; you can call him as you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With sudden eagerness the girl glided to the window,<lb>
now too intent upon some purpose of her own to see the<lb>
dark outline of a figure half concealed in the deep folds<lb>
of the curtain; and, leaning far out, she peered into<lb>
the gloom with an intentness that sharpened every<lb>
feature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one coming, missis,&rdquo; she said, raising<lb>
her voice unnecessarily, as one listener thought, unless<lb>
the momentary stillness made any sound seem unusually<lb>
loud. As the words left her lips, from below there came<lb>
a soft chirp as of some restless bird; it was twice repeated,<lb>
then came a pause, and in it, with a rapid, noiseless<lb>
gesture, Milly drew a handkerchief from her pocket<lb>
and dropped it from the window. It fluttered whitely<lb>
for a moment, and as it disappeared an acute ear might<lb>
<pb n="352">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-371">

<figdesc>Page 352.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
have caught the sound of footsteps stealing stealthily<lb>
away. Milly evidently heard them, for an expression of<lb>
relief began to dawn upon her face. Suddenly it changed<lb>
to one of terror, as, in the act of withdrawing her arm,<lb>
a strong hand grasped it, and Gabriel's voice demanded, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she struggled like some wild creature<lb>
caught in a net, then steadied herself by a desperate<lb>
effort, exclaiming, breathlessly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Master Gabriel, how you frightened me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to. Now tell what all this means, at once<lb>
and truly,&rdquo; he said, in a tone intended to be stern, but<lb>
which was only serious and troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All what means, sir?&rdquo; she answered, feigning innocent<lb>
surprise, though her eye never met his, and she still<lb>
trembled in his hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know; the signals, the dropping of the handkerchief,<lb>
the steps below there, and the figure creeping<lb>
through the grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master must have quick eyes and ears to see and<lb>
hear all that in such a minute. I only saw my handkerchief<lb>
drop by accident; I only heard a bird chirp, and<lb>
one of the dogs creep round the house;&rdquo; but as she<lb>
spoke she cast an uneasy glance over her shoulder into<lb>
the night without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why lie to me, Milly? I have watched you ever<lb>
since you came in, and you are not yourself to-night.<lb>
Something is wrong; I've felt it all day, but thought it<lb>
was anxiety for my poor father. Why are all the people<lb>
sent off to the quarters? Why is Andy meddling with<lb>
the boats without my orders? and why do you look,<lb>
speak, and act in this inexplicable manner?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="353">
<p>

</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="23">
<p>&ldquo;If master gets worried and imagines mischief when<lb>
there is none, I can't help it,&rdquo; she said, doggedly.</p>
<p>Both while speaking and listening Gabriel had scrutinized<lb>
her closely, and all he saw confirmed his suspicion<lb>
that something serious was amiss. In the slender wrist<lb>
he held the pulse thrilled quick and strong; he heard the<lb>
rapid beating of her heart, the flutter of the breath upon<lb>
her lips; saw that her face was colorless, her eyes both<lb>
restless and elusive. He was sure that no transient fear<lb>
agitated her, but felt that some unwonted excitement possessed<lb>
her, threatenening to break out in spite of the<lb>
self-control which years of servitude had taught her.<lb>
What he had just seen and heard alarmed him; for his<lb>
father had been a hard master, the island was governed<lb>
by fear alone, and he never trod the dykes that bounded<lb>
the long, low rice-fields without feeling as if he walked<lb>
upon a crater-crust which might crack and spew fire any<lb>
day. Many small omens of evil had occurred of<lb>
late, which now returned to his recollection with sinister<lb>
significance; and the vague disquiet that had haunted<lb>
him all day now seemed an instinctive premonition of<lb>
impending danger. Many fears flashed through his mind,<lb>
and one resolution was firmly fixed. His face grew stern,<lb>
his voice commanding, and his hand tightened its hold<lb>
as he said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Milly, or I shall be tempted to use my authority<lb>
as a master, and that I never wish to do. If there<lb>
is any deviltry afloat I must know it; and if you will not<lb>
tell it me I shall search the island till I find it for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him for the first time, as he spoke, with<lb>
a curious blending of defiance for the master and admiration<lb>
for the man. His last words changed it to one of<lb>
<pb n="354">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-373">

<figdesc>Page 354.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fear; and her free hand was extended as if to bar his<lb>
way, while she said, below her breath, and with another<lb>
glance into the outer gloom, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are safe here, but if you leave the house it will<lb>
cost you your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must; for if you will not show me the peril,<lb>
I swear I'll go to meet it blindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, wait a little; I dare not tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall tell. I am the mistress here, and have<lb>
borne enough. Speak, girl, at once, or this proud spirit<lb>
of yours shall be broken till you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Butler had heard all that passed, had approached<lb>
them, and being a woman who was by turns imperious,<lb>
peevish, and passionate, she yielded to the latter impulse<lb>
as she spoke, and gave the girl's shoulder an impatient<lb>
shake, as if to force the truth out of her. The touch,<lb>
the tone, were like sparks to powder; for the smouldering<lb>
fire blazed up as Milly flung her off, wrenched herself<lb>
free from Gabriel, and turned on his mother with a<lb>
look that sent her back to her husband trembling and<lb>
dismayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will speak, though it is too soon!&rdquo; cried<lb>
Milly, with a short, sharp laugh. &ldquo;They may kill me<lb>
for telling before the time; I can't help it; I must have<lb>
one hour of freedom, if I die the next. There <hi rend="italics">is</hi> deviltry<lb>
afloat to-night, and it is yourselves you may blame<lb>
for it. We can't bear any more, and before a new master<lb>
comes to torment us like the old one, we've determined<lb>
to try for liberty, though there'll be bloody work before<lb>
we get it. The boys are not at the quarters, but fifty<lb>
are waiting at the rice-mill till midnight, and then they'll<lb>
come up here to do as they've been done by. While<lb>
<pb n="355">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-374">

<figdesc>Page 355.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
they wait they're beginning with overseer Neal; whipping,<lb>
burning, torturing him, for all I know, as other<lb>
men, and women too, have been whipped, burnt and<lb>
tortured there. That was his scream you heard. Alec<lb>
never went for the doctor; Andy's guarding the boats<lb>
till we want them; big Mose is watching round the<lb>
house; the alarm bell's down; I've cleared the house of<lb>
arms, and spoilt the pistols that I dared not take; Master<lb>
Gabriel's the only white man on the island, and there's<lb>
no help for you unless the Lord turns against us. Who<lb>
is the mistress now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl paused there, breathless but exultant, for the<lb>
words had poured from her lips as if the pent-up degradation,<lb>
wrath and wrong of nineteen years had broken<lb>
bounds at last and must overflow, even though they<lb>
wrecked her by their vehemence. Some spirit stronger<lb>
than herself seemed to possess and speak out of her,<lb>
making her look like an embodied passion, beautiful, yet<lb>
terrible, as she glanced from face to face, seeing how pale<lb>
and panic-stricken each became, as her rapid words made<lb>
visible the retribution that hung over them. Gabriel<lb>
stood aghast at the swift and awful answer given to his<lb>
prayer; the daughters fled to their mother's arms for<lb>
shelter; the wife clung to her husband for the protection<lb>
which he could no longer give, and, as if dragged back<lb>
to life by the weight of a woe, such as he had himself<lb>
inflicted upon others, the old man rose up in his bed,<lb>
speechless, helpless, yet conscious of the dangers of the<lb>
hour, and doubly daunted by death's terrors, because so<lb>
powerless to succor those for whom he had periled his<lb>
own soul. A bitter cry broke from him as his last look<lb>
showed him the impending doom which all his impotent<lb>
<pb n="356">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-375">

<figdesc>Page 356.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
remorse could not avert, and in that cry the old man's<lb>
spirit passed, to find that, even for such as he, Infinite<lb>
justice was tempered by Infinite mercy.</p>
<p>During the few moments in which the wife and daughters<lb>
forgot fear in sorrow, and the son took hurried<lb>
counsel with himself how best to meet the coming<lb>
danger, Milly was learning that the bitter far exceeds<lb>
the sweet in human vengeance. The slave exulted in<lb>
the freedom so dearly purchased, but the woman felt that<lb>
in avenging them her wrongs had lost their dignity, and<lb>
though she had changed places with her mistress, she<lb>
found that power did not bring her peace. She had no<lb>
skill to analyze the feeling, no words in which to express<lb>
it, even to herself, but she was so strongly conscious of<lb>
it, that its mysterious power marred the joy she thought<lb>
to feel, and forced her to confess that in the hour of<lb>
expected triumph she was baffled and defeated by her<lb>
own conscience. With women doomed to a fate like<lb>
hers, the higher the order of intelligence the deeper the<lb>
sense of degradation, the more intense the yearning for<lb>
liberty at any price. Milly had always rebelled against<lb>
her lot, although, compared with that of her class, it had<lb>
not been a hard one till the elder Butler bought her, that<lb>
his son, seeing slavery in such a lovely form, might learn<lb>
to love it. But Gabriel, in his brief visits, soon convinced<lb>
his father that no temptation could undermine his sturdy<lb>
Northern sense of right and justice, and though he might<lb>
easily learn to love the beautiful woman, he could not<lb>
learn to oppress the slave whose utter helplessness appealed<lb>
to all that was manliest in him.</p>
<p>Milly felt this deeply, and knew that the few black<lb>
drops in her veins parted herself and Gabriel more<lb>
<pb n="357">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-376">

<figdesc>Page 357.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hopelessly than the widest seas that ever rolled between two<lb>
lovers. This inexorable fact made all the world look<lb>
dark to her; life became a burden, and one purpose<lb>
alone sustained her, &mdash; the resolution to achieve her own<lb>
liberty, to enjoy a brief triumph over those who had<lb>
wronged her, then to die, and find compensation for a<lb>
hapless human love in the fatherly tenderness of a Divine<lb>
one. She had prayed, worked and waited for this hour,<lb>
with all the ardor, energy and patience of her nature.<lb>
Yet when it came she was not satisfied; a sense of guilt<lb>
oppressed her, and the loss seemed greater than the gain.<lb>
Gabriel had given her a look which wounded more deeply<lb>
than the sharpest reproach; and the knowledge that she<lb>
had forfeited the confidence he had always shown her,<lb>
now made her gloomy when she would have been glad,<lb>
humble when she thought to have been proudest. Gabriel<lb>
saw and understood her mood, felt that their only<lb>
hope of deliverance lay in her, and while his mother and<lb>
sisters lamented for the dead, he bestirred himself to<lb>
save the living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly,&rdquo; he began, with sad seriousness, &ldquo;we deserve<lb>
no mercy, and I ask none for myself; I only implore you<lb>
to spare the women and give me time to atone for the<lb>
weak, the wicked hesitation which has brought us to this<lb>
pass. I meant to free you all as soon as you were legally<lb>
mine, as it was too late for my father to endear his memory<lb>
by one just act. But it was hard to make my mother<lb>
and my sisters poor, and so I waited, hoping to be shown<lb>
some way by which I could be just and generous both to<lb>
you and them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three women were more precious than two hundred<lb>
helpless creatures in the eyes of a Christian gentleman<lb>
<pb n="358">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-377">

<figdesc>Page 358.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
from the free North! I'm glad you told me this;&rdquo; and<lb>
there was something like contempt in the look she gave<lb>
her master.</p>
<p>There was no answer to that, for it was true; and in<lb>
the remorseful shame that sent the blood to Gabriel's<lb>
forehead, he confessed the fact which he was too honest<lb>
to deny. Still looking at her, with eyes that pleaded for<lb>
him better than his words, he said, with a humility that<lb>
conquered her disdain, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall expiate that sin if I die to-night; and I will<lb>
give myself up to be dealt with as you please, if you will<lb>
save my mother and my sisters, and let them free you in<lb>
my name. Before God and my dead father I promise<lb>
this, upon my honor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no witnesses to that but those whom I'll<lb>
not trust; honor means nothing to us who are not allowed<lb>
to keep our own,&rdquo; said Milly, looking moodily upon the<lb>
ground, as if she feared to look up lest she should<lb>
relent, for excitement was ebbing fast, and a flood of<lb>
regretful recollections rising in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not expect that reproach from you,&rdquo; Gabriel<lb>
answered, taking courage from the signs he saw. &ldquo;Do<lb>
you remember, when my father gave you to me, how<lb>
indignantly I rejected the gift, and promised that in my<lb>
eyes you should be as sacred as either of those poor<lb>
girls? Have I not kept my word, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! O yes!&rdquo; she said, with trembling lips, and<lb>
eyes she dared not lift, they were so full of grateful tears.<lb>
Carefully steadying her traitorous voice, she added, earnestly,<lb>
&ldquo;Master Gabriel! I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> remember, and I've tried<lb>
all day to save you, but you wouldn't go. I will trust<lb>
your word, and do my best to help the ladies, if they'll<lb>
<pb n="359">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-378">

<figdesc>Page 359.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
promise to free us all to-morrow, and you will leave the<lb>
island at once. Mose will let you pass; for that handkerchief<lb>
was dropped to tell him that you were abroad,<lb>
and were to be got off against your will, if you wouldn't<lb>
go quietly. Both he and Andy will save you for my<lb>
sake; the others won't, because they don't know you as<lb>
we do. Please go, Master Gabriel, before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shall stay. What would you think of me, if I<lb>
deserted these helpless women in such danger, to save<lb>
myself at their expense? I cannot quite trust you,<lb>
Milly, after treachery like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught us to be treacherous, and left us nothing<lb>
but our own cunning to help ourselves with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first part of Gabriel's speech made the last less<lb>
hard to bear; and Milly's question was put in a tone that<lb>
was more apologetic than accusatory, for Gabriel cared<lb>
what she thought of him, and that speech comforted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, Milly; but let the sins of the dead rest, and<lb>
tell me if you will not help my mother and Grace and<lb>
Clara off, instead of me? The promise will be all the<lb>
sooner and the better kept, or, if it comes too late, I<lb>
shall be the only and the fittest person to pay the<lb>
penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly's face darkened, and she turned away with an<lb>
expression of keen disappointment. Mrs. Butler and her<lb>
daughters had restrained their lamentations to listen; but<lb>
at the sound of Gabriel's proposal, the sisters ran to<lb>
Milly, and, clinging about her knees, implored her to<lb>
pity, forgive, and save them. Well for them that they<lb>
did so; for Milly felt as if many degradations were cancelled<lb>
by that act, and, as she saw her young mistresses<lb>
at her feet, the sense of power soothed her sore heart,<lb>
<pb n="360">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-379">

<figdesc>Page 360.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and added the grace of generosity to the duty of forgiveness.<lb>
She did not speak, yet she did not deny their<lb>
prayer, and stood wavering between doubt and desire as<lb>
the fateful moments rapidly flew by; Gabriel remembered<lb>
that, and, taking her hand, said, in a voice whose earnestness<lb>
was perilously persuasive to the poor girl's ear, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly, you said there was no hope for us unless God<lb>
turned against you. I think He has, and, speaking<lb>
through that generous heart of yours, pleads for us better<lb>
than we can plead for ourselves. It is so beautiful to<lb>
pity, so magnanimous to forgive; and the greater the<lb>
wrong, the more pardon humbles the transgressor and<lb>
ennobles the bestower. Dear Milly, spare these poor<lb>
girls as you have been spared; prove yourself the truer<lb>
woman, the nobler mistress; teach them a lesson which<lb>
they never can forget, and sweeten your liberty with the<lb>
memory of this act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly listened still with downcast eyes and averted<lb>
face, but every word went straight to her heart, soothing,<lb>
strengthening, inspiring all that was best and bravest in<lb>
that poor heart, so passionate, and yet so warm and<lb>
womanly withal. No man had ever spoken to her before<lb>
of magnanimity, of proving herself superior to those<lb>
who had shown no mercy to her faults, accorded no<lb>
praise to her virtues, nor lightened a hard servitude<lb>
with any touch of friendliness. No man had ever looked<lb>
into her face before with eyes in which admiration for<lb>
her beauty was mingled with pity for her helpless womanhood;<lb>
and, better than all, no man, old or young, had<lb>
ever until now recognized in her a fellow-creature, born<lb>
to the same rights, gifted with the same powers, and<lb>
capable of the same sufferings and sacrifices as himself.<lb>
<pb n="361">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-380">

<figdesc>Page 361.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
That touched and won her; that appealed to the spirit<lb>
which lives through all oppression in the lowest of God's<lb>
children; and through all her frame there went a glow<lb>
of warmth and joy, as if some strong, kind hand had<lb>
lifted her from the gloom of a desolate despair into the<lb>
sunshine of a happier world. Her eye wandered toward<lb>
the faces of dead master, conquered mistress, and darkened<lb>
as it looked; passed to the pale girls still clinging<lb>
to her skirts, and softened visibly; was lifted to Gabriel,<lb>
and kindled with the new-born desire to prove herself<lb>
worthy of the confidence which would be her best reward.<lb>
A smile broke beautifully across her face, and<lb>
her lips were parted to reply, when Mrs. Butler, who<lb>
sat trembling behind her, cried, in a shrill, imploring<lb>
whisper, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember all I've done for you, Milly, all I still<lb>
have it in my power to do. I promise to free you, if you<lb>
will only save us now. Be merciful, for your old<lb>
master's sake, if not for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of that querulous voice seemed to sting<lb>
Milly like a lash, threatening to undo all Gabriel's work.<lb>
Her eye grew fiery again, her mouth hard, her face bitterly<lb>
scornful, as she said, with a glance which her mistress<lb>
never forgot, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not likely to forget all you've done for me; I<lb>
would not accept my liberty from you if you could give<lb>
it; and if a word of mine could save you, I'd not say<lb>
it for old master's sake, much less for yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a warning gesture to his mother, Gabriel turned<lb>
that defiant face toward himself, and holding it firmly<lb>
yet gently between his hands, bent on it a look that<lb>
allayed the rising storm by the magic of a power which<lb>
<pb n="362">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-381">

<figdesc>Page 362.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the young man had never used till now, though conscious<lb>
of possessing it, &mdash; for Milly's tell-tale countenance had<lb>
betrayed her secret long ago. As he looked deep into<lb>
her eyes, with a glance which was both commanding and<lb>
compassionate, they first fell with sudden shame, then,<lb>
as if controlled by the power of those other eyes, they<lb>
rose again and met them with a sad sincerity that made<lb>
their beauty tragical, as they filled slowly till two great<lb>
tears rolled down her cheeks, wetting the hands that<lb>
touched them; and when Gabriel said, softly, &ldquo;For<lb>
my sake you will save us?&rdquo; she straightway answered,<lb>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Milly! Now tell me how I am to<lb>
help you, for time is going, and lives hang on the<lb>
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released her as he spoke; and, though she still<lb>
looked at him as if he were the one saving power of her<lb>
thwarted life, she answered, pleadingly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Master Gabriel! please don't speak to me, for<lb>
then I only feel, &mdash; now I must think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How still the room grew as they waited! The presence<lb>
of death was less solemn than that of fear, for the<lb>
dead seemed forgotten, and the living all unconscious of<lb>
the awesome contrast between the pale expectancy of<lb>
their panic-stricken faces and the repose of that one untroubled<lb>
countenance. How suddenly the night grew<lb>
full of ominous sounds! How intently all eyes were<lb>
fixed upon the beautiful woman who stood among them<lb>
holding their lives in her hands, and how they started,<lb>
when, through the hush, came a soft chime as the halfhour<lb>
struck! Milly heard and answered that silvery<lb>
sound as the anxious watchers would have had her:</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be done,&rdquo; she said, in a tone which carried<lb>
hope to every heart. &ldquo;It can be done, but I must do it<lb>
alone, for I can pass Mose and get Andy across the river<lb>
without their suspecting that I'm going for help. You<lb>
must stay here and do your best to guard the ladies,<lb>
Master Gabriel; it won't be safe for any of you to go<lb>
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Milly, the boys may not wait till twelve, or you<lb>
may be delayed, and then we are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that; and as I go out I'll take old<lb>
Sandra with me; she'll understand in a minute. She'll<lb>
go down to the mill and talk to them and keep them, if<lb>
anything can do it, for they love and fear her more than<lb>
any one on the island. Be quiet, trust to me, and I'll<lb>
save you, Master Gabriel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He silently held out his hand, as if pledging his word<lb>
to obey and trust. With the warmth and grace of her<lb>
impulsive temperament, Milly bent her head, laid her<lb>
cheek against that friendly hand, wet it with grateful<lb>
tears, kissed it with loving lips, and went her way, feeling<lb>
as if all things were possible to her for Gabriel's<lb>
sake.</p>
<p>Listening breathlessly, they heard her foot-falls die<lb>
away, heard Sandra's voice below, a short parley with<lb>
Mose, then watched the old woman and the young depart<lb>
in opposite directions, leaving them to feel the bitterness<lb>
of dependence in a strange, stern fashion, which they had<lb>
never thought to know. Man-like, Gabriel could not long<lb>
stand idle while danger menaced and women faced it for<lb>
him. Anxious to take such precautions as might hold<lb>
the expected assailants at bay, even for a moment, he<lb>
bade his mother and sisters remain quiet, that no<lb>
<pb n="364">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-383">

<figdesc>Page 364.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
suspicion might be excited, and crept down to test the capabilities<lb>
of the house to withstand a short siege, if other<lb>
hopes failed. The slight, many-doored and windowed<lb>
mansion, built for a brief occupancy when the winter<lb>
months rendered the region habitable for whites, was but<lb>
ill-prepared to repel any attack; and a hasty survey<lb>
convinced Gabriel that it was both hazardous and vain<lb>
to attempt a barricade which a few strong arms could<lb>
instantly destroy. As he stood disheartened, unarmed,<lb>
and alone in the long hall, dimly lighted by the lamp he<lb>
carried, a sense of utter desolation came over him,<lb>
dampening his courage, and oppressing his mind with the<lb>
dreariest forebodings. Thinking of the many true hearts<lb>
and stout arms far away there at the North, which would<lb>
have come to his aid so readily could his need have been<lb>
known, he yearned for a single friend, a single weapon,<lb>
that he might conquer or die like a man. And both<lb>
were given him.</p>
<p>Pausing before a door that opened out upon the rear<lb>
of the house, his eye caught sight of a heavy whip, whose<lb>
loaded handle had felled men before now, and might<lb>
easily do so again, if wielded by a strong arm. He took<lb>
it down, saying to himself, &ldquo;It is the first time I ever<lb>
touched the accursed thing; God grant that it may be<lb>
the last.&rdquo; A low sound behind him caused the blood<lb>
to chill an instant in his veins, then to rush on with a<lb>
quicker flow, as, poising the weapon in one hand, he<lb>
lifted the lamp above his head, and searched the gloom.<lb>
Far at the other end of the long hall a dark figure crept<lb>
along, and a pair of glittering eyes were fixed upon his<lb>
own. &ldquo;Come on; I'm ready,&rdquo; he said, steadily, and<lb>
was answered by the patter of rapid steps, the sight of<lb>
<pb n="365">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-384">

<figdesc>Page 365.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
an unexpected ally, as a great black hound came leaping<lb>
upon him in a rapture of canine delight. Old Mort had<lb>
been the fiercest, most efficient blood-hound on the island;<lb>
and still, in spite of age, was a formidable beast, ready<lb>
to track or assault a negro, and pull him down or throttle<lb>
him, at word of command. He had been his possessor's<lb>
favorite till Gabriel came; then he deserted the<lb>
old master for the young, and was always left at large<lb>
when he was at home. Mort had been missing all day,<lb>
and now the rope trailing behind him was sufficient evidence<lb>
that he had been decoyed away, lest his vigilance<lb>
should warn his master, and that, having freed himself,<lb>
he had stolen home, to lie concealed till night and his<lb>
master's presence reassured him.</p>
<p>As the great creature reared himself before the young<lb>
man, with a paw on either shoulder, and looked into his<lb>
face with eyes that seemed almost human in their intelligent<lb>
affection, Gabriel dropped the whip, put down the<lb>
lamp, and caressed the hound with an almost boyish<lb>
gratitude and fondness; for, with the sense of security<lb>
this powerful ally brought, there came a remorseful<lb>
memory, that, though the possessor of two hundred<lb>
human beings, he had no friend but a dog. At this<lb>
point Mort suddenly pricked up his ears, slipped from<lb>
his master's hold, and snuffed suspiciously at the closed<lb>
door. Some one was evidently without, and the creature's<lb>
keen scent detected the unseen listener. With a<lb>
noiseless command to the dog to keep quiet, Gabriel<lb>
caught up his only weapon, and stood waiting for whatever<lb>
demonstration should follow. None came; and<lb>
presently Mort returned to him with a sagacious glance<lb>
and a sleepy yawn, sure evidences that Mose had paused<lb>
<pb n="366">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-385">

<figdesc>Page 366.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
a moment in his round, and had gone on again. Big<lb>
Mose was, with one exception, the strongest, most rebellious<lb>
slave on the place; and though Gabriel had longed<lb>
to rush out and attack him, he had not dared to try it,<lb>
for his strength was as a child's compared to the stalwart<lb>
slave's. Now, with Mort to help him, the thing was<lb>
possible; and as he stood there, with only a door between<lb>
him and the man who had sworn to take his life,<lb>
a strange consciousness of power came to him; his muscles<lb>
seemed to grow firm as iron, his blood flowed calm<lb>
and cool, and in his mind there rose a purpose, desperately<lb>
simple, yet wise, despite its seeming rashness. He<lb>
would master Mose, and, leaving Mort to guard him,<lb>
would go down to the mill, and, if both Sandra's and<lb>
his own appeals and promises proved unavailing, would<lb>
give himself up, hoping that his death or torture would<lb>
delay the doom of those defenceless women, and give<lb>
Milly time to bring them better help than any he could<lb>
give. Some atonement must be made, he thought, and<lb>
perhaps innocent blood would wash the black stain from<lb>
his father's memory better than the deed he had hoped<lb>
to do in that father's name on the morrow. He had held<lb>
a precious opportunity in his hands, had delayed through<lb>
a mistaken kindness; now it was lost, perhaps forever,<lb>
and he must pay the costly price which God exacts of<lb>
those who palter with their consciences. As the thought<lb>
came, and the purpose grew, it brought with it that high<lb>
courage, that entire self-abnegation which we call heroism;<lb>
and that fateful moment made Gabriel a man.</p>
<p>A word, a gesture, put the dog upon his mettle; then<lb>
cutting away the long rope, Gabriel threw it over his<lb>
arm, unbarred the door, set it ajar, and, standing behind<lb>
<pb n="367">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-386">

<figdesc>Page 367.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
it, with the hound under his hand, he waited for Mose<lb>
to make his round. Soon Mort's restless ears gave token<lb>
of his approach; and, as the stealthy steps came stealing<lb>
on, he was with difficulty restrained; for now instinct<lb>
showed him danger, and he was as eager as his master<lb>
to be up and doing. The streak of light attracted the<lb>
man's eye. He paused, drew nearer, listened; then<lb>
softly pushed the door open, and leaned in to reconnoitre.<lb>
That instant Mort was on him, a heavy blow half<lb>
stunned him, and, before his scattered wits could be collected,<lb>
he was down, his hands fast bound, and both<lb>
master and dog standing over him panting, but unhurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mose, if you want to save your life, be still,<lb>
and answer my questions truly,&rdquo; said Gabriel, with one<lb>
hand on the man's throat, the other holding back Mort,<lb>
whose tawny eye was savage now. &ldquo;I know your plot,<lb>
and have found means to spoil it. How do you think<lb>
I'm going to punish you all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dun'no, massa,&rdquo; muttered Mose, with a grim resignation<lb>
to any fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm going to free every man, woman, and child on<lb>
the island, and fling that devilish thing into the river,&rdquo;<lb>
he said, as he spurned the whip with his foot.</p>
<p>An incredulous look and derisive grin was the only<lb>
thanks and answer he received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't believe it? Well, who can blame you, poor<lb>
soul? Not I. Now tell me how many men are on the<lb>
watch between here and the rice-mill?&rdquo; Gabriel spoke<lb>
with a flash of the eye and a sudden deepening of the<lb>
voice; for both indignation and excitement stirred him.<lb>
The look, the tone, did more to convince Mose than a<lb>
flood of words; for he had learned to try men by tests<lb>
<pb n="368">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-387">

<figdesc>Page 368.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of his own, and had more faith in the promises of their<lb>
faces than those of their tongues. More respectfully,<lb>
he said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, 'sides me, massa. Andy's at de landin',<lb>
and de rest at de mill 'ceptin' dem as isn't in de secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind, no lies, Mose, or your free papers will be the<lb>
last I sign to-morrow. Get up, and come quietly with<lb>
me; for it you try to run, Mort will pin you. I'm going<lb>
to the mill, and want you safely under lock and key first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is massa gwine alone?&rdquo; asked Mose, glancing about<lb>
him, for Gabriel spoke as if he had a score of men at<lb>
his command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'm going alone; why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massa knows dere's fifty of de boys dar sworn to<lb>
kill him, if Milly don't git him 'way 'fore dey comes up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, and Milly's done her best to get me off, but<lb>
I'd rather stay; I'm not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriel's blood was up now: danger had no terrors<lb>
for him; and, beyond the excitement of the moment, his<lb>
purpose lent him a calm courage which impressed the<lb>
slave as something superhuman. Like one in a maze of<lb>
doubt and fear, he obediently followed his master to an<lb>
out-house, where, binding feet as well as hands, Gabriel<lb>
left him with the promise and the warning, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit here till I come to let you out a free man, if I<lb>
live to do it. Don't stir nor call, for Mort will be at the<lb>
door to silence you and howl for me, if you try any<lb>
tricks. I'll not keep you long, if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slave only stared dumbly at him, incapable of<lb>
receiving the vast idea of liberty, pardon, and kindness<lb>
all at once; and bidding Mort guard both prisoner and<lb>
house, Gabriel stole along the path that wound away<lb>

<milestn unit="collation" n="24">
through grove and garden to the rice-mill, where so many<lb>
fates were soon to be decided. As he went he glanced<lb>
from earth to sky, and found propitious omens everywhere.<lb>
No flowery thicket concealed a lurking foe to<lb>
clutch at him in the dark; but the fragrance of trodden<lb>
grass, the dewy touch of leaves against his cheek, the<lb>
peaceful night-sounds that surrounded him, gave him<lb>
strange comfort and encouragement; for when his fellowcreatures<lb>
had deserted, Nature took him to her motherly<lb>
heart. From above, fitful glimpses of the moon guided<lb>
him on his perilous way; for the wind had changed, the<lb>
black clouds were driving seaward, and the storm was<lb>
passing without either thunderbolt or hurricane. Coming,<lb>
at length, within sight of the half-ruined mill, he paused<lb>
to reconnoitre. Through chinks in the rude walls a dim<lb>
light shone, muffled voices rose and fell; and once there<lb>
was a hoarse sound, as of a half-uttered shout. Creeping<lb>
warily to a dark nook among the ruins, Gabriel made his<lb>
way to a crevice in an inner wall, and, looking through<lb>
it, saw a sight little fitted to reassure him, either as a<lb>
master or a man.</p>
<p>The long, low-raftered portion of the mill, which once<lb>
had been the threshing-floor, was now lighted by the red<lb>
glare of several torches, which filled the place with weird<lb>
shadows, and sudden glimpses of objects that seemed the<lb>
more mysterious or terrible for being but half seen. In<lb>
one corner, under a coarse covering, something lay stark<lb>
and still; a clenched hand was visible, and several locks<lb>
of light hair dabbled with blood, but nothing more. Fifty<lb>
men, old and young, of all shades of color, all types of<lb>
their unhappy race, stood or sat about three, who evidently<lb>
were the leaders of the league. One, a young<lb>
<pb n="370">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-389">

<figdesc>Page 370.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
man, so fair that the red lines across his shoulders looked<lb>
doubly barbarous there, was half-kneeling, and steadily<lb>
filing at a chain that held his feet together as his hands<lb>
had been held till some patient friend had freed them,<lb>
and left him to finish the slow task. He worked so<lb>
eagerly that the drops stood thick upon his haggard face,<lb>
and his scarred chest heaved with his painful breath; for<lb>
this was the Tony who was too much cut up with his<lb>
last whipping to run on Mrs. Butler's errand, but not too<lb>
feeble to strike a blow for liberty. The second man was<lb>
as near an animal as a human creature could become,<lb>
and yet be recognized as such. A burly, brutal-looking<lb>
negro, maimed and distorted by every cruelty that could<lb>
be invented or inflicted, he was a sight to daunt the<lb>
stoutest heart, as he sat sharpening the knife which had<lb>
often threatened him in the overseer's hand, and was<lb>
still red with the overseer's blood.</p>
<p>Standing erect between the two, and in striking contrast<lb>
to them, was a gigantic man, with a fine, dark face,<lb>
a noble head, and the limbs of an ebony Hercules. A<lb>
native African, from one of those tribes whose wills are<lb>
never broken, &mdash; who can be subdued by kindness, but<lb>
who often kill themselves rather than suffer the degradation<lb>
of the lash. No one had dared to subject him to<lb>
that chastisement, as was proved by the unmarred smoothness<lb>
of the muscular body, bare to the waist; but round<lb>
his neck was riveted an iron collar, with four curved<lb>
spikes. It was a shameful badge of serfdom; it prevented<lb>
him from lying down, it galled him with its ceaseless<lb>
chafing, yet he wore it with an air which would have<lb>
made the hideous necklace seem some barbaric ornament,<lb>
if that had been possible; and faced the excited crowd<lb>
<pb n="371">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-390">

<figdesc>Page 371.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with a native dignity which nothing could destroy, and<lb>
which proved him their master in intelligence, as well as<lb>
strength and courage.</p>
<p>Before them all, yet lifted a little above them by her position<lb>
on a fallen fragment of the roof, stood old Cassandra.<lb>
A tall, gaunt woman, with a countenance which age,<lb>
in making venerable, had not robbed of its vigor; her<lb>
sightless eyes were wide open with a weird effect of seeing<lb>
without sight, and her high white turban, her long<lb>
staff, and the involuntary tremor of her shrivelled hands,<lb>
gave her the air of some ancient sorceress or priestess,<lb>
bearing her part in some heathen rite. The majesticlooking<lb>
slave with the collar had apparently been speaking,<lb>
for his face was turned toward her, and his dark<lb>
features were still alive with the emotions which had just<lb>
found vent in words. As Gabriel looked, old Sandra<lb>
struck the floor with her staff, as if commanding silence;<lb>
and, as the stir of some momentary outbreak subsided,<lb>
she said, in a strong voice, which rose and fell in a sort<lb>
of solemn chant as her earnestness increased and her<lb>
listeners grew obedient to its spell, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chil'en, I'se heerd yer plans, &mdash; now I wants ter len'<lb>
a han' and help you in dis hour of tribbleation. You's<lb>
killed oberseer Neal, and d'rectly you's all gwine up ter<lb>
de house to kill massa, missis and de young folks. Now<lb>
what's you gwine to do dat fer? and what's dey eber<lb>
done bad nuf ter make you willin' ter fro 'way yer souls<lb>
dis night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kase we can't b'ar no more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Old massa hunted<lb>
my boy wid hounds and dey tore him ter def.&rdquo; &ldquo;He<lb>
sold my chil'en and drove Rachel crazy wid de partin'.&rdquo;<lb>
&ldquo;Old missis had my pore girl whipped kase she was too<lb>

</eaffig>
sick ter stan' and dress her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Massa Gabriel may be<lb>
harder dan de ole one, and we's tired ob hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These, and many another short, stern answer, came<lb>
to Sandra's question; she expected them, was ready to<lb>
meet them, and knew how best to reach the outraged<lb>
hearts now hungering for vengeance. Her well-known<lb>
afflictions, her patience, her piety, gave a certain sanctity<lb>
to her presence, great weight to her words, and an<lb>
almost marvellous power to her influence over her own<lb>
people, who believed her to be half saint, half seer. She<lb>
felt her power, and, guided by an instinct that seldom<lb>
failed, she used it wisely in this perilous hour, remembering<lb>
that her listeners, though men in their passions,<lb>
were children in their feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pore boys, I knows de troof ob all dat, and I'se<lb>
had my trubbles hard and heavy as you has, but I'se<lb>
learnt to fergib 'em, and dey don't hurt now. Ole massa<lb>
bought me thirty year' ago 'way from all I keered fer,<lb>
and I'se slaved fer him widout no t'anks, no wages, eber<lb>

him dat. He shot my ole Ben kase he couldn't whip me<lb>
hisself, nor stan' by and see it done; dat mos' broke my<lb>
heart, but in de end I foun' I could fergib him one time<lb>

</p>
<p>The truth, the pathos, the devout assurance of her<lb>
words, impressed and controlled the sympathetic creatures<lb>
to whom she spoke, as no reproach or denunciation<lb>
would have done. A murmur went through the crowd,<lb>
and more than one savage face lost something of its brutality,<lb>
gained something of its former sad patience, as<lb>
the old woman touched, with wondrous skill, the chords<lb>
that still made music in these tried and tempted hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, chil'en, I hab seen de Lord, and He has made de<lb>
night into day fer me, has held me up in all my trubbles,<lb>
tole me to hole fas' by Him, and promised He would<lb>
bring me safe ter glory. I'se faith ter feel He will, and<lb>
while I wait, I'se savin' up my soul fer Him. Boys, He<lb>
says de same to you froo me; He says hole fas', b'ar all<lb>

Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We's done tired a-waitin', de Lord's so bery long a<lb>
comin', Sandra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a weary, hopeless voice that answered, as an<lb>
old man shook his white head and lifted up the dim eyes<lb>
that for eighty years had watched in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's you dat's long a-comin' ter Him, Uncle Dave,<lb>
but He ain't tired ob waitin' for yer. De places dar in<lb>
heaven is all ready, de shinin' gowns, de harps ob gole,<lb>

Dave, growed beautiful white angels, and a-waitin' till<lb>

de Lord's got her in de holler ob His han', and she's<lb>
a-waitin' fer de little one and you to come. Dar's my<lb>

I'll see 'em waitin' fer me at de door. But, best ob all,<lb>
dar's de dear Lord waitin' fer us; He's holdin' out his<lb>

knows yer won't 'spoint me ob dese yere fifty precious<lb>
souls, and I'se a-waitin', waitin', waitin' fer yer all.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>Strange fervor was in the woman's darkened face,<lb>
strange eloquence in her aged voice, strange power in<lb>
the persuasive gestures of her withered hands outstretched<lb>
above them, warning, pleading, beckoning,<lb>
as if, in truth, the Lord spoke through her, illuminating<lb>
that poor place with the light of His divine compassion,<lb>
the promises of His divine salvation. A dead<lb>
silence followed as the last yearning cadence of the one<lb>
voice rose, fell, and died away. Sandra let the strong<lb>
contrast between the here and the hereafter make its<lb>
due impression, then broke the silence, saying briefly,<lb>
solemnly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, de Lord has spared yer one great sin dis night;<lb>
ole massa 's dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be to God, amen!&rdquo; &ldquo;Halleluyer! dat I'se<lb>
libed ter see dis happy day!&rdquo; &ldquo;De Debble's got him,<lb>
shore!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don't give up de chance, boys; young massa<lb>
and de missis is lef' for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such exclamations of gratitude, joy, and revenge, were<lb>
the only demonstration which the news produced, and,<lb>
mingling with them, a gust of wind came sweeping<lb>
<pb n="375">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-394">

<figdesc>Page 375.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
through the mill, as if nature gave a long sigh of relief<lb>
that another tyrant had ceased to blight and burden her<lb>
fair domain. Sandra's quick ear caught the last words,<lb>
and a deep oath or two, as several men rose with the<lb>
fierce fire rekindling in their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she cried, in a tone that held them even<lb>
against their will, &mdash; &ldquo;yes, young massa's lef'; but not<lb>
to die, for if yer gives up your chance of damnation<lb>
dis night, you'll all be free to-morrer. He's promised<lb>
it; he'll do it, and dere'll be no blood but dat bad man's<lb>
yonder, to cry from de groun', and b'ar witness 'ginst<lb>
yer at de Judgment-Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free! to-morrer! Who's gwine to b'lieve dat,<lb>
Sandra? We's been tole such stories often; but de<lb>
morrer's never come, and now we's gwine to bring<lb>
one for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gigantic man with the spiked collar on his neck<lb>
said that, with a smile of grim determination, as he took<lb>
up the iron bar, which in his desperate hands became a<lb>
terribly formidable weapon.</p>
<p>A low growl, as of muttering thunder, answered him,<lb>
and Sandra's heart sunk within her. But one hope<lb>
remained; and, desperately clinging to it, she found that<lb>
even in these betrayed, benighted creatures there still<lb>
lived a sense of honor, a loyalty to truth, born of the<lb>
manhood God had given them, the gratitude which one<lb>
man had inspired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, jes once more, 'fore yer goes, boys. Tell<lb>
me, what has young massa done ter make yer want his<lb>
blood? Has he ever lashed yer, kicked, and cussed yer?<lb>
Has he sole yer chil'ren, 'bused yer wives, or took yer<lb>
ole folks from yer? Has he done anything but try to<lb>

make ole massa kinder, to do his best fer us while he's<lb>
here; and when he can't do nor b'ar no more, don't he<lb>
go 'way to pray de Lord ter help us fer His sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a voice answered; not one complaint, accusation,<lb>
or reproach was made, and Prince, the fierce leader of<lb>
the insurrection, paused, with his foot upon the threshold<lb>
of the door; for a grateful memory confronted and arrested<lb>
him. One little daughter, the last of many children,<lb>
had been taken from him to be sold, when Gabriel,<lb>
moved by his despair, had bought and freed and given<lb>
her back to him, with the promise that she never should<lb>
be torn from him again. For an instant the clasp of<lb>
little clinging arms seemed to make the sore chafing of<lb>
the iron ring unfelt; the touch of the hand that gave<lb>
the precions gift now made that rude weapon weigh<lb>
heavily in his own, and from the darkness which lay<lb>
between him and the doomed home there seemed to rise<lb>
the shadow of the face which once had looked compassionately<lb>
into his and recognized him as a man. He<lb>
turned, and, standing with his magnificent yet mournful<lb>
figure fully revealed by the red flicker of the torches,<lb>
put out one hand as if to withhold the desperate crowd<lb>
before him, and asked, with an air of authority which<lb>
well became a prince by birth as well as name, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandra, who tole you massa meant ter free us right<lb>
away? You has blessed dreams sometimes, and maybe<lb>
dis is one ob 'em. It's too good to be de troof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is de troof, de livin' troof, and no dream ob mine<lb>
was eber half so blessed as dis yere will be, if we has<lb>
faith. Milly tole me jes now dat Massa Gabriel swore<lb>
before de Lord and his dead father dat he'd free us all<lb>
ter-morrer; and I come here ter save yer from de sin dat<lb>
<pb n="377">

won't help, but hinder yer awful in dis world and de<lb>
next. Dere's more good news 'sides dat. I heerd 'em<lb>
talkin' 'bout de Norf. It's risin', boys, it's risin'! &mdash; de<lb>
tings we's heerd is shore, and de day ob jubilee is comin'<lb>
fas'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was well she added that last hope, for its effect was<lb>
wonderful. Men lifted up their heads, hope quenched<lb>
hatred in eyes that grew joyfully expectant, and for a<lb>
moment the black sky seemed to glimmer with the first<lb>
rays of the North star which should lead them up from<lb>
that Dismal Swamp to a goodly land. Sandra felt the<lb>
change, knew that only one more effective touch was<lb>
needed to secure the victory, and, like the pious soul<lb>
she was, turned in her hour of need to the only Friend<lb>
who never had deserted her. Painfully bending her stiff<lb>
knees, she knelt down before them, folded her hard<lb>
hands, lifted her sightless eyes, and cried, in an agony<lb>
of supplication, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Lord, speak to dese yere pore chil'en, fer I'se<lb>
done my bes'! Help 'em, save 'em, don't let 'em spile<lb>
de freedom dat's comin' by a sin like dis to-night, but let'<lb>
em take it sweet and clean from Thy han' in de mornin'.<lb>
Stan' by young massa, hole him up, don't let him 'spoint<lb>
us, fer we'se ben bery patient, Lord; and help us to<lb>
wait one night more, shore dat he'll keep de promise fer<lb>
Thy blessed sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice rang through the place like a voice from<lb>
heaven; and out from the darkness Gabriel came among<lb>
them. To their startled, superstitious eyes he seemed no<lb>
mortal man, but a beautiful, benignant angel, bringing<lb>
tidings of great joy, as he stood there, armed with no<lb>
<pb n="378">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-397">

<figdesc>Page 378.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
weapon but a righteous purpose, gifted with no eloquence<lb>
but the truth, stirred to his heart's core by strong emotion,<lb>
and lifted above himself by the high mood born of that<lb>
memorable hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My people! mine only while I speak; break up your<lb>
league, lay down your arms, dry your tears, and forgive<lb>
as you are forgiven, for this island no longer holds a<lb>
master or a slave; but all are free forever and forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An awful silence fell upon the place, unbroken till old<lb>
Sandra cried, with a glad, triumphant voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chil'en! de Lord had heerd, de Lord hab answered!<lb>
Bless de Lord! O bless de Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as a strong wind bows a field of grain, the<lb>
breath of liberty swept over fifty souls, and down upon<lb>
their knees fell fifty free men, while a great cry went up<lb>
to heaven. Shouts, sobs, prayers and praises; the clash<lb>
of falling arms; the rattle of fetters wrenched away;<lb>
the rush of men gathered to each other's breasts, &mdash; all<lb>
added to the wild abandonment of a happiness too mighty<lb>
for adequate expression, as that wave of gratitude and<lb>
love rolled up and broke at Gabriel's feet. With face<lb>
hidden in his hands he stood; and while his heart sung<lb>
for joy, tears from the deepest fountains of a man's<lb>
repentant spirit fitly baptized the freedmen, who, clinging<lb>
to his garments, kissing his feet and pouring blessings on<lb>
his head, bestowed upon him a far nobler inheritance<lb>
than that which he had lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word, and Sandra's uplifted hand, hushed the<lb>
tumultuous thanksgiving, as if she were in truth the<lb>
magician they believed her. A far-off murmur of many<lb>
voices, the tramp of many feet was heard; all knew<lb>
<pb n="379">
<eaffig volid="eaf442T" entity="f442-398">

<figdesc>Page 379.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
what it portended, yet none trembled, none fled; for a<lb>
mightier power than either force or fear had conquered,<lb>
and the victory was already won.</p>
<p>Through widening rifts in the stormy sky the moon<lb>
broke clear and calm, gliding, like a visible benediction,<lb>
from the young man's bent head to the dusky faces lifted<lb>
toward the promised light; and in that momentary hush,<lb>
solemn and sweet, across the river a distant clock struck<lb>
twelve.</p>

border consists of a dark line forming a rectangle.  This rectangular
area contains an ornate filigree pattern and three heraldic shields, in
a line next to one another, along the bottom of that patterned,
rectangular area.  The top of each shield is tilted to the left.  The
shield on the left has two crowns on the top, an open book in the
center, and one crown on the bottom.  The shield in the center has an
image of an open right hand within a smaller shield in the middle,
surrounded by a chevron above and below it; six birds of the same type
appear on the shield, with three along the top, two between the chevrons
and on either side of the open hand, and one on the bottom.  The shield
on the right has a circular seal, which appears to include the image of
a globe and a motto.  The patterned, rectangular area also encloses a
smaller, centered, blank rectangle which contains the captions of &ldquo;Ex

<p>A considerable portion of this volume was published in successive<lb>
numbers of <hi rend="italics">The Commonwealth,</hi> newspaper, of Boston.<lb>
The sudden popularity the Sketches won from the general<lb>
public, and the praise they received from literary men of<lb>
distinguished ability, are sufficient reasons, &mdash; were any needed,&mdash;<lb>
for their re-publication, thus revised and enlarged, in this<lb>
more convenient and permanent form. As, besides paying<lb>
the Author the usual copyright, the publisher has resolved to<lb>
devote at least five cents for every copy sold to the support of<lb>
orphans made fatherless or homeless by the war, no reproduction<lb>
of any part of the contents now first printed in these<lb>
pages, will be permitted in any journal. Should the sale of the<lb>
little book be large, the orphans' percentage will be doubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">I want</hi> something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark being addressed to the world in general, no<lb>
one in particular felt it their duty to reply; so I repeated it<lb>
to the smaller world about me, received the following suggestions,<lb>
and settled the matter by answering my own inquiry, as<lb>
people are apt to do when very much in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write a book,&rdquo; quoth the author of my being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't know enough, sir. First live, then write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try teaching again,&rdquo; suggested my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you, ma'am, ten years of that is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a husband like my Darby, and fulfill your mission,&rdquo;<lb>
said sister Joan, home on a visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't afford expensive luxuries, Mrs. Coobiddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn actress, and immortalize your name,&rdquo; said sister<lb>
Vashti, striking an attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go nurse the soldiers,&rdquo; said my young brother, Tom, panting<lb>
for &ldquo;the tented field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far, very good. Here was the will&mdash;now for the way.<lb>
At first sight not a foot of it appeared, but that didn't matter,<lb>
for the Periwinkles are a hopeful race; their crest is an<lb>
anchor, with three cock-a-doodles crowing atop. They all<lb>
wear rose-colored spectacles, and are lineal descendants of the<lb>
inventor of aerial architecture. An hour's conversation on<lb>
the subject set the whole family in a blaze of enthusiasm. A<lb>
model hospital was erected, and each member had accepted an<lb>
honorable post therein. The paternal P. was chaplain, the<lb>
maternal P. was matron, and all the youthful P.s filled the<lb>
pod of futurity with achievements whose brilliancy eclipsed<lb>
the glories of the present and the past. Arriving at this satisfactory<lb>
conclusion, the meeting adjourned, and the fact that<lb>
Miss Tribulation was available as army nurse went abroad on<lb>
the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>In a few days a townswoman heard of my desire, approved<lb>
of it, and brought about an interview with one of the sisterhood<lb>
which I wished to join, who was at home on a furlough,<lb>
and able and willing to satisfy all inquiries. A morning chat<lb>
with Miss General S.&mdash;we hear no end of Mrs. Generals, why<lb>
not a Miss?&mdash;produced three results: I felt that I could do<lb>
the work, was offered a place, and accepted it, promising not<lb>
to desert, but stand ready to march on Washington at an<lb>
hour's notice.</p>
<p>A few days were necessary for the letter containing my re<lb>
quest and recommendation to reach headquarters, and another,<lb>
containing my commission, to return; therefore no time was<lb>
to be lost; and heartily thanking my pair of friends, I tore<lb>
home through the December slush as if the rebels were after<lb>
me, and like many another recruit, burst in upon my family<lb>
with the announcement&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've enlisted!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="011">

</p>
<p>An impressive silence followed. Tom, the irrepressible,<lb>
broke it with a slap on the shoulder and the graceful compliment&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Trib, you're a trump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; then I'll <hi rend="italics">take</hi> something:&rdquo; which I did, in<lb>
the shape of dinner, reeling off my news at the rate of three<lb>
dozen words to a mouthful; and as every one else talked<lb>
equally fast, and all together, the scene was most inspiring.</p>
<p>As boys going to sea immediately become nautical in speech,<lb>
walk as if they already had their &ldquo;sea legs&rdquo; on, and shiver<lb>
their timbers on all possible occasions, so I turned military at<lb>
once, called my dinner my rations, saluted all new comers,<lb>
and ordered a dress parade that very afternoon. Having reviewed<lb>
every rag I possessed, I detailed some for picket duty<lb>
while airing over the fence; some to the sanitary influences of<lb>
the wash-tub; others to mount guard in the trunk; while the<lb>
weak and wounded went to the Work-basket Hospital, to be<lb>
made ready for active service again. To this squad I devoted<lb>
myself for a week; but all was done, and I had time to get<lb>
powerfully impatient before the letter came. It did arrive<lb>
however, and brought a disappointment along with its good<lb>
will and friendliness, for it told me that the place in the Armory<lb>
Hospital that I supposed I was to take, was already<lb>
filled, and a much less desirable one at Hurly-burly House<lb>
was offered instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's just your luck, Trib. I'll tote your trunk up<lb>
garret for you again; for of course you won't go,&rdquo; Tom remarked,<lb>
with the disdainful pity which small boys affect when<lb>
they get into their teens. I was wavering in my secret soul,<lb>
but that settled the matter, and I crushed him on the spot<lb>
with martial brevity&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now one; I shall march at six.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="012">

</p>
<p>I have a confused recollection of spending the afternoon in<lb>
pervading the house like an executive whirlwind, with my<lb>
family swarming after me, all working, talking, prophesying<lb>
and lamenting, while I packed my &ldquo;go-abroady&rdquo; possessions,<lb>
tumbled the rest into two big boxes, danced on the lids till<lb>
they shut, and gave them in charge, with the direction,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I never come back, make a bonfire of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I choked down a cup of tea, generously salted instead<lb>
of sugared, by some agitated relative, shouldered my knapsack&mdash;<lb>
it was only a traveling bag, but do let me preserve the<lb>
unities&mdash;hugged my family three times all round without a<lb>
vestige of unmanly emotion, till a certain dear old lady broke<lb>
down upon my neck, with a despairing sort of wail&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, my dear, how can I let you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll stay if you say so, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don't; go, and the Lord will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the Roman matron's courage had gone into the<lb>
Yankee matron's composition, and, in spite of her tears, she<lb>
would have sent ten sons to the war, had she possessed them,<lb>
as freely as she sent one daughter, smiling and flapping on the<lb>
door-step till I vanished, though the eyes that followed me<lb>
were very dim, and the handkerchief she waved was very<lb>
wet.</p>
<p>My transit from The Gables to the village depot was a funny<lb>
mixture of good wishes and good byes, mud-puddles and shopping.<lb>
A December twilight is not the most cheering time to<lb>
enter upon a somewhat perilous enterprise, and, but for the<lb>
presence of Vashti and neighbor Thorn, I fear that I might<lb>
have added a drop of the briny to the native moisture of&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The town I left behind me;&rdquo;</p>
<p>though I'd no thought of giving out: oh, bless you, no!<lb>
When the engine screeched &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; I clutched my<lb>
<pb n="013">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-018">

<figdesc>Page 013.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
escort in a fervent embrace, and skipped into the car with as<lb>
blithe a farewell as if going on a bridal tour&mdash;though I believe<lb>
brides don't usually wear cavernous black bonnets and<lb>
fuzzy brown coats, with a hair-brush, a pair of rubbers, two<lb>
books, and a bag of ginger-bread distorting the pockets of the<lb>
same. If I thought that any one would believe it, I'd boldly<lb>
state that I slept from C. to B., which would simplify matters<lb>
immensely; but as I know they wouldn't, I'll confess that<lb>
the head under the funereal coal-hod fermented with all manner<lb>
of high thoughts and heroic purposes &ldquo;to do or die,&rdquo;&mdash;<lb>
perhaps both; and the heart under the fuzzy brown coat felt<lb>
very tender with the memory of the dear old lady, probably<lb>
sobbing over her army socks and the loss of her topsy-turvy<lb>
Trib. At this juncture I took the veil, and what I did behind<lb>
it is nobody's business; but I maintain that the soldier<lb>
who cries when his mother says &ldquo;Good bye,&rdquo; is the boy to<lb>
fight best, and die bravest, when the time comes, or go back<lb>
to her better than he went.</p>
<p>Till nine o'clock I trotted about the city streets, doing those<lb>
last errands which no woman would even go to heaven without<lb>
attempting, if she could. Then I went to my usual refuge,<lb>
and, fully intending to keep awake, as a sort of vigil<lb>
appropriate to the occasion, fell fast asleep and dreamed propitious<lb>
dreams till my rosy-faced cousin waked me with a kiss.</p>
<p>A bright day smiled upon my enterprise, and at ten I reported<lb>
myself to my General, received last instructions and<lb>
no end of the sympathetic encouragement which women give,<lb>
in look, touch, and tone more effectually than in words. The<lb>
next step was to get a free pass to Washington, for I'd no<lb>
desire to waste my substance on railroad companies when<lb>
&ldquo;the boys&rdquo; needed even a spinster's mite. A friend of mine<lb>
had procured such a pass, and I was bent on doing likewise,<lb>
<pb n="014">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-019">

<figdesc>Page 014.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
though I had to face the president of the railroad to accomplish<lb>
it. I'm a bashful individual, though I can't get any one to<lb>
believe it; so it cost me a great effort to poke about the<lb>
Worcester depot till the right door appeared, then walk into a<lb>
room containing several gentlemen, and blunder out my request<lb>
in a high state of stammer and blush. Nothing could<lb>
have been more courteous than this dreaded President, but it<lb>
was evident that I had made as absurd a demand as if I had<lb>
asked for the nose off his respectable face. He referred me<lb>
to the Governor at the State House, and I backed out, leaving<lb>
him no doubt to regret that such mild maniacs were left at<lb>
large. Here was a Scylla and Charybdis business: as if a<lb>
President wasn't trying enough, without the Governor of Massachusetts<lb>
and the hub of the hub piled on top of that. &ldquo;I<lb>
never can do it,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;Tom will hoot at you if you<lb>
don't,&rdquo; whispered the inconvenient little voice that is always<lb>
goading people to the performance of disagreeable duties, and<lb>
always appeals to the most effective agent to produce the proper<lb>
result. The idea of allowing any boy that ever wore a<lb>
felt basin and a shoddy jacket with a microscopic tail, to crow<lb>
over me, was preposterous, so giving myself a mental slap for<lb>
such faint-heartedness, I streamed away across the Common,<lb>
wondering if I ought to say &ldquo;your Honor,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;<lb>
and decided upon the latter, fortifying myself with recollections<lb>
of an evening in a charming green library, where I beheld<lb>
the Governor placidly consuming oysters, and laughing<lb>
as if Massachusetts was a myth, and he had no heavier burden<lb>
on his shoulders than his host's handsome hands.</p>
<p>Like an energetic fly in a very large cobweb, I struggled<lb>
through the state House, getting into all the wrong rooms and<lb>
none of the right, till I turned desperate, and went into one,<lb>
resolving not to come out till I'd made somebody hear and<lb>
<pb n="015">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-020">

<figdesc>Page 015.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
answer me. I suspect that of all the wrong places I had<lb>
blundered into, this was the most so. But I didn't care; and,<lb>
though the apartment was full of soldiers, surgeons, starers,<lb>
and spittoons, I cornered a perfectly incapable person, and<lb>
proceeded to pump for information with the following result:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the Governor anywhere about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he wasn't.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he tell me where to look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he couldn't.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know anything about free passes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he didn't.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any one there of whom I could inquire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know of any place where information could be<lb>
obtained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he throw the smallest gleam of light upon the matter,<lb>
in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a ray.</p>
<p>I am naturally irascible, and if I could have shaken this<lb>
negative gentleman vigorously, the relief would have been<lb>
immense. The prejudices of society forbidding this mode of<lb>
redress, I merely glowered at him; and, before my wrath<lb>
found vent in words, my General appeared, having seen me<lb>
from an opposite window, and come to know what I was about.<lb>
At her command the languid gentleman woke up, and troubled<lb>
himself to remember that Major or Sergeant or something<lb>
Mc K. knew all about the tickets, and his office was in Milk<lb>
Street. I perked up instanter, and then, as if the exertion<lb>
was too much for him, what did this animated wet blanket do<lb>
but add&mdash;</p>
<pb n="016">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-021">

<figdesc>Page 016.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mc K. may have left Milk Street, now, and I<lb>
don't know where he has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; the new comers will know where he has<lb>
moved to, my dear, so don't be discouraged; and if you don't<lb>
succeed, come to me, and we will see what to do next,&rdquo; said<lb>
my General.</p>
<p>I blessed her in a fervent manner and a cool hall, fluttered<lb>
round the corner, and bore down upon Milk street, bent on<lb>
discovering Mc K. if such a being was to be found. He<lb>
wasn't, and the ignorance of the neighborhood was really pitiable.<lb>
Nobody knew anything, and after tumbling over bundles<lb>
of leather, bumping against big boxes, being nearly annihilated<lb>
by descending bales, and sworn at by aggravated<lb>
truckmen, I finally elicited the advice to look for Mc K. in<lb>
Haymarket Square. Who my informant was I've really forgotten;<lb>
for, having hailed several busy gentlemen, some one of<lb>
them fabricated this delusive quietus for the perturbed spirit,<lb>
who instantly departed to the sequestered locality he named.<lb>
If I had been in search of the Koh-i-noor diamond I should<lb>
have been as likely to find it there as any vestige of Mc K.<lb>
I stared at signs, inquired in shops, invaded an eating house,<lb>
visited the recruiting tent in the middle of the Square, made<lb>
myself a nuisance generally, and accumulated mud enough to<lb>
retard another Nile. All in vain: and I mournfully turned<lb>
my face toward the General's, feeling that I should be<lb>
forced to enrich the railroad company after all; when, suddenly,<lb>
I beheld that admirable young man, brother-in-law Darby<lb>
Coobiddy, Esq. I arrested him with a burst of news, and<lb>
wants, and woes, which caused his manly countenance to lose<lb>
its usual repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear boy, I'm going to Washington at five, and<lb>
I can't find the free ticket man, and there won't be time to see<lb>
<pb n="017">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-022">

<figdesc>Page 017.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Joan, and I'm so tired and cross I don't know what to do;<lb>
and will you help me, like a cherub as you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. I know a fellow who will set us<lb>
right,&rdquo; responded Darby, mildly excited, and darting into<lb>
some kind of an office, held counsel with an invisible angel,<lb>
who sent him out radiant. &ldquo;All serene. I've got him. I'll<lb>
see you through the business, and then get Joan from the<lb>
Dove Cote in time to see you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I'm a woman's rights woman, and if any man had offered<lb>
help in the morning, I should have condescendingly refused<lb>
it, sure that I could do everything as well, if not better, myself.<lb>
My strong-mindedness had rather abated since then,<lb>
and I was now quite ready to be a &ldquo;timid trembler,&rdquo; if necessary.<lb>
Dear me! how easily Darby did it all: he just asked<lb>
one question, received an answer, tucked me under his arm,<lb>
and in ten minutes I stood in the presence of Mc K., the<lb>
Desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my troubles are over,&rdquo; thought I, and as usual was<lb>
direfully mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to get a pass from Dr. H., in Temple<lb>
Place, before I can give you a pass, madam,&rdquo; answered Mc<lb>
K., as blandly as if he wasn't carrying desolation to my soul.<lb>
Oh, indeed! why didn't he send me to Dorchester Heights,<lb>
India Wharf, or Bunker Hill Monument, and done with it?<lb>
Here I was, after a morning's tramp, down in some place about<lb>
Dock Square, and was told to step to Temple Place. Nor<lb>
was that all; he might as well have asked me to catch a humming-bird,<lb>
toast a salamander, or call on the man in the moon,<lb>
as find a Doctor at home at the busiest hour of the day. It<lb>
was a blow; but weariness had extinguished enthusiasm, and<lb>
resignation clothed me as a garment. I sent Darby for Joan,<lb>
and doggedly paddled off, feeling that mud was my native<lb>
<pb n="018">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-023">

<figdesc>Page 018.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
element, and quite sure that the evening papers would announce<lb>
the appearance of the Wandering Jew, in feminine habiliments.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. H. in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mum, he aint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he wasn't; I knew that before I asked: and,<lb>
considering it all in the light of a hollow mockery, added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will be probably return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the damsel had said, &ldquo;ten to-night,&rdquo; I should have felt a<lb>
grim satisfaction, in the fulfillment of my own dark prophecy;<lb>
but she said, &ldquo;At two, mum;&rdquo; and I felt it a personal insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll call, then. Tell him my business is important:&rdquo; with<lb>
which mysteriously delivered message I departed, hoping that<lb>
I left her consumed with curiosity; for mud rendered me an<lb>
object of interest.</p>
<p>By way of resting myself, I crossed the Common, for the<lb>
third time, bespoke the carriage, got some lunch, packed my<lb>
purchases, smoothed my plumage, and was back again, as the<lb>
clock struck two. The Doctor hadn't come yet; and I was<lb>
morally certain that he would not, till, having waited till the<lb>
last minute, I was driven to buy a ticket, and, five minutes<lb>
after the irrevocable deed was done, he would be at my service,<lb>
with all manner of helpful documents and directions.<lb>
Everything goes by contraries with me; so, having made up<lb>
my mind to be disappointed, of course I wasn't; for, presently,<lb>
in walked Dr. H., and no sooner had he heard my errand,<lb>
and glanced at my credentials, than he said, with the most engaging<lb>
readiness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you the order, with pleasure, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words connot express how soothing and delightful it was to<lb>
find, at last, somebody who could do what I wanted, without<lb>
sending me from Dan to Beersheba, for a dozen other bodies<lb>
<pb n="019">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-024">

<figdesc>Page 019.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to do something else first. Peace descended, like oil, upon<lb>
the ruffled waters of my being, as I sat listening to the busy<lb>
scratch of his pen; and, when he turned about, giving me not<lb>
only the order, but a paper of directions wherewith to smooth<lb>
away all difficulties between Boston and Washington, I felt as<lb>
did poor Christian when the Evangelist gave him the scroll,<lb>
on the safe side of the Slough of Despond. I've no doubt<lb>
many dismal nurses have inflicted themselves upon the worthy<lb>
gentleman since then; but I am sure none have been more<lb>
kindly helped, or are more grateful, than T. P.; for that short<lb>
interview added another to the many pleasant associations that<lb>
already surround his name.</p>
<p>Feeling myself no longer a &ldquo;Martha Struggles,&rdquo; but a<lb>
comfortable young woman, with plain sailing before her, and<lb>
the worst of the voyage well over, I once more presented myself<lb>
to the valuable Mc K. The order was read, and certain<lb>
printed papers, necessary to be filled out, were given a young<lb>
gentleman&mdash;no, I prefer to say Boy, with a scornful emphasis<lb>
upon the word, as the only means of revenge now left me.<lb>
This Boy, instead of doing his duty with the diligence so<lb>
charming in the young loitered and lounged, in a manner<lb>
which proved his education to have been sadly neglected in<lb>
the&mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;How doth the little busy bee,&rdquo;</p></q>
direction. He started at me, gaped out of the window, ate<lb>
peanuts, and gossiped with his neighbors&mdash;Boys, like himself,<lb>
and all penned in a row, like colts at a Cattle Show. I don't<lb>
imagine he knew the anguish he was inflicting; for it was<lb>
nearly three, the train left at five, and I had my ticket to get,<lb>
my dinner to eat, my blessed sister to see, and the depot to<lb>
reach, if I didn't die of apoplexy. Meanwhile, Patience<lb>
certainly had her perfect work that day, and I hope she<lb>
<pb n="020">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-025">

<figdesc>Page 020.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enjoyed the job more than I did. Having waited some twenty<lb>
minutes, it pleased this reprehensible Boy to make various<lb>
marks and blots on my documents, toss them to a venerable<lb>
creature of sixteen, who delivered them to me with such paternal<lb>
directions, that it only needed a pat on the head and an<lb>
encouraging&mdash;&ldquo;Now run home to your Ma, little girl, and<lb>
mind the crossings, my dear,&rdquo; to make the illusion quite perfect.<lb>
</p>
<p>Why I was sent to a steamboat office for car tickets, is not<lb>
for me to say, though I went as meekly as I should have gone<lb>
to the Probate Court, if sent. A fat, easy gentleman gave<lb>
me several bits of paper, with coupons attached, with a warning<lb>
not to separate them, which instantly inspired me with a<lb>
yearning to pluck them apart, and see what came of it. But,<lb>
remembering through what fear and tribulation I had obtained<lb>
them, I curbed Satan's promptings, and, clutching my prize, as<lb>
if it were my pass to the Elysian Fields, I hurried home.<lb>
Dinner was rapidly consumed; Joan enlightened, comforted,<lb>
and kissed; the dearest of apple-faced cousins hugged; the<lb>
kindest of apple-faced cousins' fathers subjected to the same<lb>
process; and I mounted the ambulance, baggage-wagon, or<lb>
anything you please but hack, and drove away, too tired to<lb>
feel excited, sorry, or glad.</p>

the boat at New London. Very comfortable; munch ginger-bread,<lb>
and Mrs. C.'s fine pear, which deserves honorable mention,<lb>
because my first loneliness was comforted by it, and pleasant<lb>
recollections of both kindly sender and bearer. Look<lb>
much at Dr. H.'s paper of directions&mdash;put my tickets in every<lb>
conceivable plae, that they may be get-at-able, and finish<lb>
by losing them entirely. Suffer agonies till a compassionate<lb>
neighbor pokes them out of a crack with his pen-knife. Put<lb>
them in the inmost corner of my purse, that in the deepest<lb>
recesses of my pocket, pile a collection of miscellaneous articles<lb>

atop, and pin up the whole. Just get composed, feeling<lb>
that I've done my best to keep them safely, when the Conductor<lb>
appears, and I'm forced to rout them all out again, exposing<lb>
my precautions, and getting into a flutter at keeping<lb>
the man waiting. Finally, fasten them on the seat before me,<lb>
and keep one eye steadily upon the yellow torments, till I forget<lb>
all about them, in chat with the gentleman who shares my<lb>
seat. Having heard complaints of the absurd way in which<lb>
American women become images of petrified propriety, if addressed<lb>
by strangers, when traveling alone, the inborn perversity<lb>
of my nature causes me to assume an entirely opposite<lb>
style of deportment; and, finding my companion hails<lb>
from Little Athens, is acquainted with several of my three<lb>
hundred and sixty-five cousins, and in every way a respectable<lb>
and respectful member of society, I put my bashfulness in<lb>
my pocket, and plunge into a long conversation on the war,<lb>
the weather, music, Carlyle, skating, genius, hoops, and the<lb>
immortality of the soul.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Ten, P. M.</hi>&mdash;Very sleepy. Nothing to be seen outside,<lb>
but darkness made visible; nothing inside but every variety<lb>
of bunch into which the human form can be twisted, rolled,<lb>
or &ldquo;massed,&rdquo; as Miss Prescott says of her jewels. Every<lb>
man's legs sprawl drowsily, every woman's head (but mine,)<lb>
nods, till it finally settles on somebody's shoulder, a new proof<lb>
of the truth of the overlasting oak and vine simile; children<lb>
fret; lovers whisper; old folks snore, and somebody privately<lb>
imbibes brandy, when the lamps go out. The penetrating<lb>
perfume rouses the multitude, causing some to start up, like<lb>
war horses at the smell of powder. When the lamps are relighted,<lb>
every one laughs, sniffs, and looks inquiringly at his<lb>
neighbor&mdash;every one but a stout gentleman, who, with wellgloved<lb>
hands folded upon his broad-cloth rotunuity, sleeps on<lb>

impressively. Had he been innocent, he would have waked<lb>
up; for, to slumber in that babe-like manner, with a car full<lb>
of giggling, staring, sniffing humanity, was simply preposterous.<lb>
Public suspicion was down upon him at once. I doubt<lb>
if the appearance of a flat black bottle with a label would<lb>
have settled the matter more effectually than did the over dignified<lb>
and profound repose of this short-sighted being. His<lb>
moral neck-cloth, virtuous boots, and pious attitude availed<lb>
him nothing, and it was well he kept his eyes shut, for<lb>
&ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; twinkled at him from every window-pane, brass<lb>
nail and human eye around him.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Eleven, P. M.</hi>&mdash;In the boat &ldquo;City of Boston,&rdquo; escorted<lb>
thither by my car acquaintance, and deposited in the cabin.<lb>
Trying to look as if the greater portion of my life had been<lb>
passed on board boats, but painfully conscious that I don't<lb>
know the first thing; so sit bolt upright, and stare about me<lb>
till I hear one lady say to another&mdash;&ldquo;We must secure our<lb>
berths at once;&rdquo; whereupon I dart at one, and, while leisurely<lb>
taking off my cloak, wait to discover what the second move<lb>
may be. Several ladies draw the curtains that hang in a<lb>
semi-circle before each nest&mdash;instantly I whisk mine smartly<lb>
together, and then peep out to see what next. Gradually, on<lb>
hooks above the blue and yellow drapery, appear the coats<lb>
and bonnets of my neighbors, while their boots and shoes, in<lb>
every imaginable attitude, assert themselves below, as if their<lb>
owners had committed suicide in a body. A violent creaking,<lb>
scrambling, and fussing, causes the fact that people are<lb>
going regularly to bed to dawn upon my mind. Of course<lb>
they are! and so am I&mdash;but pause at the seventh pin, remembering<lb>
that, as I was born to be drowned, an eligible opportunity<lb>
now presents itself; and, having twice escaped a watery<lb>
grave, the third immersion will certainly extinguish my vital<lb>

spark. The boat is new, but if it ever intends to blow up,<lb>
spring a leak, catch afire, or be run into, it will do the deed<lb>
tonight, because I'm here to fulfill my destiny. With tragic<lb>
calmness I resign myself, replace my pins, lash my purse and<lb>
papers together, with my handkerchief, examine the saving<lb>
circumference of my hoop, and look about me for any means<lb>
of deliverance when the moist moment shall arrive; for I've<lb>
no intention of folding my hands and bubbling to death without<lb>
an energetic splashing first. Barrels, hen-coops, portable<lb>
settees, and life-preservers do not adorn the cabin, as they<lb>
should; and, roving wildly to and fro, my eye sees no ray of<lb>
hope till it falls upon a plump old lady, devoutly reading in<lb>
the cabin Bible, and a voluminous night-cap. I remember<lb>
that, at the swimming school, fat girls always floated best, and<lb>
in an instant my plan is laid. At the first alarm I firmly<lb>
attach myself to the plump lady, and cling to her through<lb>
fire and water; for I feel that my old enemy, the cramp, will<lb>
seize me by the foot, if I attempt to swim; and, though I can<lb>
hardly expect to reach Jersey City with myself and my baggage<lb>
in as good condition as I hoped, I might manage to get<lb>
picked up by holding to my fat friend; if not it will be a<lb>
comfort to feel that I've made an effort and shall die in good<lb>
society. Poor dear woman! how little she dreamed, as she<lb>
read and rocked, with her cap in a high state of starch, and her<lb>
feet comfortably cooking at the register, what fell designs<lb>
were hovering about her, and how intently a small but determined<lb>
eye watched her, till it suddenly closed.</p>
<p>Sleep got the better of fear to such an extent that my boots<lb>
appeared to gape, and my bonnet nodded on its peg, before I<lb>
gave in. Having piled my cloak, bag, rubbers, books and<lb>
umbrella on the lower shelf, I drowsily swarmed onto the<lb>
upper one, tumbling down a few times, and excoriating the<lb>

<milestn unit="collation" n="C">
knobby portions of my frame in the act. A very brief nap<lb>
on the upper roost was enough to set me gasping as if a dozen<lb>
feather beds and the whole boat were laid over me. Out I<lb>
turned; and, after a series of convulsions, which caused my<lb>
neighbor to ask if I wanted the stewardess, I managed to get<lb>
my luggage up and myself down. But even in the lower<lb>
berth, my rest was not unbroken, for various articles kept<lb>
dropping off the little shelf at the bottom of the bed, and every<lb>
time I flew up, thinking my hour had come, I bumped<lb>
my head severely against the little shelf at the top, evidently<lb>
put there for that express purpose. At last, after listening to<lb>
the swash of the waves outside, wondering if the machinery<lb>
usually creaked in that way, and watching a knot-hole in the<lb>
side of my berth, sure that death would creep in there as<lb>
soon as I took my eye from it, I dropped asleep, and dreamed<lb>
of muffins.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Five, A. M.</hi>&mdash;On deck, trying to wake up and enjoy an<lb>
east wind and a morning fog, and a twilight sort of view of<lb>
something on the shore. Rapidly achieve my purpose, and<lb>
do enjoy every moment, as we go rushing through the Sound,<lb>
with steamboats passing up and down, lights dancing on the<lb>
shore, mist wreaths slowly furling off, and a pale pink sky<lb>
above us, as the sun comes up.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Seven, A. M.</hi>&mdash;In the cars, at Jersey City. Much fuss<lb>
with tickets, which one man scribbles over, another snips, and<lb>
a third &ldquo;makes note on.&rdquo; Partake of refreshment, in the<lb>
gloom of a very large and dirty depot. Think that my sandwiches<lb>
would be more relishing without so strong a flavor of<lb>
napkin, and my gingerbread more easy of consumption if it<lb>
had not been pulverized by being sat upon. People act as if<lb>
early travelling didn't agree with them. Children scream and<lb>
scamper; men smoke and growl; women shiver and fret;<lb>

porswear; great truck horses pace up and down with loads of<lb>
baggage; and every one seems to get into the wrong car, and<lb>
come tumbling out again. One man, with three children, a<lb>
dog, a bird-cage, and several bundles, puts himself and his<lb>
possessions into every possible place where a man, three children,<lb>
dog, bird-cage and bundles could be got, and is satisfied<lb>
with none of them. I follow their movements, with an interest<lb>
that is really exhausting, and, as they vanish, hope for<lb>
rest, but don't get it. A strong-minded woman, with a tumbler<lb>
in her hand, and no cloak or shawl on, comes rushing<lb>
through the car, talking loudly to a small porter, who lugs a<lb>
folding bed after her, and looks as if life were a burden to<lb>
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised to have it ready. It is not ready. It must<lb>
be a car with a water jar, the windows must be shut, the fire<lb>
must be kept up, the blinds must be down. No, this won't<lb>
do. I shall go through the whole train, and suit myself, for<lb>
you promised to have it ready. It is not ready,&rdquo; &amp;c., all<lb>
through again, like a hand-organ. She haunted the cars, the<lb>
depot, the office and baggage-room, with her bed, her tumbler,<lb>
and her tongue, till the train started; and a sense of fervent<lb>
gratitude filled my soul, when I found that she and her unknown<lb>
invalid were not to share our car.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Philadelphia.</hi>&mdash;An old place, full of Dutch women, in<lb>
&ldquo;bellus top&rdquo; bonnets, selling vegetables, in long, open markets.<lb>
Every one seems to be scrubbing their white steps.<lb>
All the houses look like tidy jails, with their outside shutters.<lb>
Several have crape on the door-handles, and many have flags<lb>
flying from roof or balcony. Few men appear, and the<lb>
women seem to do the business, which, perhaps, accounts for<lb>
its being so well done. Pass fine buildings, but don't know<lb>
what they are. Would like to stop and see my native city;<lb>
<pb n="027">

</eaffig>
for, having left it at the tender age of two, my recollections<lb>
are not vivid.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Baltimore.</hi>&mdash;A big, dirty, shippy, shiftless place, full of<lb>
goats, geese, colored people, and coal, at least the part of it I<lb>
see. Pass near the spot where the riot took place, and feel as<lb>
if I should enjoy throwing a stone at somebody, hard. Find<lb>
a guard at the ferry, the depot, and here and there, along the<lb>
road. A camp whitens one hill-side, and a cavalry training<lb>
school, or whatever it should be called, is a very interesting<lb>
sight, with quantities of horses and riders galloping, marching,<lb>
leaping, and skirmishing, over all manner of break-neck<lb>
places. A party of English people get in&mdash;the men, with<lb>
sandy hair and red whiskers, all trimmed alike, to a hair;<lb>
rough grey coats, very rosy, clean faces, and a fine, full way<lb>
of speaking, which is particularly agreeable, after our slipshod<lb>
American gabble. The two ladies wear funny velvet<lb>
fur-trimmed hoods; are done up, like compact bundles, in tar<lb>
tan shawls; and look as if bent on seeing everything thoroughly.<lb>
The devotion of one elderly John Bull to his red-nosed<lb>
spouse was really beautiful to behold. She was plain and<lb>
cross, and fussy and stupid, but J. B., Esq., read no papers<lb>
when she was awake, turned no cold shoulder when she wished<lb>
to sleep, and cheerfully said, &ldquo;Yes, me dear,&rdquo; to every wish<lb>
or want the wife of his bosom expressed. I quite warmed to<lb>
the excellent man, and asked a question or two, as the only<lb>
means of expressing my good will. He answered very civilly,<lb>
but evidently hadn't been used to being addressed by<lb>
strange women in public conveyances; and Mrs. B. fixed her<lb>
green eyes upon me, as if she thought me a forward huzzy, or<lb>
whatever is good English for a presuming young women. The<lb>
pair left their friends before we reached Washington; and the<lb>
last I saw of them was a vision of a large plaid lady, stalking<lb>
<pb n="028">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-033">

<figdesc>Page 028.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
grimly away, on the arm of a rosy, stout gentleman, loaded<lb>
with rugs, bags, and books, but still devoted, still smiling, and<lb>
waving a hearty &ldquo;Fare ye well! We'll meet ye at Willard's<lb>
on Chusday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after their departure we had an accident; for no long<lb>
journey in America would be complete without one. A coupling<lb>
iron broke; and, after leaving the last car behind us, we<lb>
waited for it to come up, which it did, with a crash that<lb>
knocked every one forward on their faces, and caused several<lb>
old ladies to screech dismally. Hats flew off, bonnets were<lb>
flattened, the stove skipped, the lamps fell down, the water<lb>
jar turned a somersault, and the wheel just over which I sat<lb>
received some damage. Of course, it became necessary for<lb>
all the men to get out, and stand about in everybody's way,<lb>
while repairs were made; and for the women to wrestle their<lb>
heads out of the windows, asking ninety-nine foolish questions<lb>
to one sensible one. A few wise females seized this favorable<lb>
moment to better their seats, well knowing that few men can<lb>
face the wooden stare with which they regard the former possessors<lb>
of the places they have invaded.</p>
<p>The country through which we passed did not seem so very<lb>
unlike that which I had left, except that it was more level and<lb>
less wintry. In summer time the wide fields would have<lb>
shown me new sights, and the way-side hedges blossomed with<lb>
new flowers; now, everything was sere and sodden, and a general<lb>
air of shiftlessness prevailed, which would have caused a<lb>
New England farmer much disgust, and a strong desire to<lb>
&ldquo;buckle to,&rdquo; and &ldquo;right up&rdquo; things. Dreary little houses,<lb>
with chimneys built outside, with clay and rough sticks piled<lb>
crosswise, as we used to build cob towers, stood in barren<lb>
looking fields, with cow, pig, or mule lounging about the door.<lb>
We often passed colored people, looking as if they had come<lb>
<pb n="029">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-034">

<figdesc>Page 029.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
out of a picture book, or off the stage, but not at all the sort<lb>
of people I'd been accustomed to see at the North.</p>
<p>Way-side encampments made the fields and lanes gay with<lb>
blue coats and the glitter of buttons. Military washes flapped<lb>
and fluttered on the fences; pots were steaming in the open<lb>
air; all sorts of tableaux seen through the openings of tents,<lb>
and everywhere the boys threw up their caps and cut capers as<lb>
we passed.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Washington.</hi>&mdash;It was dark when we arrived; and, but for<lb>
the presence of another friendly gentleman, I should have<lb>
yielded myself a helpless prey to the first overpowering hack-man,<lb>
who insisted that I wanted to go just where I didn't. Putting<lb>
me into the conveyance I belonged in, my escort added<lb>
to the obligation by pointing out the objects of interest which<lb>
we passed in our long drive. Though I'd often been told that<lb>
Washington was a spacious place, its visible magnitude quite<lb>
took my breath away, and of course I quoted Randolph's<lb>
expression, &ldquo;a city of magnificent distances,&rdquo; as I suppose<lb>
every one does when they see it. The Capitol was so like the<lb>
pictures that hang opposite the staring Father of his Country,<lb>
in boarding-houses and hotels, that it did not impress me,<lb>
except to recall the time when I was sure that Cinderella went<lb>
to housekeeping in just such a place, after she had married the<lb>
inflammable Prince; though, even at that early period, I had<lb>
my doubts as to the wisdom of a match whose foundation was<lb>
of glass.</p>
<p>The White House was lighted up, and carriages were rolling<lb>
in and out of the great gate. I stared hard at the famous<lb>
East Room, and would have liked a peep through the crack of<lb>
the door. My old gentleman was indefatigable in his attentions,<lb>
and I said &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; to everything he pointed out,<lb>
though I suspect I often admired the wrong place, and<lb>
<pb n="030">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-035">

</eaffig>
missed the right. Pennsylvania Avenue, with its bustle,<lb>
lights, music, and military, made me feel as if I'd crossed the<lb>
water and landed somewhere in Carnival time. Coming to<lb>
less noticeable parts of the city, my companion fell silent, and<lb>
I meditated upon the perfection which Art had attained in<lb>
America&mdash;having just passed a bronze statue of some hero,<lb>
who looked like a black Methodist minister, in a cocked hat,<lb>
above the waist, and a tipsy squire below; while his horse stood<lb>
like an opera dancer, on one leg, in a high, but somewhat remarkable<lb>
wind, which blew his mane one way and his massive<lb>
tail the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurly-burly House, ma'am!&rdquo; called a voice, startling me<lb>
from my reverie, as we stopped before a great pile of buildings,<lb>
with a flag flying before it, sentinels at the door, and a<lb>
very trying quantity of men lounging about. My heart beat<lb>
rather faster than usual, and it suddenly struck me that I was<lb>
very far from home; but I descended with dignity, wondering<lb>
whether I should be stopped for want of a countersign, and<lb>
forced to pass the night in the street. Marching boldly up the<lb>
steps, I found that no form was necessary, for the men fell<lb>
back, the guard touched their caps, a boy opened the door,<lb>
and, as it closed behind me, I felt that I was fairly started,<lb>
and Nurse Periwinkle's Mission was begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">They've</hi> come! they've come! hurry up, ladies&mdash;you're<lb>
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who have come? the rebels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sudden summons in the gray dawn was somewhat<lb>
startling to a three days' nurse like myself, and, as the thundering<lb>
knock came at our door, I sprang up in my bed, prepared<lb>
<lb>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;To gird my woman's form,</l>
<l>And on the ramparts die,&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
if necessary, but my room-mate took it more coolly, and, as<lb>
she began a rapid toilet, answered my bewildered question,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, no child; it's the wounded from Fredericksburg;<lb>
forty ambulances are at the door, and we shall have<lb>
our hands full in fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we have to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wash, dress, feed, warm and nurse them for the next<lb>
three months, I dare say. Eighty beds are ready, and we<lb>
were getting impatient for the men to come. Now you will<lb>

</eaffig>
begin to see hospital life in earnest, for you won't probably<lb>
find time to sit down all day, and may think yourself fortunate<lb>
if you get to bed by midnight. Come to me in the ball-room<lb>
when you are ready; the worst cases are always carried there,<lb>
and I shall need your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the energetic little woman twirled her hair into a<lb>
button at the back of her head, in a &ldquo;cleared for action&rdquo; sort<lb>
of style, and vanished, wrestling her way into a feminine kind<lb>
of pea-jacket as she went.</p>
<p>I am free to confess that I had a realizing sense of the fact<lb>
that my hospital bed was not a bed of roses just then, or the<lb>
prospect before me one of unmingled rapture. My three<lb>
days' experiences had begun with a death, and, owing to the<lb>
defalcation of another nurse, a somewhat abrupt plunge into<lb>
the superintendence of a ward containing forty beds, where I<lb>
spent my shining hours washing faces, serving rations, giving<lb>
medicine, and sitting in a very hard chair, with pneumonia on<lb>
one side, diptheria on the other, five typhoids on the opposite,<lb>
and a dozen dilapidated patriots, hopping, lying, and lounging<lb>
about, all staring more or less at the new &ldquo;nuss,&rdquo; who suffered<lb>
untold agonies, but concealed them under as matronly an<lb>
aspect as a spinster could assume, and blundered through her<lb>
trying labors with a Spartan firmness, which I hope they appreciated,<lb>
but am afraid they didn't. Having a taste for<lb>
&ldquo;ghastliness,&rdquo; I had rather longed for the wounded to arrive,<lb>
for rheumatism wasn't heroic, neither was liver complaint, or<lb>
measles; even fever had lost its charms since &ldquo;bathing burning<lb>
brows&rdquo; had been used up in romances, real and ideal;<lb>
but when I peeped into the dusky street lined with what I at<lb>
first had innocently called market carts, now unloading their<lb>
sad freight at our door, I recalled sundry reminiscences I had<lb>
heard from nurses of longer standing, my ardor experienced a<lb>
<pb n="033">

<figdesc>Page 033.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sudden chill, and I indulged in a most unpatriotic wish that I<lb>
was safe at home again, with a quiet day before me, and no<lb>
necessity for being hustled up, as if I were a hen and had<lb>
only to hop off my roost, give my plumage a peck, and be<lb>
ready for action. A second bang at the door sent this recreant<lb>
desire to the right about, as a little woolly head popped in,<lb>
and Joey, (a six years' old contraband,) announced&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Blank is jes' wild fer ye, and says fly round right<lb>
away. They's comin' in, I tell yer, lieaps on 'em&mdash;one was<lb>
took out dead, and I see him,&mdash;ky! warn't he a goner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which cheerful intelligence the imp scuttled away,<lb>
singing like a blackbird, and I followed, feeling that Richard<lb>
was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> himself again, and wouldn't be for a long time to<lb>
come.</p>
<p>The first thing I met was a regiment of the vilest odors<lb>
that ever assaulted the human nose, and took it by storm.<lb>
Cologne, with its seven and seventy evil savors, was a posybed<lb>
to it; and the worst of this affliction was, every one had<lb>
assured me that it was a chronic weakness of all hospitals, and<lb>
I must bear it. I did, armed with lavender water, with which<lb>
I so besprinkled myself and premises, that, like my friend,<lb>
Sairy, I was soon known among my patients as &ldquo;the nurse<lb>
with the bottle.&rdquo; Having been run over by three excited<lb>
surgeons, bumped against by migratory coal-hods, water-pails,<lb>
and small boys; nearly sealded by an avalanche of newlyfilled<lb>
tea-pots, and hopelessly entangled in a knot of colored<lb>
sisters coming to wash, I progressed by slow stages up stairs<lb>
and down, till the main hall was reached, and I paused to<lb>
take breath and a survey. There they were! &ldquo;our brave<lb>
boys,&rdquo; as the papers justly call them, for cowards could hardly<lb>
have been so riddled with shot and shell, so torn and shattered,<lb>
nor have borne suffering for which we have no name,<lb>
<pb n="034">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-039">

<figdesc>Page 034.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with an uncomplaining fortitude, which made one glad to<lb>
cherish each as a brother. In they came, some on stretchers,<lb>
some in men's arms, some feebly staggering along propped on<lb>
rude crutches, and one lay stark and still with covered face,<lb>
as a comrade gave his name to be recorded before they carried<lb>
him away to the dead house. All was hurry and confusion;<lb>
the hall was full of these wrecks of humanity, for the most<lb>
exhausted could not reach a bed till duly ticketed and registered;<lb>
the wall were lined with rows of such as could sit,<lb>
the floor covered with the more disabled, the steps and doorways<lb>
filled with helpers and lookers on; the sound of many<lb>
feet and voices made that usually quiet hour as noisy as noon;<lb>
and, in the midst of it all, the matron's motherly face brought<lb>
more comfort to many a poor soul, than the cordial draughts<lb>
she administered, or the cheery words that welcomed all, making<lb>
of the hospital a home.</p>
<p>The sight of several stretchers, each with its legless, armless,<lb>
or desperately wounded occupant, entering my ward,<lb>
admonished me that I was there to work, not to wonder or<lb>
weep; so I corked up my feelings, and returned to the path<lb>
of duty, which was rather &ldquo;a hard road to travel&rdquo; just then.<lb>
The house had been a hotel before hospitals were needed, and<lb>
many of the doors still bore their old names; some not so<lb>
inappropriate as might be imagined, for my ward was in truth<lb>
a <hi rend="italics">ball-room,</hi> if gun-shot wounds could christen it. Forty beds<lb>
were prepared, many already tenanted by tired men who fell<lb>
down anywhere, and drowsed till the smell of food roused<lb>
them. Round the great stove was gathered the dreariest<lb>
group I ever saw&mdash;ragged, gaunt and pale, mud to the knees,<lb>
with bloody bandages untouched since put on days before;<lb>
many bundled up in blankets, coats being lost or useless; and<lb>
all wearing that disheartened look which proclaimed defeat,<lb>
<pb n="035">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-040">

<figdesc>Page 035.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
more plainly than any telegram of the Burnside blunder. I<lb>
pitied them so much, I dared not speak to them, though, remembering<lb>
all they had been through since the route at Fredericksburg,<lb>
I yearned to serve the dreariest of them<lb>
all. Presently, Miss Blank tore me from my refuge behind<lb>
piles of one-sleeved shirts, odd socks, bandages and lint; put<lb>
basin, sponge, towels, and a block of brown soap into my<lb>
hands, with these appalling directions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear, begin to wash as fast as you can. Tell<lb>
them to take off socks, coats and shirts, scrub them well, put<lb>
on clean shirts, and the attendants will finish them off, and<lb>
lay them in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had requested me to shave them all, or dance a<lb>
hornpipe on the stove funnel, I should have been less staggered;<lb>
but to scrub some dozen lords of creation at a moment's<lb>
notice, was really&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;. However, there was<lb>
no time for nonsense. and, having resolved when I came to do<lb>
everything I was bid, I drowned my scruples in my washbowl,<lb>
clutched my soap manfully, and, assuming a business-like<lb>
air, made a dab at the first dirty specimen I saw, bent on<lb>
performing my task <hi rend="italics">vi et armis</hi> if necessary. I chanced to<lb>
light on a withered old Irishman, wounded in the head, which<lb>
caused that portion of his frame to be tastefully laid out like a<lb>
garden, the bandages being the walks, his hair the shrubbery.<lb>
He was so overpowered by the honor of having a lady wash<lb>
him, as he expressed it, that he did nothing but roll up his<lb>
eyes, and bless me, in an irresistible style which was too much<lb>
for my sense of the ludicrous; so we laughed together, and<lb>
when I knelt down to take off his shoes, he &ldquo;flopped&rdquo; also<lb>
and wouldn't hear of my touching &ldquo;them dirty craters. May<lb>
your bed above be aisy darlin', for the day's work ye are doon!&mdash;<lb>
Whoosh! there ye are, and bedad, it's hard tellin' which is<lb>
<pb n="036">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-041">

<figdesc>Page 036.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the dirtiest, the fut or the shoe.&rdquo; It was; and if he hadn't<lb>
been to the fore, I should have gone on pulling, under the<lb>
impression that the &ldquo;fut&rdquo; was a boot, for trousers, socks,<lb>
shoes and legs were a mass of mud. This comical tableau<lb>
produced a general grin, at which propitious beginning I took<lb>
heart and scrubbed away like any tidy parent on a Saturday<lb>
night. Some of them took the performance like sleepy children,<lb>
leaning their tired heads against me as I worked, others<lb>
looked grimly scandalized, and several of the roughest colored<lb>
like bashful girls. One wore a soiled little bag about his<lb>
neck, and, as I moved it, to bathe his wounded breast, I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your talisman didn't save you, did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon it did, marm, for that shot would a gone<lb>
a couple a inches deeper but for my old mammy's camphor<lb>
bag,&rdquo; answered the cheerful philosopher.</p>
<p>Another, with a gun-shot would through the cheek, asked<lb>
for a looking-glass, and when I brought one, regarded his<lb>
swollen face with a dolorous expression, as he muttered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vow to gosh, that's too bad! I warn't a bad looking<lb>
chap before, and now I'm done for; won't there be a thun<lb>
derin' scar? and what on earth will Josephine Skinner say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at me with his one eye so appealingly, that I<lb>
controlled my risibles, and assured him that if Josephine was<lb>
a girl of sense, she would admire the honorable scar, as a<lb>
lasting proof that he had faced the enemy, for all women<lb>
thought a wound the best decoration a brave soldier could<lb>
wear. I hope Miss Skinner verified the good opinion I so<lb>
rashly expressed of her, but I shall never know.</p>
<p>The next scrubbee was a nice looking lad, with a curly<lb>
brown mane, and a budding trace of gingerbread over the lip,<lb>
which he called his beard, and defended stoutly, when the<lb>
barber jocosely suggested its immolation. He lay on a bed,<lb>
<pb n="037">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-042">

<figdesc>Page 037.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with one leg gone, and the right arm so shattered that it must<lb>
evidently follow; yet the little Sergeant was as merry as if his<lb>
afflictions were not worth lamenting over, and when a drop or<lb>
two of salt water mingled with my suds at the sight of this<lb>
strong young body, so marred and mained, the boy looked<lb>
up, with a brave smile, though there was a little quiver of the<lb>
lips, as he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don't you fret yourself about me, miss; I'm first<lb>
rate here, for it's nuts to lie still on this bed, after knocking<lb>
about in those confounded ambulances, that shake what there<lb>
is left of a fellow to jelly. I never was in one of these places<lb>
before, and think this cleaning up a jolly thing for us, though<lb>
I'm afraid it isn't for you ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your first battle, Sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, miss; I've been in six scrimmages, and never got a<lb>
scratch till this last one; but it's done the business pretty<lb>
thoroughly for me, I should say. Lord! what a scramble<lb>
there'll be for arms and legs, when we old boys come out of<lb>
our graves, on the Judgment Day: wonder if we shall get<lb>
our own again? If we do, my leg will have to tramp from<lb>
Fredericksburg, my arm from here, I suppose, and meet my<lb>
body, wherever it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fancy seemed to tickle him mightily, for he laughed<lb>
blithely, and so did I; which, no doubt, caused the new nurse<lb>
to be regarded as a light-minded sinner by the Chaplain, who<lb>
roamed vaguely about, informing the men that they were all<lb>
worms, corrupt of heart, with perishable bodies, and souls only<lb>
to be saved by a diligent perusal of certain tracts, and other<lb>
equally cheering bits of spiritual consolation, when spirituous<lb>
ditto would have been preferred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mrs.!&rdquo; called a voice behind me; and, turning, I<lb>
saw a rough Michigander, with an arm blown off at the<lb>
<pb n="038">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-043">

<figdesc>Page 038.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
shoulder, and two or three bullets still in him&mdash;as he afterwards<lb>
mentioned, as carelessly as if gentlemen were in the habit of<lb>
carrying such trifles about with them. I went to him, and,<lb>
while administering a dose of soap and water, he whispered,<lb>
irefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That red-headed devil, over yonder, is a reb, damn him!<lb>
You'll agree to that, I'll bet? He's got shet of a foot, or<lb>
he'd a cut like the rest of the lot. Don't you wash him, nor<lb>
feed him, but jest let him holler till he's tired. It's a blasted<lb>
shame to fetch them fellers in here, along side of us; and so<lb>
I'll tell the chap that bosses this concern; cuss me if I don't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I regret to say that I did not deliver a moral sermon upon<lb>
the duty of forgiving our enemies, and the sin of profanity,<lb>
then and there; but, being a red-hot Abolitionist, stared<lb>
fixedly at the tall rebel, who was a copperhead, in every sense<lb>
of the word, and privately resolved to put soap in his eyes,<lb>
rub his nose the wrong way, and excoriate his cuticle generally,<lb>
if I had the washing of him.</p>
<p>My amiable intentions, however, were frustrated; for, when<lb>
I approached, with as Christian an expression as my principles<lb>
would allow, and asked the question&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I try to make<lb>
you more comfortable, sir?&rdquo; all I got for my pains was a<lb>
gruff&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I'll do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's your Southern chivalry, with a witness,&rdquo; thought<lb>
I, dumping the basin down before him, thereby quenching a<lb>
strong desire to give him a summary baptism, in return for his<lb>
ungraciousness; for my angry passions rose, at this rebuff, in<lb>
a way that would have scandalized good Dr. Watts. He was<lb>
a disappointment in all respects, (the rebel, not the blessed<lb>
Doctor,) for he was neither flendish, romantic, pathetic, or<lb>
anything interesting; but a long, fat man, with a head like a<lb>
<pb n="039">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-044">

<figdesc>Page 039.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
burning bush, and a perfectly expressionless face: so I could<lb>
hate him without the slightest drawback, and ignored his existence<lb>
from that day forth. One redeeming trait he certainly<lb>
did possess, as the floor speedily testified; for his ablutions<lb>
were so vigorously performed, that his bed soon stood like an<lb>
isolated island, in a sea of soap-suds, and he resembled a<lb>
dripping merman, suffering from the loss of a fin. If cleanliness<lb>
is a near neighbor to godliness, then was the big rebel<lb>
the godliest man in my ward that day.</p>
<p>Having done up our human wash, and laid it out to dry, the<lb>
second syllable of our version of the word war-fare was enacted<lb>
with much success. Great trays of bread, meat, soup and<lb>
coffee appeared; and both nurses and attendants turned<lb>
waiters, serving bountiful rations to all who could eat. I can<lb>
call my pinafore to testify to my good will in the work, for in<lb>
ten minutes it was reduced to a perambulating bill of fare, presenting<lb>
samples of all the refreshments going or gone. It was<lb>
a lively scene; the long room lined with rows of beds, each<lb>
filled by an occupant, whom water, shears, and clean raiment,<lb>
had transformed from a dismal ragamuffin into a recumbent<lb>
hero, with a cropped head. To and fro rushed matrons, maids,<lb>
and convalescent &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; skirmishing with knives and forks;<lb>
retreating with empty plates; marching and counter-marching,<lb>
with unvaried success, while the clash of busy spoons made<lb>
most inspiring music for the charge of our Light Brigade:</p>

<p>Very welcome seemed the generous meal, after a week of<lb>
suffering, exposure, and short commons; soon the brown faces<lb>
began to smile, as food, warmth, and rest, did their pleasant<lb>
work; and the grateful `Thankee's&rdquo; were followed by more<lb>
graphic accounts of the battle and retreat, than any paid<lb>
reporter could have given us. Curious contrasts of the tragic<lb>
and comic met one everywhere; and some touching as well as<lb>
ludicrous episodes, might have been recorded that day. A<lb>
six foot New Hampshire man, with a leg broken and perforated<lb>
by a piece of shell, so large that, had I not seen the wound, I<lb>
should have regarded the story as a Munchausenism, beckoned<lb>
me to come and help him, as he could not sit up, and both his<lb>
bed and beard were getting plentifully anointed with soup.<lb>
As I fed my big nestling with corresponding mouthfuls, I<lb>
asked him how he felt during the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, 'twas my fust, you see, so I aint ashamed to say I<lb>
was a trifle flustered in the beginnin', there was such an allfired<lb>
racket; for ef there's anything I do spleen agin, it's noise.<lb>
But when my mate, Eph Sylvester, caved, with a bullet through<lb>
his head, I got mad, and pitched in, licketty cut. Our part<lb>
of the fight didn't last long; so a lot of us larked round<lb>
Fredericksburg, and give some of them houses a pretty consid'able<lb>
of a rummage, till we was ordered out of the mess.<lb>
Some of our fellows cut like time; but I warn't a goin to run<lb>
for nobody; and, fust thing I knew, a shell bust, right in<lb>
front of us, and I keeled over, feelin' as if I was blowed<lb>
higher'n a kite. I sung out, and the boys come back for me,<lb>
double quick; but the way they chucked me over them fences<lb>
was a caution, I tell you. Next day I was most as black as<lb>
that darkey yonder, lickin' plates on the sly. This is bully<lb>
coffee, ain't it? Give us another pull at it, and I'll be obleeged<lb>
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did; and, as the last gulp subsided, he said, with a rub<lb>
of his old handkerchief over eyes as well as mouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a here; I've got a pair a earbobs and a handkercher<lb>
pin I'm a goin' to give you, if you'll have them; for you're<lb>
the very moral o' Lizy Sylvester, poor Eph's wife: that's why<lb>
I signalled you to come over here. They aint much, I guess,<lb>
but they'll do to memorize the rebs by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burrowing under his pillow, he produced a little bundle of<lb>
what he called &ldquo;truck,&rdquo; and gallantly presented me with a<lb>
pair of earrings, each representing a cluster of corpulent<lb>
grapes, and the pin a basket of astonishing fruit, the whole<lb>
large-and coppery enough for a small warming-pan. Feeling<lb>
delicate about depriving him of such valuable relies, I accepted<lb>
the earrings alone, and was obliged to depart, somewhat<lb>
abruptly, when my friend stuck the warming-pan in the bosom<lb>
of his night-gown, viewing it with much complacency, and,<lb>
perhaps, some tender memory, in that rough heart of his, for<lb>
the comrade he had lost.</p>
<p>Observing that the man next him had left his meal untouched,<lb>
I offered the same service I had performed for his neighbor,<lb>
but he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma'am; I don't think I'll ever eat again, for<lb>
I'm shot in the stomach. But I'd like a drink of water, if<lb>
you aint too busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rushed away, but the water-pails were gone to be refilled,<lb>
and it was some time before they reappeared. I did not forget<lb>
my patient patient, meanwhile, and, with the first mugful,<lb>
hurried back to him. He seemed asleep; but something in<lb>
the tired white face caused me to listen at his lips for a breath.<lb>
None came. I touched his forehead; it was cold: and then I<lb>
knew that, while he waited, a better nurse than I had given<lb>
him a cooler draught, and healed him with a touch. I laid<lb>
<pb n="042">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-047">

<figdesc>Page 042.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the sheet over the quiet sleeper, whom no noise could now<lb>
disturb; and, half an hour later, the bed was empty. It<lb>
seemed a poor requital for all he had sacrificed and suffered,&mdash;<lb>
that hospital bed, lonely even in a crowd; for there was no<lb>
familiar face for him to look his last upon; no friendly voice to say, Good bye; no hand to lead him gently down into the<lb>
Valley of the Shadow; and he vanished, like a drop in that<lb>
red sea upon whose shores so many women stand lamenting.<lb>
For a moment I felt bitterly indignant at this seeming care<lb>
lessness of the value of life, the sanctity of death; then consoled<lb>
myself with the thought that, when the great muster<lb>
roll was called, these nameless men might be promoted above<lb>
many whose tall monuments record the barren honors they<lb>
have won.</p>
<p>All having eaten, drank, and rested, the surgeons began<lb>
their rounds; and I took my first lesson in the art of dressing<lb>
wounds. It wasn't a festive scene, by any means; for Dr.<lb>
P., whose Aid I constituted myself, fell to work with a vigor<lb>
which soon convinced me that I was a weaker vessel, though<lb>
nothing would have induced me to confess it then. He had<lb>
served in the Crimea, and seemed to regard a dilapidated body<lb>
very much as I should have regarded a damaged garment;<lb>
and turning up his cuffs, whipped out a very unpleasant looking<lb>
housewife, cutting, sawing, patching and piecing, with the<lb>
enthusiasm of an accomplished surgical seamstress; explaining<lb>
the process, in scientific terms, to the patient, meantime;<lb>
which, of course, was immensely cheering and comfortable<lb>
There was an uncanny sort of fascination in watching him, as<lb>
he peered and probed into the mechanism of those wonderful<lb>
bodies, whose mysteries he understood so well. The more<lb>
intricate the wound, the better he liked it. A poor private,<lb>
with both legs off, and shot through the lungs, possessed more<lb>
<pb n="043">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-048">

<figdesc>Page 043.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
attractions for him than a dozen generals, slightly scratched in<lb>
some &ldquo;masterly retreat;&rdquo; and had any one appeared in small<lb>
pieces, requesting to be put together again, he would have<lb>
considered it a special dispensation.</p>
<p>The amputations were reserved till the morrow, and the<lb>
merciful magic of ether was not thought necessary that day, so<lb>
the poor souls had to bear their pains as best they might. It<lb>
is all very well to talk of the patience of woman; and far be<lb>
it from me to pluck that feather from her cap, for, heaven<lb>
knows, she isn't allowed to wear many; but the patient<lb>
endurance of these men, under trials of the flesh, was truly<lb>
wonderful; their fortitude seemed contagious, and scarcely a<lb>
cry escaped them, though I often longed to groan for them,<lb>
when pride kept their white lips shut, while great drops stood<lb>
upon their foreheads, and the bed shook with the irrepressible<lb>
tremor of their tortured bodies. One or two Irishmen anathematized<lb>
the doctors with the frankness of their nation, and<lb>
ordered the Virgin to stand by them, as if she had been the<lb>
wedded Biddy to whom they could administer the poker, if<lb>
she didn't; but, as a general thing, the work went on in<lb>
silence, broken only by some quiet request for roller, instruments,<lb>
or plaster, a sigh from the patient, or a sympathizing<lb>
murmur from the nurse.</p>
<p>It was long past noon before these repairs were even partially<lb>
made; and, having got the bodies of my boys into something<lb>
like order, the next task was to minister to their minds,<lb>
by writing letters to the anxious souls at home; answering<lb>
questions, reading papers, taking possession of money and<lb>
valuables; for the eighth commandmnnt was reduced to a<lb>
very fragmentary condition, both by the blacks and whites,<lb>
who ornamented our hospital with their presence. Pocket<lb>
books, purses, miniatures, and watches, were sealed up,<lb>
<pb n="044">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-049">

<figdesc>Page 044.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
labelled, and handed over to the matron, till such times as the<lb>
owners thereof were ready to depart homeward or campward<lb>
again. The letters dictated to me, and revised by me, that<lb>
afternoon, would have made an excellent chapter for some<lb>
future history of the war; for, like that which Thackeray's<lb>
&ldquo;Ensign Spooney&rdquo; wrote his mother just before Waterloo,<lb>
they were &ldquo;full of affection, pluck, and bad spelling;&rdquo; nearly<lb>
all giving lively accounts of the battle, and ending with a<lb>
somewhat sudden plunge from patriotism to provender, desiring<lb>
&ldquo;Maim,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mary Ann,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aunt Peters,&rdquo; to send<lb>
along some pies, pickles, sweet stuff, and apples, &ldquo;to yourn in<lb>
haste,&rdquo; Joe, Sam, or Ned, as the case might be.</p>
<p>My little Sergeant insisted on trying to scribble something<lb>
with his left hand, and patiently accomplished some half dozen<lb>
lines of hieroglyphies, which he gave me to fold and direct,<lb>
with a boyish blush, that rendered a glimpse of &ldquo;My Dearest<lb>
Jane,&rdquo; unnecessary, to assure me that the heroic lad had been<lb>
more successful in the service of Commander-in-Chief Cupid<lb>
than that of Gen. Mars; and a charming little romance blossomed<lb>
instanter in Nurse Periwinkle's romantic fancy, though<lb>
no further confidences were made that day, for Sergeant fell<lb>
asleep, and, judging from his tranquil face, visited his absent<lb>
sweetheart in the pleasant land of dreams.</p>
<p>At five o'clock a great bell rang, and the attendants flew,<lb>
not to arms, but to their trays, to bring up supper, when a<lb>
second uproar announced that it was ready. The new comers<lb>
woke at the sound; and I presently discovered that it took a<lb>
very bad wound to incapacitate the defenders of the faith for<lb>
the consumption of their rations; the amount that some of<lb>
them sequestered was amazing; but when I suggested the<lb>
probability of a famine hereafter, to the matron, that motherly<lb>
lady cried out: &ldquo;Bless their hearts, why shouldn't they eat?<lb>
<pb n="045">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-050">

</eaffig>
It's their only amusement; so fill every one, and, if there's<lb>
not enough ready to-night, I'll lend my share to the Lord by<lb>
giving it to the boys.&rdquo; And, whipping up her coffee-pot and<lb>
plate of toast, she gladdened the eyes and stomachs of two or<lb>
three dissatisfied heroes, by serving them with a liberal hand;<lb>
and I haven't the slightest doubt that, having cast her bread<lb>
upon the waters, it came back buttered, as another large-hearted<lb>
old lady was wont to say.</p>
<p>Then came the doctor's evening visit; the administration of<lb>
medicines; washing feverish faces; smoothing tumbled beds;<lb>
wetting wounds; singing lullabies; and preparations for the<lb>
night. By eleven, the last labor of love was done; the last<lb>
&ldquo;good night&rdquo; spoken; and, if any needed a reward for that<lb>
day's work, they surely received it, in the silent eloquence of<lb>
those long lines of faces, showing pale and peaceful in the<lb>
shaded rooms, as we quitted them, followed by grateful glances<lb>
that lighted us to bed, where rest, the sweetest, made our pillows<lb>
soft, while Night and Nature took our places, filling that<lb>
great house of pain with the healing miracles of Sleep, and<lb>
his diviner brother, Death.</p>

<p>Being fond of the night side of nature, I was soon promoted<lb>
to the post of night nurse, with every facility for indulging in<lb>
my favorite pastime of &ldquo;owling.&rdquo; My colleague, a blackeyed<lb>
widow, relieved me at dawn, we two taking care of the<lb>
ward, between us, like the immortal Sairy and Betsey, &ldquo;turn<lb>
and turn about.&rdquo; I usually found my boys in the jolliest<lb>
state of mind their condition allowed; for it was a known fact<lb>
that Nurse Periwinkle objected to blue devils, and entertained<lb>
a belief that he who laughed most was surest of recovery. At<lb>
the beginning of my reign, dumps and dismals prevailed; the<lb>
nurses looked anxious and tired, the men gloomy or sad; and a<lb>
general &ldquo;Hark!-from-the-tombs-a-doleful-sound&rdquo; style of conversation<lb>
seemed to be the fashion: a state of things which<lb>
caused one coming from a merry, social New England town, to<lb>
feel as if she had got into an exhausted receiver; and the<lb>
instinct of self-preservation, to say nothing of a philanthropic<lb>
desire to serve the race, caused a speedy change in Ward<lb>
No. 1.</p>

<p>More flattering than the most gracefully turned compliment,<lb>
more grateful than the most admiring glance, was the sight of<lb>
those rows of faces, all strange to me a little while ago, now<lb>
lighting up, with smiles of welcome, as I came among them,<lb>
enjoying that moment heartily, with a womanly pride in their<lb>
regard, a motherly affection for them all. The evenings were<lb>
spent in reading aloud, writing letters, waiting on and amusing<lb>
the men, going the rounds with Dr. P, as he made his second<lb>
daily survey, dressing my dozen wounds afresh, giving last<lb>
doses, and making them cozy for the long hours to come, till<lb>
the nine o'clock bell rang, the gas was turned down, the day<lb>
nurses went off duty, the night watch came on, and my nocturnal<lb>
adventure began.</p>
<p>My ward was now divided into three rooms; and, under<lb>
favor of the matron, I had managed to sort out the patients in<lb>
such a way that I had what I called, &ldquo;my duty room,&rdquo; my<lb>
&ldquo;pleasure room,&rdquo; and my &ldquo;pathetic room,&rdquo; and worked for<lb>
each in a different way. One, I visited, armed with a dressing<lb>
tray, full of rollers, plasters, and pins; another, with books,<lb>
flowers, games, and gossip; a third, with teapots, lullabies,<lb>
consolation, and, sometimes, a shroud.</p>
<p>Wherever the sickest or most helpless man chanced to be,<lb>
there I held my watch, often visiting the other rooms, to see<lb>
that the general watchman of the ward did his duty by the<lb>
fires and the wounds, the latter needing constant wetting.<lb>
Not only on this account did I meander, but also to get fresher<lb>
air than the close rooms afforded; for, owing to the stupidity<lb>
of that mysterious &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; who does all the damage<lb>
in the world, the windows had been carefully nailed down<lb>
above, and the lower sashes could only be raised in the mildest<lb>
weather, for the men lay just below. I had suggested a summary<lb>
smashing of a few panes here and there, when frequent<lb>
<pb n="048">

</eaffig>
appeals to headquarters had proved unavailing, and daily<lb>
orders to lazy attendants had come to nothing. No one seconded<lb>
the motion, however, and the nails were far beyond my<lb>
reach; for, though belonging to the sisterhood of &ldquo;ministering<lb>
angels,&rdquo; I had no wings, and might as well have asked for<lb>
Jacob's ladder, as a pair of steps, in that charitable chaos.</p>
<p>One of the harmless ghosts who bore me company during<lb>
the haunted hours, was Dan, the watchman, whom I regarded<lb>
with a certain awe; for, though so much together, I never<lb>
fairly saw his face, and, but for his legs, should never have<lb>
recognized him, as we seldom met by day. These legs were<lb>
remarkable, as was his whole figure, for his body was short,<lb>
rotund, and done up in a big jacket, and muffler; his beard<lb>
hid the lower part of his face, his hat-brim the upper; and all<lb>
I ever discovered was a pair of sleepy eyes, and a very mild<lb>
voice. But the legs! &mdash; very long, very thin, very crooked<lb>
and feeble, looking like grey sausages in their tight coverings,<lb>
without a ray of pegtopishness about them, and finished off<lb>
with a pair of expansive, green cloth shoes, very like Chinese<lb>
junks, with the sails down. This figure, gliding noiselessly<lb>
about the dimly lighted rooms, was strongly suggestive of the<lb>
spirit of a beer barrel mounted on cork-screws, haunting the<lb>
old hotel in search of its lost mates, emptied and staved in<lb>
long ago.</p>
<p>Another goblin who frequently appeared to me, was the<lb>
attendant of the pathetic room, who, being a faithful soul, was<lb>
often up to tend two or three men, weak and wandering as<lb>
babies, after the fever had gone. The amiable creature beguiled<lb>
the watches of the night by brewing jorums of a fearful beverage,<lb>
which he called coffee, and insisted on sharing with<lb>
me; coming in with a great bowl of something like mud<lb>
soup, scalding hot, guiltless of cream, rich in an all-pervading<lb>
<pb n="049">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-054">

<figdesc>Page 049.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
flavor of molasses, scorch and tin pot. Such an amount of<lb>
good will and neighborly kindness also went into the mess,<lb>
that I never could find the heart to refuse, but always received<lb>
it with thanks, sipped it with hypocritical relish while he<lb>
remained, and whipped it into the slop-jar the instant he<lb>
departed, thereby gratifying him, securing one rousing laugh<lb>
in the doziest hour of the night, and no one was the worse for<lb>
the transaction but the pigs. Whether they were &ldquo;cut off<lb>
untimely in their sins,&rdquo; or not, I carefully abstained from<lb>
inquiring.</p>
<p>It was a strange life &mdash; asleep half the day, exploring<lb>
Washington the other half, and all night hovering, like a<lb>
massive cherubim, in a red rigolette, over the slumbering sons<lb>
of man. I liked it, and found many things to amuse, instruct,<lb>
and interest me. The snores alone were quite a study, varying<lb>
from the mild sniff to the stentorian snort, which startled the<lb>
echoes and hoisted the performer erect to accuse his neighbor<lb>
of the deed, magnanimously forgive him, and, wrapping the<lb>
drapery of his couch about him, lie down to vocal slumber.<lb>
After listening for a week to this band of wind instruments, I<lb>
indulged in the belief that I could recognize each by the snore<lb>
alone, and was tempted to join the chorus by breaking out<lb>
with John Brown's favorite hymn:</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;Blow ye the trumpet, blow!&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>I would have given much to have possessed the art of<lb>
sketching, for many of the faces became wonderfully interesting<lb>
when unconscious. Some grew stern and grim, the men<lb>
evidently dreaming of war, as they gave orders, groancd over<lb>
their wounds, or damned the rebels vigorously; some grew sad<lb>
and infinitely pathetic, as if the pain borne silently all day, revenged<lb>
itself by now betraying what the man's pride had concealed<lb>
so well. Often the roughest grew young and pleasant<lb>
<pb n="050">

</eaffig>
when sleep smoothed the hard lines away, letting the real nature<lb>
assert itself; many almost seemed to speak, and I learned to<lb>
know these men better by night than through any intercourse<lb>
by day. Sometimes they disappointed me, for faces that looked<lb>
merry and good in the light, grew bad and sly when the shadows<lb>
came; and though they made no confidences in words, I<lb>
read their lives, leaving them to wonder at the change of manner<lb>
this midnight magic wrought in their nurse. A few talked<lb>
busily; one drummer boy sang sweetly, though no persuasions<lb>
could win a note from him by day; and several depended on<lb>
being told what they had talked of in the morning. Even my<lb>
constitutionals in the chilly halls, possessed a certain charm,<lb>
for the house was never still. Sentinels tramped round it all<lb>
night long, their muskets glittering in the wintry moonlight as<lb>
they walked, or stood before the doors, straight and silent, as<lb>
figures of stone, causing one to conjure up romantic visions of<lb>
guarded forts, sudden surprises, and daring deeds; for in<lb>
these war times the hum drum life of Yankeedom has vanished,<lb>
and the most prosaic feel some thrill of that excitement which<lb>
stirs the nation's heart, and makes its capital a camp of hospitals.<lb>
Wandering up and down these lower halls, I often heard<lb>
cries from above, steps hurrying to and fro, saw surgeons<lb>
passing up, or men coming down carrying a stretcher, where<lb>
lay a long white figure, whose face was shrouded and whose<lb>
fight was done. Sometimes I stopped to watch the passers in<lb>
the street, the moonlight shining on the spire opposite, or the<lb>
gleam of some vessel floating, like a white-winged sea-gull,<lb>
down the broad Potomac, whose fullest flow can never wash<lb>
away the red stain of the land.</p>
<p>The night whose events I have a fancy to record, opened<lb>
with a little comedy, and closed with a great tragedy; for a<lb>
virtuous and useful life untimely ended is always tragical to<lb>
<pb n="051">

</eaffig>
those who see not as God sees. My headquarters were beside<lb>
the bed of a New Jersey boy, crazed by the horrors of that<lb>
dreadful Saturday. A slight wound in the knee brought him<lb>
there; but his mind had suffered more than his body; some<lb>
string of that delicate machine was over strained, and, for<lb>
days, he had been reliving, in imagination, the scenes he could<lb>
not forget, till his distress broke out in incoherent ravings,<lb>
pitiful to hear. As I sat by him, endeavoring to soothe his<lb>
poor distracted brain by the constant touch of wet hands over<lb>
his hot forehead, he lay cheering his comrades on, hurrying<lb>
them back, then counting them as they fell around him, often<lb>
clutching my arm, to drag me from the vicinity of a bursting<lb>
shell, or covering up his head to screen himself from a shower<lb>
of shot; his face brilliant with fever; his eyes restless; his<lb>
head never still; every muscle strained and rigid; while an<lb>
incessant stream of defiant shouts, whispered warnings, and<lb>
broken laments, poured from his lips with that forceful bewilderment<lb>
which makes such wanderings so hard to overhear.</p>
<p>It was past eleven, and my patient was slowly wearying<lb>
himself into fitful intervals of quietude, when, in one of these<lb>
pauses, a curious sound arrested my attention. Looking over<lb>
my shoulder, I saw a one-legged phantom hopping nimbly<lb>
down the room; and, going to meet it, recognized a certain<lb>
Pennsylvania gentleman, whose wound-fever had taken a turn<lb>
for the worse, and, depriving him of the few wits a drunken<lb>
campaign had left him, set him literally tripping on the light,<lb>
fantastic toe &ldquo;toward home,&rdquo; as he blandly informed me,<lb>
touching the military cap which formed a striking contrast to<lb>
the severe simplicity of the rest of his decidedly <hi rend="italics">undress</hi> uniform.<lb>
When sane, the least movement produced a roar of<lb>
pain or a volley of oaths; but the departure of reason seemed<lb>
to have wrought an agreeable change, both in the man and his<lb>
<pb n="052">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-057">

<figdesc>Page 052.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
manners; for, balancing himself on one leg, like a meditative<lb>
stork, he plunged into an animated discussion of the war, the<lb>
President, lager beer, and Enfleld rifles, regardless of any<lb>
suggestions of mine as to the propriety of returning to bed,<lb>
lest he be court martialed for desertion.</p>
<p>Anything more supremely ridiculous can hardly be imagined<lb>
than this figure, scantily draped in white, its one foot<lb>
covered with a big blue sock, a dingy cap set rakingly askew<lb>
on its shaven head, and plaeid satisfaction beaming in its<lb>
broad red face, as it flourished a mug in one hand, an old<lb>
boot in the other, calling them canteen and knapsack, while it<lb>
skipped and fluttered in the most uncarthly fashion. What to<lb>
do with the creature I didn't know; Dan was absent, and if I<lb>
went to find him, the perambulator might festoon himself out<lb>
of the window, set his toga on fire, or do some of his neighbors<lb>
a mischief. The attendant of the room was sleeping like a<lb>
near relative of the celebrated Seven, and nothing short of<lb>
pins would rouse him; for he had been out that day, and whiskey<lb>
asserted its supremacy in balmy whiffs. Still declaiming,<lb>
in a fine flow of eloquence, the demented gentleman hopped<lb>
on, blind and deaf to my graspings and entreaties; and I<lb>
was about to slam the door in his face, and run for help, when<lb>
a second and saner phantom, &ldquo;all in white,&rdquo; came to the rescue,<lb>
in the likeness of a big Prussian, who spoke no English,<lb>
but divined the crisis, and put an end to it, by bundling the<lb>
lively monoped into his bed, like a baby, with an authoritative<lb>
command to &ldquo;stay put,&rdquo; which received added weight from<lb>
being delivered in an odd conglomeration of French and German,<lb>
accompanied by warning wags of a head decorated with<lb>
a yellow cotton night cap, rendered most imposing by a tassel<lb>
like a bell-pull. Rather exhausted by his excursion, the member<lb>
from Pennsylvania subsided; and, after an irrepressible<lb>
<pb n="053">

<figdesc>Page 053.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
laugh together, my Prussian ally and myself were returning<lb>
to our places, when the echo of a sob caused us to glance along<lb>
the beds. It came from one in the corner &mdash; such a little bed!&mdash;<lb>
and such a tearful little face looked up at us, as we stopped<lb>
beside it! The twelve years old drummer boy was not sing<lb>
ing now, but sobbing, with a manly effort all the while to stifle<lb>
the distressful sounds that would break out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Teddy!&rdquo; I asked, as he rubbed the tears<lb>
away, and checked himself in the middle of a great sob to<lb>
answer plaintively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've got a chill, ma'am, but I aint cryin' for that, 'cause<lb>
I'm used to it. I dreamed Kit was here, and when I waked<lb>
up he wasn't, and I couldn't help it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy came in with the rest, and the man who was taken<lb>
dead from the ambulance was the Kit be mourned. Well he<lb>
might; for, when the wounded were brought from Fredericksburg,<lb>
the child lay in one of the camps thereabout, and<lb>
this good friend, though sorely hurt himself, would not leave<lb>
him to the exposure and neglect of such a time and place;<lb>
but, wrapping him in his own blanket, carried him in his arms<lb>
to the transport, tended him during the passage, and only<lb>
yielded up his charge when Death met him at the door of<lb>
the hospital which promised care and comfort for the boy.<lb>
For ten days, Teddy had shivered or burned with fever and<lb>
ague, pining the while for Kit, and refusing to be comforted,<lb>
because he had not been able to thank him for the generous<lb>
protection, which, perhaps, had cost the giver's life. The<lb>
vivid dream had wrung the childish heart with a fresh pang,<lb>
and when I tried the solace fitted for his years, the remorseful<lb>
fear that haunted him found vent in a fresh burst of tears, as<lb>
he looked at the wasted hands I was endeavoring to warm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if I'd only been as thin when Kit carried me as I am<lb>
<pb n="054">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-059">

<figdesc>Page 054.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
now, maybe he wouldn't have died; but I was heavy, he was<lb>
hurt worser than we knew, and so it killed him; and I didn't<lb>
see him, to say good bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thought had troubled him in secret; and my assurances<lb>
that his friend would probably have died at all events,<lb>
hardly assuaged the bitterness of his regretful grief.</p>
<p>At this juncture, the delirious man began to shout; the one-legged<lb>
rose up in his bed, as if preparing for another dart;<lb>
Teddy be wailed himself more piteously than before: and if<lb>
ever a woman was at her wit's end, that distracted female was<lb>
Nurse Periwinkle, during the space of two or three minutes,<lb>
as she vibrated between the three beds, like an agitated pendulum.<lb>
Like a most opportune reinforcement, Dan, the bandy,<lb>
appeared, and devoted himself to the lively party, leaving me<lb>
free to return to my post; for the Prussian, with a nod and a<lb>
smile, took the lad away to his own bed, and lulled him to<lb>
sleep with a soothing murmur, like a mammoth humble bee.<lb>
I liked that in Fritz, and if he ever wondered afterward at the<lb>
dainties which sometimes found their way into his rations, or<lb>
the extra comforts of his bed, he might have found a solution<lb>
of the mystery in sundry persons' knowledge of the fatherly<lb>
action of that night.</p>
<p>Hardly was I settled again, when the inevitable bowl<lb>
appeared, and its bearer delivered a message I had expected,<lb>
yet dreaded to receive:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John is going, ma'am, and wants to see you, if you can<lb>
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment this boy is asleep; tell him so, and let me<lb>
know if I am in danger of being too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My. Ganymede departed, and while I quieted poor Shaw, I<lb>
thought of John. He came in a day or two after the others;<lb>
and, one evening, when I entered my &ldquo;pathetic room,&rdquo; I<lb>
<pb n="055">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-060">

<figdesc>Page 055.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
found a lately emptied bed occupied by a large, fair man,<lb>
with a fine face, and the serenest eyes I ever met. One of<lb>
the earlier comers had often spoken of a friend, who had<lb>
remained behind, that those apparently worse wounded than<lb>
himself might reach a shelter first. It seemed a David and<lb>
Jonathan sort of friendship. The man fretted for his mate,<lb>
and was never tired of praising John&mdash;his courage, sobriety,<lb>
self-denial, and unfailing kindliness of heart: always winding<lb>
up with: &ldquo;He's an out an'out fine feller, ma'am; you see<lb>
if he aint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence, and<lb>
when he came, watched him for a night or two, before I made<lb>
friends with him; for, to tell the truth, I was a little afraid of<lb>
the stately looking man, whose bed had to be lengthened to<lb>
accommodate his commanding stature; who seldom spoke,<lb>
uttered no complaint, asked no sympathy, but tranquilly<lb>
observed what went on about him; and, as he lay high upon<lb>
his pillows, no picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever<lb>
fuller of real dignity than this Virginia blacksmith. A most<lb>
attractive face he had, framed in brown hair and beard, comely<lb>
featured and full of vigor, as yet unsubdued by pain; thoughtful<lb>
and often beautifully mild while watching the afflictions of<lb>
others, as if entirely forgetful of his own. His mouth was<lb>
grave and firm, with plenty of will and courage in its lines,<lb>
but a smile could make it as sweet as any woman's; and his<lb>
eyes were child's eyes, looking one fairly in the face, with a<lb>
clear, straightforward glance, which promised well for such as<lb>
placed their faith in him. He seemed to cling to life, as if it<lb>
were rich in duties and delights, and he had learned the secret<lb>
of content. The only time I saw his composure disturbed,<lb>
was when my surgeon brought another to examine John, who<lb>
scrutinized their faces with an anxious look, asking of the<lb>
<pb n="056">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-061">

<figdesc>Page 056.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
elder: &ldquo;Do you think I shall pull through, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope<lb>
so, my man.&rdquo; And, as the two passed on, John's eye still<lb>
followed them, with an intentness which would have won a<lb>
clearer answer from them, had they seen it. A momentary<lb>
shadow flitted over his face; then came the usual serenity, as<lb>
if, in that brief eclipse, he had acknowledged the existence of<lb>
some hard possibility, and, asking nothing yet hoping all<lb>
things, left the issue in God's hands, with that submission<lb>
which is true piety.</p>
<p>The next night, as I went my rounds with Dr. P., I<lb>
happened to ask which man in the room probably suffered<lb>
most; and, to my great surprise, he glanced at John:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every breath he draws is like a stab; for the ball pierced<lb>
the left lung, broke a rib, and did no end of damage here and<lb>
there; so the poor lad can find neither forgetfulness nor ease,<lb>
because he must lie on his wounded back or suffocate. It<lb>
will be a hard struggle, and a long one, for he possesses great<lb>
vitality; but even his temperate life can't save him; I wish it<lb>
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't mean he must die, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, there's not the slightest hope for him; and<lb>
you'd better tell him so before long; women have a way of<lb>
doing such things comfortably, so I leave it to you. He<lb>
won't last more than a day or two, at furthest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily, if I<lb>
had not learned the wisdom of bottling up one's tears for<lb>
leisure moments. Such an end seemed very hard for such a<lb>
man, when half a dozen worn out, worthless bodies round him,<lb>
were gathering up the remnants of wasted lives, to linger on<lb>
for years perhaps, burdens to others, daily reproaches to<lb>
themselves. The army needed men like John, earnest, brave,<lb>
and faithful; fighting for liberty and justice with both heart<lb>
<pb n="057">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-062">

<figdesc>Page 057.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and hand, true soldiers of the Lord. I could not give him<lb>
up so soon, or think with any patience of so excellent a nature<lb>
robbed of its fulfiment, and blundered into eternity by the<lb>
rashness or stupidity of those at whose hands so many lives<lb>
may be required. It was an easy thing for Dr. P. to say:<lb>
&ldquo;Tell him he must die,&rdquo; but a cruelly hard thing to do, and<lb>
by no means as &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; as he politely suggested. I<lb>
had not the heart to do it then, and privately indulged the<lb>
hope that some change for the better might take place, in spite<lb>
of gloomy prophesies; so, rendering my task unnecessary. A<lb>
few minutes later, as I came in again, with fresh rollers, I saw<lb>
John sitting erect, with no one to support him, while the<lb>
surgeon dressed his back. I had never hitherto seen it done;<lb>
for, having simpler wounds to attend to, and knowing the<lb>
fidelity of the attendant, I had left John to him, thinking<lb>
it might be more agreeable and safe; for both strength and<lb>
experience were needed in his case. I had forgotten that the<lb>
strong man might long for the gentler tendance of a woman's<lb>
hands, the sympathetic magnetism of a woman's presence, as<lb>
well as the feebler souls about him. The Doctor's words<lb>
caused me to reproach myself with neglect, not of any real<lb>
duty perhaps, but of those little cares and kindnesses that<lb>
solace homesick spirits, and make the heavy hours pass easier.<lb>
John looked lonely and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent<lb>
head, hands folded on his knee, and no outward sign of suffering,<lb>
till, looking nearer, I saw great tears roll down and drop<lb>
upon the floor. It was a new sight there; for, though I had<lb>
seen many suffer, some swore, some groaned, most endured<lb>
silently, but none wept. Yet it did not seem weak, only very<lb>
touching, and straightway my fear vanished, my heart opened<lb>
wide and took him in, as, gathering the bent head in my arms,<lb>
<pb n="058">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-063">

<figdesc>Page 058.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
as freely as if he had been a little child, I said, &ldquo;Let me<lb>
help you bear it, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never, on any human countenance, have I seen so swift<lb>
and beautiful a look of gratitude, surprise and comfort, as that<lb>
which answered me more eloquently than the whispered &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma'am, this is right good! this is what I<lb>
wanted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not ask for it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't like to be a trouble; you seemed so busy, and I<lb>
could manage to get on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not want it any more, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did he; for now I understood the wistful look that<lb>
sometimes followed me, as I went out, after a brief pause<lb>
beside his bed, or merely a passing nod, while busied with<lb>
those who seemed to need me more than he, because more<lb>
urgent in their demands; now I knew that to him, as to so<lb>
many, I was the poor substitute for mother, wife, or sister,<lb>
and in his eyes no stranger, but a friend who hitherto had<lb>
seemed neglectful; for, in his modesty, he had never guessed<lb>
the truth. This was changed now; and, through the tedious<lb>
operation of probing, bathing, and dressing his wounds, he<lb>
leaned against me, holding my hand fast, and, if pain wrung<lb>
further tears from him, no one saw them fall but me. When<lb>
he was laid down again, I hovered about him, in a remorseful<lb>
state of mind that would not let me rest, till I had bathed his<lb>
face, brushed his &ldquo;bonny brown hair,&rdquo; set all things smooth<lb>
about him, and laid a knot of heath and heliotrope on his<lb>
clean pillow. While doing this, he watched me with the satisfied<lb>
expression I so liked to see; and when I offered the<lb>
little nosegay, held it carefully in his great hand, smoothed a<lb>
ruffled leaf or two, surveyed and smelt it with an air of<lb>
genuine delight, and lay contentedly regarding the glimmer of<lb>
<pb n="059">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-064">

<figdesc>Page 059.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the sunshine on the green. Although the manliest man among<lb>
my forty, he said, &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; like a little boy; received<lb>
suggestions for his comfort with the quick smile that brightened<lb>
his whole face; and now and then, as I stood tidying the<lb>
table by his bed, I felt him softly touch my gown, as if to<lb>
assure himself that I was there. Anything more natural and<lb>
frank I never saw, and found this brave John as bashful as<lb>
brave, yet full of excellencies and fine aspirations, which,<lb>
having no power to express themselves in words, seemed to<lb>
have bloomed into his character and made him what he was.</p>
<p>After that night, an hour of each evening that remained to<lb>
him was devoted to his ease or pleasure. He could not talk<lb>
much, for breath was precious, and he spoke in whispers; but<lb>
from occasional conversations, I gleaned scraps of private<lb>
history which only added to the affection and respect I felt for<lb>
him. Once he asked me to write a letter, and as I settled pen<lb>
and paper, I said, with an irrepressible glimmer of feminine<lb>
curiosity, &ldquo;Shall it be addressed to wife, or mother, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, ma'am; I've got no wife, and will write to<lb>
mother myself when I get better. Did you think I was<lb>
married because of this?&rdquo; he asked, touching a plain ring he<lb>
wore, and often turned thoughtfully on his finger when he lay<lb>
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly that, but more from a settled sort of look you<lb>
have, a look which young men seldom get until they marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know that; but I'm not so very young, ma'am,<lb>
thirty in May, and have been what you might call settled this<lb>
ten years; for mother's a widow, I'm the oldest child she has,<lb>
and it wouldn't do for me to marry until Lizzy has a home of<lb>
her own, and Laurie's learned his trade; for we're not rich,<lb>
and I must be father to the children and husband to the dear<lb>
old woman, if I can.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt but you are both, John; yet how came you to<lb>
go to war, if you felt so? Wasn't enlisting as bad as marrying?&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am, not as I see it, for one is helping my neighbor,<lb>
the other pleasing myself. I went because I couldn't help it.<lb>
I didn't want the glory or the pay; I wanted the right thing<lb>
done, and people kept saying the men who were in earnest<lb>
ought to fight. I was in earnest, the Lord knows! but I held<lb>
off as long as I could, not knowing which was my duty;<lb>
mother saw the case, gave me her ring to keep me steady, and<lb>
said `Go:' so I went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short story and a simple one, but the man and the mother<lb>
were portrayed better than pages of fine writing could have<lb>
done it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever regret that you came, when you lie here<lb>
suffering so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, ma'am; I haven't helped a great deal, but I've<lb>
shown I was willing to give my life, and perhaps I've got to;<lb>
but I don't blame anybody, and if it was to do over again, I'd<lb>
do if. I'm a little sorry I wasn't wounded in front; it looks<lb>
cowardly to be hit in the back, but I obeyed orders, and it<lb>
don't matter in the end, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor John! it did not matter now, except that a shot in<lb>
front might have spared the long agony in store for him. He<lb>
seemed to read the thought that troubled me, as he spoke so<lb>
hopefully when there was no hope, for he suddenly added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my first battle; do they think it's going to be my<lb>
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid they do, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the hardest question I had ever been called upon to<lb>
answer; doubly hard with those clear eyes fixed on mine,<lb>
forcing a truthful answer by their own truth. He seemed a<lb>
<pb n="061">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-066">

<figdesc>Page 061.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
little startled at first, pondered over the fateful fact a moment<lb>
then shook his head, with a glance at the broad chest and<lb>
muscular limbs stretched out before him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not afraid, but it's difficult to believe all at once. I'm<lb>
so strong it don't seem possible for such a little wound to kill<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merry Mercutio's dying words glanced through my memory<lb>
as he spoke: &ldquo; 'Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a<lb>
church door, but 'tis enough.&rdquo; And John would have said<lb>
the same could he have seen the ominous black holes between<lb>
his shoulders, he never had; and, seeing the ghastly sights<lb>
about him, could not believe his own wound more fatal than<lb>
these, for all the suffering it caused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I write to your mother, now?&rdquo; I asked, thinking<lb>
that these sudden tidings might change all plans and puposes;<lb>
but they did not; for the man received the order of the Divine<lb>
Commander to march with the same unquestioning obedience<lb>
with which the soldier had received that of the human one,<lb>
doubtless remembering that the first led him to life, and the<lb>
last to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am; to Laurie just the same; he'll break it to<lb>
her best, and I'll add a line to her myself when you get<lb>
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I wrote the letter which he dictated, finding it better<lb>
than any I had sent; for, though here and there a little ungram<lb>
matical or inelegant, each sentence came to me briefly worded,<lb>
but most expressive; full of excellent counsel to the boy,<lb>
tenderly bequeathing &ldquo;mother and Lizzie&rdquo; to his care, and<lb>
bidding him good bye in words the sadder for their simplicity.<lb>
He added a few lines, with steady hand, and, as I sealed it,<lb>
said, with a patient sort of sigh, &ldquo;I hope the answer will<lb>
come in time for me to see it;&rdquo; then, turning away his face,<lb>
<pb n="062">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-067">

<figdesc>Page 062.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
laid the flowers against his lips, as if to hide some quiver of<lb>
emotion at the thought of such a sudden sundering of all the<lb>
dear home ties.</p>
<p>These things had happened two days before; now John<lb>
was dying, and the letter had not come. I had been summoned<lb>
to many death beds in my life, but to none that made<lb>
my heart ache as it did then, since my mother called me to<lb>
watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its gentleness<lb>
and patient strength. As I went in, John stretched out both<lb>
hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you'd come! I guess I'm moving on, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was; and so rapidly that, even while he spoke, over his<lb>
face I saw the grey veil falling that no human hand can lift.<lb>
I sat down by him, wiped the drops from his forehead, stirred<lb>
the air about him with the slow wave of a fan, and waited to<lb>
help him die. He stood in sore need of help&mdash;and I could<lb>
do so little; for, as the doctor had foretold, the strong body<lb>
rebelled against death, and fought every inch of the way,<lb>
forcing him to draw each breath with a spasm, and clench his<lb>
hands with an imploring look, as if he asked, &ldquo;How long<lb>
must I endure this, and be still!&rdquo; For hours he suffered<lb>
dumbly, without a moment's respite, or a moment's murmuring;<lb>
his limbs grew cold, his face damp, his lips white, and, again<lb>
and again, he tore the covering off his breast, as if the lightest<lb>
weight added to his agony; yet through it all, his eyes never<lb>
lost their perfect serenity, and the man's soul seemed to sit<lb>
therein, undaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh.</p>
<p>One by one, the men woke, and round the room appeared<lb>
a circle of pale faces and watchful eyes, full of awe and pity;<lb>
for, though a stranger, John was beloved by all. Each man<lb>
there had wondered at his patience, respected his piety, admired<lb>
his fortitude, and now lamented his hard death; for the<lb>
<pb n="063">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-068">

<figdesc>Page 063.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
influence of an upright nature had made itself deeply felt,<lb>
even in one little week. Presently, the Jonathan who so<lb>
loved this comely David, came creeping from his bed for a<lb>
last look and word. The kind soul was full of trouble, as the<lb>
choke in his voice, the grasp of his hand, betrayed; but there<lb>
were no tears, and the farewell of the friends was the more<lb>
touching for its brevity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old boy, how are you?&rdquo; faltered the one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most through, thank heaven!&rdquo; whispered the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I say or do anything for you anywheres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my things home, and tell them that I did my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will! I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, John, good bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed each other, tenderly as women, and so parted,<lb>
for poor Ned could not stay to see his comrade die. For a<lb>
little while, there was no sound in the room but the drip of<lb>
water, from a stump or two, and John's distressful gasps, as<lb>
he slowly breathed his life away. I thought him nearly gone,<lb>
and had just laid down the fan, believing its help to be no<lb>
longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his bed, and cried<lb>
out with a bitter cry that broke the silence, sharply startling<lb>
every one with its agonized appeal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God's sake, give me air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the only cry pain or death had wrung from him, the<lb>
only boon he had asked; and none of us could grant it, for<lb>
all the airs that blew were useless now. Dan flung up the<lb>
window. The first red streak of dawn was warming the grey<lb>
east, a herald of the coming sun; John saw it, and with the<lb>
love of light which lingers in us to the end, seemed to read in<lb>
it a sign of hope of help, for, over his whole face there broke<lb>
that mysterious expression, brighter than any smile, which<lb>
<pb n="064"><target id="p441-069">p441-069</target>
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-069">

<figdesc>Page 064.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
often comes to eyes that look their last. He laid himself<lb>
gently down; and, stretching out his strong right arm, as if to<lb>
grasp and bring the blessed air to his lips in a fuller flow,<lb>
lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness, which assured us that<lb>
for him suffering was forever past. He died then; for, though<lb>
the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little longer,<lb>
they were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt<lb>
against the wreck, which an immortal voyager had deserted<lb>
with a smile. He never spoke again, but to the end held my<lb>
hand close, so close that when he was asleep at last, I could<lb>
not draw it away. Dan helped me, warning me as he did so<lb>
that it was unsafe for dead and living flesh to lie so long<lb>
together; but though my hand was strangely cold and stiff,<lb>
and four white marks remained across its back, even when<lb>
warmth and color had returned elsewhere, I could not but be<lb>
glad that, through its touch, the presence of human sympathy,<lb>
perhaps, had lightened that hard hour.</p>
<p>When they had made him ready for the grave, John lay in<lb>
state for half an hour, a thing which seldom happened in that<lb>
busy place; but a universal sentiment of reverence and<lb>
affection seemed to fill the hearts of all who had known or<lb>
heard of him; and when the rumor of his death went through<lb>
the house, always astir, many came to see him, and I felt a<lb>
tender sort of pride in my lost patient; for he looked a most<lb>
heroic figure, lying there stately and still as the statue of some<lb>
young knight asleep upon his tomb. The lovely expression<lb>
which so often beautifies dead faces, soon replaced the marks<lb>
of pain, and I longed for those who loved him best to see him<lb>
when half an hour's acquaintance with Death had made them<lb>
friends. As we stood looking at him, the ward master handed<lb>
me a letter, saying it had been forgotten the night before. It<lb>
was John's letter, come just an hour too late to gladden the<lb>
<pb n="065">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-070">

<figdesc>Page 065.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
eyes that had longed and looked for it so eagerly: yet he had<lb>
it; for, after I had cut some brown locks for his mother, and<lb>
taken off the ring to send her, telling how well the talisman<lb>
had done its work, I kissed this good son for her sake, and<lb>
laid the letter in his hand, still folded as when I drew my<lb>
own away, feeling that its place was there, and making myself<lb>
happy with the thought, that, even in his solitary place in the<lb>
&ldquo;Government Lot,&rdquo; he would not be without some token of<lb>
the love which makes life beautiful and outlives death. Then<lb>
I left him, glad to have known so genuine a man, and carrying<lb>
with me an enduring memory of the brave Virginia blacksmith,<lb>
as he lay serenely waiting for the dawn of that long day<lb>
which knows no night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, we shall have you sick in your bed, unless<lb>
you keep yourself warm and quiet for a few days. Widow<lb>
Wadman can take care of the ward alone, now the men are so<lb>
comfortable, and have her vacation when you are about again.<lb>
Now do be prudent in time, and don't let me have to add a<lb>
Periwinkle to my bouquet of patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This advice was delivered, in a paternal manner, by the<lb>
youngest surgeon in the hospital, a kind-hearted little gentleman,<lb>
who seemed to consider me a frail young blossom, that<lb>
needed much cherishing, instead of a tough old spinster, who<lb>
had been knocking about the world for thirty years. At the<lb>
time I write of, he discovered me sitting on the stairs, with a<lb>
nice cloud of unwholesome steam rising from the washroom;<lb>
a party of January breezes disporting themselves in the halls;<lb>
and perfumes, by no means from &ldquo;Araby the blest,&rdquo; keeping<lb>
them company; while I enjoyed a fit of coughing, which<lb>
caused my head to spin in a way that made the application of<lb>
a cool banister both necessary and agreeable, as I waited for<lb>
<pb n="067">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-072">

<figdesc>Page 067.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the frolicsome wind to restore the breath I'd lost; cheering<lb>
myself, meantime, with a secret conviction that pneumonia<lb>
was waiting for me round the corner. This piece of advice<lb>
had been offered by several persons for a week, and refused<lb>
by me with the obstinacy with which my sex is so richly gifted.<lb>
But the last few hours had developed several surprising internal<lb>
and external phenomena, which impressed upon me the fact<lb>
that if I didn't make a masterly retreat very soon, I should<lb>
tumble down somewhere, and have to be borne ignominiously<lb>
from the field. My head felt like a cannon ball; my feet had<lb>
a tendency to cleave to the floor; the walls at times undulated<lb>
in a most disagreeable manner; people looked unnaturally<lb>
big; and the &ldquo;very bottles on the mankle shelf&rdquo; appeared to<lb>
dance derisively before my eyes. Taking these things into<lb>
consideration, while blinking stupidly at Dr. Z., I resolved to<lb>
retire gracefully, if I must; so, with a valedictory to my boys,<lb>
a private lecture to Mrs. Wadman, and a fervent wish that I<lb>
could take off my body and work in my soul, I mournfully<lb>
ascended to my apartment, and Nurse P. was reported off<lb>
duty.</p>
<p>For the benefit of any ardent damsel whose patriotic fancy<lb>
may have surrounded hospital life with a halo of charms, I<lb>
will briefly describe the bower to which I retired, in a somewhat<lb>
ruinous condition. It was well ventilated, for five panes of<lb>
glass had suffered compound fractures, which all the surgeons<lb>
and nurses had failed to heal; the two windows were draped<lb>
with sheets, the church hospital opposite being a brick and<lb>
mortar Argus, and the female mind cherishing a prejudice in<lb>
favor of retiracy during the night-capped periods of existence.<lb>
A bare floor supported two narrow iron beds, spread with thin<lb>
mattrasses like plasters, furnished with pillows in the last<lb>
stages of consumption. In a fire place, guiltless of shovel,<lb>
<pb n="068">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-073">

<figdesc>Page 068.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
tongs, andirons, or grate, burned a log, inch by inch, being too<lb>
long to go on all at once; so, while the fire blazed away at one<lb>
end, I did the same at the other, as I tripped over it a dozen<lb>
times a day, and flew up to poke it a dozen times at night. A<lb>
mirror (let us be elegant!) of the dimensions of a muffin,<lb>
and about as reflective, hung over a tin basin, blue pitcher,<lb>
and a brace of yellow mugs. Two invalid tables, ditto chairs,<lb>
wandered here and there, and the closet contained a varied<lb>
collection of bonnets, bottles, bags, boots, bread and butter,<lb>
boxes and bugs. The closet was a regular Blue Beard<lb>
cupboard to me; I always opened it with fear and trembling,<lb>
owing to rats, and shut it in anguish of spirit; for time and<lb>
space were not to be had, and chaos reigned along with the<lb>
rats. Our chimney-piece was decorated with a flat-iron, a<lb>
Bible, a candle minus stick, a lavender bottle, a new tin pan,<lb>
so brilliant that it served nicely for a pier-glass, and such of<lb>
the portly black bugs as preferred a warmer climate than the<lb>
rubbish hole afforded. Two arks, commonly called trunks,<lb>
lurked behind the door, containing the worldly goods of the<lb>
twain who laughed and cried, slept and scrambled, in this<lb>
refuge; while from the white-washed walls above either bed,<lb>
looked down the pictured faces of those whose memory can<lb>
make for us&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;One little room an everywhere.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>For a day or two I managed to appear at meals; for the<lb>
human grub must eat till the butterfly is ready to break loose,<lb>
and no one had time to come up two flights while it was<lb>
possible for me to come down. Far be it from me to add<lb>
another affliction or reproach to that enduring man, the steward;<lb>
for, compared with his predecessor, he was a horn of<lb>
plenty; but &mdash; I put it to any candid mind &mdash; is not the<lb>
<pb n="069">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-074">

<figdesc>Page 069.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
following bill of fare susceptible of improvement, without<lb>
plunging the nation madly into debt? The three meals were<lb>
&ldquo;pretty much of a muchness,&rdquo; and consisted of beef, evidently<lb>
put down for the men of '76; pork, just in from the street;<lb>
army bread, composed of saw-dust and saleratus; butter, salt<lb>
as if churned by Lot's wife; stewed blackberries, so much<lb>
like preserved cockroaches, that only those devoid of imagination<lb>
could partake thereof with relish; coffee, mild and<lb>
muddy; tea, three dried huckleberry leaves to a quart of<lb>
water &mdash; flavored with lime &mdash; also animated and unconscious of<lb>
any approach to clearness. Variety being the spice of life, a<lb>
small pinch of the article would have been appreciated by the<lb>
hungry, hard-working sisterhood, one of whom, though accustomed<lb>
to plain fare, soon found herself reduced to bread and<lb>
water; having an inborn repugnance to the fat of the land,<lb>
and the salt of the earth.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of these hospital meals was the rapidity<lb>
with which the edibles vanished, and the impossibility of getting<lb>
a drop or crumb after the usual time. At the first ring of the<lb>
bell, a general stampede took place; some twenty hungry<lb>
souls rushed to the dining-room, swept over the table like a<lb>
swarm of locusts, and left no fragment for any tardy creature<lb>
who arrived fifteen minutes late. Thinking it of more importance<lb>
that the patients should be well and comfortably fed, I<lb>
took my time about my own meals for the first day or two<lb>
after I came, but was speedily enlightened by Isaac, the black<lb>
waiter, who bore with me a few times, and then informed me,<lb>
looking as stern as fate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, mam, ef you comes so late you can't have no<lb>
vittles, &mdash; 'cause I'm 'bleeged fer ter git things ready fer de<lb>
doctors 'mazin' spry arter you nusses and folks is done. De<lb>
gen'lemen don't kere fer ter wait, no more does I; so you<lb>
<pb n="070">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-075">

<figdesc>Page 070.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
jes' please ter come at de time, and dere won't be no frettin'<lb>
nowheres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a new sensation to stand looking at a full table,<lb>
painfully conscious of one of the vacuums which Nature<lb>
abhors, and receive orders to right about face, without<lb>
partaking of the nourishment which your inner woman clamorously<lb>
demanded. The doctors always fared better than we;<lb>
and for a moment a desperate impulse prompted me to give<lb>
them a hint, by walking off with the mutton, or confiscating<lb>
the pie. But Ike's eye was on me, and, to my shame be it<lb>
spoken, I walked meekly away; went dinnerless that day,<lb>
and that evening went to market, laying in a small stock of<lb>
crackers, cheese and apples, that my boys might not be<lb>
neglected, nor myself obliged to bolt solid and liquid dyspep-sias,<lb>
or starve. This plan would have succeeded admirably<lb>
had not the evil star under which I was born, been in the<lb>
ascendant during that month, and cast its malign influences<lb>
even into my &ldquo;'umble&rdquo; larder; for the rats had their dessert<lb>
off my cheese, the bugs set up housekeeping in my crackerbag,<lb>
and the apples like all wordly riches, took to themselves<lb>
wings and flew away; whither no man could tell, though<lb>
certain black imps might have thrown light upon the matter,<lb>
had not the plaintiff in the case been loth to add another to<lb>
the many trials of long-suffering Africa. After this failure I<lb>
resigned myself to fate, and, remembering that bread was called<lb>
the staff of life, leaned pretty exclusively upon it; but it<lb>
proved a broken reed, and I came to the ground after a few<lb>
weeks of prison fare, varied by an occasional potato or surreptitious<lb>
sip of milk.</p>
<p>Very soon after leaving the care of my ward, I discovered<lb>
that I had no appetite, and cut the bread and butter interests<lb>
almost entirely, trying the exercise and sun cure instead.<lb>
<pb n="071">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-076">

<figdesc>Page 071.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Flattering myself that I had plenty of time, and could see all<lb>
that was to be seen, so far as a lone lorn female could venture<lb>
in a city, one-half of whose male population seemed to be<lb>
taking the other half to the guard-house, &mdash; every morning I<lb>
took a brisk run in one direction or another; for the January<lb>
days were as mild as Spring. A rollicking north wind and<lb>
occasional snow storm would have been more to my taste, for<lb>
the one would have braced and refreshed tired body and soul,<lb>
the other have purified the air, and spread a clean coverlid<lb>
over the bed, wherein the capital of these United States<lb>
appeared to be dozing pretty soundly just then.</p>
<p>One of these trips was to the Armory Hospital, the neatness,<lb>
comfort, and convenience of which makes it an honor to its<lb>
presiding genius, and arouses all the covetous propensities of<lb>
such nurses as came from other hospitals to visit it.</p>
<p>The long, clean, warm, and airy wards, built barrack-fashion,<lb>
with the nurse's room at the end, were fully appreciated by<lb>
Nurse Periwinkle, whose ward and private bower were cold,<lb>
dirty, inconvenient, up stairs and down stairs, and in everybody's<lb>
chamber. At the Armory, in ward K, I found a<lb>
cheery, bright-eyed, white-aproned little lady, reading at her<lb>
post near the stove; matting under her feet; a draft of fresh<lb>
air flowing in above her head; a table full of trays, glasses,<lb>
and such matters, on one side, a large, well-stocked medicine<lb>
chest on the other; and all her duty seemed to be going about<lb>
now and then to give doses, issue orders, which well-trained<lb>
attendants executed, and pet, advise, or comfort Tom, Dick,<lb>
or Harry, as she found best. As I watched the proceedings,<lb>
I recalled my own tribulations, and contrasted the two hospitals<lb>
in a way that would have caused my summary dismissal, could<lb>
it have been reported at headquarters. Here, order, method,<lb>
common sense and liberality reigned and ruled, in a style<lb>
<pb n="072">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-077">

<figdesc>Page 072.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
that did one's heart good to see; at the Hurly burly Hotel,<lb>
disorder, discomfort, bad management, and no visible head,<lb>
reduced things to a condition which I despair of describing.<lb>
The circumlocution fashion prevailed, forms and fusses tormented<lb>
our souls, and unnecessary strictness in one place was<lb>
counterbalanced by unpardonable laxity in another. Here is<lb>
a sample: I am dressing Sam Dammer's shoulder; and, having<lb>
cleansed the wound, look about for some strips of adhesive<lb>
plaster to hold on the little square of wet linen which is to<lb>
cover the gunshot wound; the case is not in the tray; Frank,<lb>
the sleepy, half-sick attendant, knows nothing of it; we<lb>
rummage high and low; Sam is tired, and fumes; Frank<lb>
dawdles and yawns; the men advise and laugh at the flurry;<lb>
I feel like a boiling tea-kettle, with the lid ready to fly off and<lb>
damage somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and borrow some from the next ward, and spend the<lb>
rest of the day in finding ours,&rdquo; I finally command. A pause;<lb>
then Frank scuffles back with the message: &ldquo;Miss Peppercorn<lb>
ain't got none, and says you ain't no business to lose your own<lb>
duds and go borrowin' other folkses.&rdquo; I say nothing, for fear<lb>
of saying too much, but fly to the surgery. Mr. Toddypestle<lb>
informs me that I can't have anything without an order from<lb>
the surgeon of my ward. Great heavens! where is he? and<lb>
away I rush, up and down, here and there, till at last I find<lb>
him, in a state of bliss over a complicated amputation, in the<lb>
fourth story. I make my demand; he answers: &ldquo;In five<lb>
minutes,&rdquo; and works away, with his head upside down, as he<lb>
ties an artery, saws a bone, or does a little needle-work, with<lb>
a visible relish and very sanguinary pair of hands. The five<lb>
minutes grow to fifteen, and Frank appears, with the remark<lb>
that, &ldquo;Dammer wants to know what in thunder you are<lb>
keeping him there with his finger on a wet rag for?&rdquo; Dr. P.<lb>
<pb n="073">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-078">

<figdesc>Page 073.</figdesc>

tears himself away long enough to scribble the order, with<lb>
which I plunge downward to the surgery again, find the door<lb>
locked, and, while hammering away on it, am told that two<lb>
friends are waiting to see me in the hall. The matron being<lb>
away, her parlor is locked, and there is no where to see my<lb>
guests but in my own room, and no time to enjoy them till<lb>
the plaster is found. I settle this matter, and circulate through<lb>
the house to find Toddypestle, who has no right to leave the<lb>
surgery till night. He is discovered in the dead house, smoking<lb>
a eigar, and very much the worse for his researches among the<lb>
spirituous preparations that fill the surgery shelves. He is<lb>
inclined to be gallant, and puts the finishing blow to the fire<lb>
of my wrath; for the tea-kettle lid flies off, and driving him<lb>
before me to his post, I fling down the order, take what I<lb>
choose; and, leaving the absurd incapable kissing his hand to<lb>
me, depart, feeling as Grandma Riglesty is reported to have<lb>
done, when she vainly sought for chips, in Bimleck Jackwood's<lb>
&ldquo;shifless paster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find Dammer a well acted charade of his own name, and,<lb>
just as I get him done, struggling the while with a burning<lb>
desire to clap an adhesive strip across his mouth, full of<lb>
heaven-defying oaths, Frank takes up his boot to put it on,<lb>
and exclaims:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm blest ef here ain't that case now! I recollect seeing<lb>
it pitch in this mornin', but forgot all about it, till my heel<lb>
went smash inter it. Here, ma'am, ketch hold on it, and give<lb>
the boys a sheet on't all round, 'gainst it tumbles inter t'other<lb>
boot next time yer want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a look could annihilate, Francis Saucebox would have<lb>
ceased to exist, but it couldn't; therefore, he yet lives, to<lb>
aggravate some unhappy woman's soul, and wax fat in some<lb>
equally congenial situation.</p>

<p>Now, while I'm freeing my mind, I should like to enter my<lb>
protest against employing convalescents as attendants, instead<lb>
of strong, properly trained, and cheerful men. How it may<lb>
be in other places I cannot say; but here it was a source of<lb>
constant trouble and confusion, these feeble, ignorant men<lb>
trying to sweep, scrub, lift, and wait upon their sicker comrades.<lb>
One, with a diseased heart, was expected to run up and down<lb>
stairs, carry heavy trays, and move helpless men; he tried it,<lb>
and grew rapidly worse than when he first came: and, when<lb>
he was ordered out to march away to the convalescent hospital,<lb>
fell, in a sort of fit, before he turned the corner, and was<lb>
brought back to die. Another, hurt by a fall from his horse,<lb>
endeavored to do his duty, but failed entirely, and the wrath<lb>
of the ward master fell upon the nurse, who must either scrub<lb>
the rooms herself, or take the lecture; for the boy looked stout<lb>
and well, and the master never happened to see him turn<lb>
white with pain, or hear him groan in his sleep when an invol<lb>
untary motion strained his poor back. Constant complaints<lb>
were being made of incompetent attendants, and some dozen<lb>
women did double duty, and then were blamed for breaking<lb>
down. If any hospital director fancies this a good and<lb>
economical arrangement, allow one used up nurse to tell him<lb>
it isn't, and beg him to spare the sisterhood, who sometimes,<lb>
in their sympathy, forget that they are mortal, and run the<lb>
risk of being made immortal, sooner than is agreeable to their<lb>
partial friends.</p>
<p>Another of my few rambles took me to the Senate Chamber,<lb>
hoping to hear and see if this large machine was run any<lb>
better than some small ones I knew of. I was too late, and<lb>
found the Speaker's chair occupied by a colored gentleman of<lb>
ten; while two others were &ldquo;on their legs,&rdquo; having a hot<lb>
debate on the cornball question, as they gathered the waste<lb>
<pb n="075">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-080">

<figdesc>Page 075.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="F">
paper strewn about the floor into bags; and several white<lb>
members played leap-frog over the desks, a much wholesomer<lb>
relaxation than some of the older Senators indulge in, I fancy.<lb>
Finding the coast clear, I likewise gambolled up and down,<lb>
from gallery to gallery; sat in Summer's chair, and cudgelled<lb>
an imaginary Brooks within an inch of his life; examined<lb>
Wilson's books in the coolest possible manner; warmed my<lb>
feet at one of the national registers; read people's names on<lb>
scattered envelopes, and pocketed a castaway autograph or<lb>
two; watched the somewhat unparliamentary proceedings<lb>
going on about me, and wondered who in the world all the<lb>
sedate gentlemen were, who kept popping out of odd doors<lb>
here and there, like respectable Jacks-in-the-box. Then I<lb>
wandered over the &ldquo;palatial residence&rdquo; of Mrs. Columbia,<lb>
and examined its many beauties, though I can't say I thought<lb>
her a tidy housekeeper, and didn't admire her taste in pictures;<lb>
for the eye of this humble individual soon wearied of expiring<lb>
patriots, who all appeared to be quitting their earthly tabernacles<lb>
in convulsions, ruffled shirts, and a whirl of torn banners,<lb>
bomb shells, and buff and blue arms and legs. The statuary<lb>
also was massive and concrete, but rather wearying to examine;<lb>
for the colossal ladies and gentlemen, carried no cards of<lb>
introduction in face or figure; so, whether the meditative party<lb>
in a kilt, with well-developed legs, shoes like army slippers,<lb>
and a ponderous nose, was Columbus, Cato, or Cockelorum<lb>
Tibby, the tragedian, was more than I could tell. Several<lb>
robust ladies attracted me, as I felt particularly &ldquo;wimbly&rdquo;<lb>
myself, as old country women say; but which was America<lb>
and which Pocahontas was a mystery, for all affected much<lb>
looseness of costume, dishevelment of hair, swords, arrows,<lb>
lances, scales, and other ornaments quite <hi rend="italics">pass&eacute;</hi> with damsels<lb>
of our day, whose effigies should go down to posterity armed<lb>

<figdesc>Page 076.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with fans, crochet needles, riding whips, and parasols, with<lb>
here and there one holding pen or pencil, rolling-pin or broom.<lb>
The statue of Liberty I recognized at once, for it had no<lb>
pedestal as yet, but stood flat in the mud, with Young America<lb>
most symbollically making dirt pies, and chip forts, in its<lb>
shadow. But high above the squabbling little throng and<lb>
their petty plans, the sun shone full on Liberty's broad<lb>
forehead, and, in her hand, some summer bird had built its<lb>
nest. I accepted the good omen then, and, on the first of<lb>
January, the Emancipation Act gave the statue a nobler and<lb>
more enduring pedestal than any marble or granite ever carved<lb>
and quarried by human hands.</p>
<p>One trip to Georgetown Heights, where cedars sighed overhead,<lb>
dead leaves rustled underfoot, pleasant paths led up and<lb>
down, and a brook wound like a silver snake by the blackened<lb>
ruins of some French Minister's house, through the poor<lb>
gardens of the black washerwomen who congregated there,<lb>
and, passing the cemetery with a murmurous lullaby, rolled<lb>
away to pay its little tribute to the river. This breezy run<lb>
was the last I took; for, on the morrow, came rain and wind:<lb>
and confinement soon proved a powerful reinforcement to the<lb>
enemy, who was quietly preparing to spring a mine, and blow<lb>
me five hundred miles from the position I had taken in what I<lb>
called my Chickahominy Swamp.</p>
<p>Shut up in my room, with no voice, spirits, or books, that<lb>
week was not a hoilday, by any means. Finding meals a<lb>
humbug, I stopped away altogether, trusting that if this sparrow<lb>
was of any worth, the Lord would not let it fall to the ground.<lb>
Like a flock of friendly ravens, my sister nurses fed me, not<lb>
only with food for the body, but kind words for the mind;<lb>
and soon, from being half starved, I found myself so beteaed<lb>
and betoasted, petted and served, that I was quite &ldquo;in the lap<lb>
<pb n="077">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-082">

<figdesc>Page 077.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of luxury,&rdquo; in spite of cough, headache, a painful consciousness<lb>
of my pleura, and a realizing sense of bones in the human<lb>
frame. From the pleasant house on the hill, the home in the<lb>
heart of Washington, and the Willard caravansary, came<lb>
friends new and old, with bottles, baskets, carriages and invitations<lb>
for the invalid; and daily our Florence Nightingale<lb>
climbed the steep stairs, stealing a moment from her busy life,<lb>
to watch over the stranger, of whom she was as thoughtfully<lb>
tender as any mother. Long may she wave! Whatever others<lb>
may think or say, Nurse Periwinkle is forever grateful; and<lb>
among her relics of that Washington defeat, none is more<lb>
valued than the little book which appeared on her pillow, one<lb>
dreary day; for the D. D. written in it means to her far more<lb>
than Doctor of Divinity.</p>
<p>Being forbidden to meddle with fleshly arms and legs, I<lb>
solaced myself by mending cotton ones, and, as I sat sewing<lb>
at my window, watched the moving panorama that passed<lb>
below; amusing myself with taking notes of the most striking<lb>
figures in it. Long trains of army wagons kept up a perpetual<lb>
rumble from morning till night; ambulances rattled to and fro<lb>
with busy surgeons, nurses taking an airing, or convalescents<lb>
going in parties to be fitted to artificial limbs. Strings of sorry<lb>
looking horses passed, saying as plainly as dumb creatures<lb>
could, &ldquo;Why, in a city full of them, is there no <hi rend="italics">horse</hi>pital<lb>
for us?&rdquo; Often a cart came by, with several rough coffins in<lb>
it, and no mourners following; barouches, with invalid officers,<lb>
rolled round the corner, and carriage loads of pretty children,<lb>
with black coachmen, footmen, and maids. The women who<lb>
took their walks abroad, were so extinguished in three story<lb>
bonnets, with overhanging balconies of flowers, that their<lb>
charms were obseured; and all I can say of them is, that they<lb>
dressed in the worst possible taste, and walked like ducks.</p>
<pb n="078">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-083">

<figdesc>Page 078.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The men did the picturesque, and did it so well that Washington<lb>
looked like a mammoth masquerade. Spanish hats,<lb>
scarlet lined riding cloaks, swords and sashes, high boots and<lb>
bright spurs, beards and mustaches, which made plain faces<lb>
comely, and comely faces heroic; these vanities of the flesh<lb>
transformed our butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers into<lb>
gallant riders of gaily caparisoaed horses, much handsomer<lb>
than themselves; and dozens of such figures were constantly<lb>
prancing by, with private prickings of spurs, for the benefit<lb>
of the perambulating flower-bed. Some of these gentlemen<lb>
affected painfully tight uniforms, and little caps, kept on by<lb>
some new law of gravitation, as they covered only the bridge<lb>
of the nose, yet never fell off; the men looked like stuffed<lb>
fowls, and rode as if the safety of the nation depended on<lb>
their speed alone. The fattest, greyest officers dressed most,<lb>
and ambled statelily along, with orderlies behind, trying to<lb>
look as if they didn't know the stout party in front, and doing<lb>
much caracoling on their own account.</p>
<p>The mules were my especial delight; and an hour's study<lb>
of a constant succession of them introduced me to many of<lb>
their characteristics; for six of these odd little beasts drew<lb>
each army wagon, and went hopping like frogs through the<lb>
stream of mud that gently rolled along the street. The<lb>
coquettish mule had small feet, a nicely trimmed tassel of a<lb>
tail, perked up ears, and seemed much given to little tosses of<lb>
the head, affected skips and prances; and, if he wore the<lb>
bells, or were bedizzened with a bit of finery, put on as many<lb>
airs as any belle. The moral mule was a stout, hard-working<lb>
creature, always tugging with all his might; often pulling<lb>
away after the rest had stopped, laboring under the conscientious<lb>
delusion that food for the entire army depended upon his<lb>
private exertions. I respected this style of mule; and, had<lb>
<pb n="079">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-084">

<figdesc>Page 079.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
I possessed a juicy cabbage, would have pressed it upon him,<lb>
with thanks for his excellent example. The historical mule<lb>
was a melo-dramatic quadruped, prone to startling humanity<lb>
by erratic leaps, and wild plunges, much shaking of his<lb>
stubborn head, and lashing out of his vicious heels; now and<lb>
then falling flat, and apparently dying <hi rend="italics">a la</hi> Forrest: a gasp&mdash;<lb>
a squirm&mdash;a flop, and so on, till the street was well blocked<lb>
up, the drivers all swearing like demons in bad hats, and the<lb>
chief actor's circulation decidedly quickened by every variety<lb>
of kick, cuff, jerk and haul. When the last breath seemed to<lb>
have left his body, and &ldquo;Doctors were in vain,&rdquo; a sudden<lb>
resurrection took place; and if ever a mule laughed with<lb>
scornful triumph, that was the beast, as he leisurely rose, gave<lb>
a comfortable shake; and, calmly regarding the excited crowd<lb>
seemed to say&mdash;&ldquo;A hit! a decided hit! for the stupidest<lb>
of animals has bamboozled a dozen men. Now, then! what<lb>
are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> stopping the way for?&rdquo; The pathetic mule was,<lb>
perhaps, the most interesting of all; for, though he always<lb>
seemed to be the smallest, thinnest, weakest of the six, the<lb>
postillion, with big boots, long-tailed coat, and heavy whip,<lb>
was sure to bestride this one, who struggled feebly along, head<lb>
down, coat muddy and rough, eye spiritless and sad, his very<lb>
tail a mortified stump, and the whole beast a picture of meek<lb>
misery, fit to touch a heart of stone. The jovial mule was a<lb>
roly poly, happy-go-lucky little piece of horse-flesh, taking<lb>
everything easily, from cudgeling to caressing; strolling along<lb>
with a roguish twinkle of the eye, and, if the thing were<lb>
possible, would have had his hands in his pockets, and whistled<lb>
as he went. If there ever chanced to be an apple core, a<lb>
stray turnip, or wisp of hay, in the gutter, this Mark Tapley<lb>
was sure to find it, and none of his mates seemed to begrudge<lb>
him his bite. I suspected this fellow was the peacemaker,<lb>
<pb n="080">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-085">

<figdesc>Page 080.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
confidant and friend of all the others, for he had a sort of<lb>
&ldquo;Cheer-up,-old-boy,-I'll-pull-you-through&rdquo; look, which was<lb>
exceedingly engaging.</p>
<p>Pigs also possessed attractions for me, never having had<lb>
an opportunity of observing their graces of mind and manner,<lb>
till I came to Washington, whose porcine citizens appeared to<lb>
enjoy a larger liberty than many of its human ones. Stout,<lb>
sedate looking pigs, hurried by each morning to their places<lb>
of business, with a preoccupied air, and sonorous greeting to<lb>
their friends. Genteel pigs, with an extra curl to their tails,<lb>
promenaded in pairs, lunching here and there, like gentlemen<lb>
of leisure. Rowdy pigs pushed the passers by off the side<lb>
walk; tipsy pigs hiccoughed their version of &ldquo;We wont go<lb>
home till morning,&rdquo; from the gutter; and delicate young pigs<lb>
tripped daintily through the mud, as if, like &ldquo;Mrs. Peerybingle,&rdquo;<lb>
they plumed themselves upon their ankles, and kept<lb>
themselves particularly neat in point of stockings. Maternal<lb>
pigs, with their interesting families, strolled by in the sun;<lb>
and often the pink, baby-like squealers lay down for a nap,<lb>
with a trust in Providence worthy of human imitation.</p>
<p>But more interesting than officers, ladies, mules, or pigs,<lb>
were my colored brothers and sisters, because so unlike the<lb>
respectable members of society I'd known in moral Boston.</p>
<p>Here was the genuine article&mdash;no, not the genuine article<lb>
at all, we must go to Africa for that&mdash;but the sort of creatures<lb>
generations of slavery have made them: obsequious, trickish,<lb>
lazy and ignorant, yet kind-hearted, merry-tempered, quick to<lb>
feel and accept the least token of the brotherly love which is<lb>
slowly teaching the white hand to grasp the black, in this<lb>
great struggle for the liberty of both the races.</p>
<p>Having been warned not to be too rampant on the subject<lb>
of slavery, as secesh principles flourished even under the<lb>

respectable nose of Father Abraham, I had endeavored to<lb>
walk discreetly, and curb my unruly member; looking about<lb>
me with all my eyes, the while, and saving up the result of<lb>
my observations for future use. I had not been there a week,<lb>
before the neglected, devil-may care expression in many of<lb>
the faces about me, seemed an urgent appeal to leave nursing<lb>
white bodies, and take some care for these black souls. Much<lb>
as the lazy boys and saucy girls tormented me, I liked them,<lb>
and found that any show of interest of friendliness brought<lb>
out the better traits which live in the most degraded and<lb>
forsaken of us all. I liked their cheerfulness, for the dreariest<lb>
old hag, who scrubbed all day in that pestilential steam,<lb>
gossipped and grinned all the way out, when night set her free<lb>
from drudgery. The girls romped with their dusky sweethearts,<lb>
or tossed their babies, with the tender pride that makes<lb>
mother-love a beautifier to the homeliest face. The men and<lb>
boys sang and whistled all day long; and often. as I held my<lb>
watch, the silence of the night was sweetly broken by some<lb>
chorus from the street, full of real melody, whether the song<lb>
was of heaven, or of hoe-cakes; and, as I listened, I felt that<lb>
we never should doubt nor despair concerning a race which,<lb>
through such griefs and wrongs, still clings to this good gift,<lb>
and seems to solace with it the patient hearts that wait and<lb>
watch and hope until the end.</p>
<p>I expected to have to defend myself from accusations of a<lb>
prejudice against color; but was surprised to find things just<lb>
the other way, and daily shocked some neighbor by treating<lb>
the blacks as I did the whites. The men <hi rend="italics">would</hi> swear at the<lb>
&ldquo;darkies,&rdquo; would put two <hi rend="italics">gs</hi> into negro, and scoff at the idea<lb>
of any good coming from such trash. The nurses were willing<lb>
to be served by the colored people, but seldom thanked them,<lb>
never praised, and scarcely recognized them in the street;<lb>
<pb n="082">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-087">

<figdesc>Page 082.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
whereat the blood of two generations of abolitionists waxed<lb>
hot in my veins, and, at the first opportunity, proclaimed itself,<lb>
and asserted the right of free speech as doggedly as the irrepressible<lb>
Folsom herself.</p>
<p>Happening to catch up a funny little black baby, who was<lb>
toddling about the nurses' kitchen, one day, when I went<lb>
down to make a mess for some of my men, a Virginia woman<lb>
standing by elevated her most prominent features, with a sniff<lb>
of disapprobation, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Miss P.! how can you? I've been here six<lb>
months, and never so much as touched the little toad with a<lb>
poker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More shame for you, ma'am,&rdquo; responded Miss P.; and,<lb>
with the natural perversity of a Yankee, followed up the blow<lb>
by kissing &ldquo;the toad,&rdquo; with ardor. His face was providentially<lb>
as clean and shiny as if his mamma had just polished it<lb>
up with a corner of her apron and a drop from the tea-kettle<lb>
spout, like old Aunt Chole. This rash act, and the antislavery<lb>
lecture that followed, while one band stirred gruel for<lb>
sick America, and the other hugged baby Africa, did not<lb>
produce the cheering result which I fondly expected; for my<lb>
comrade henceforth regarded me as a dangerous fanatic, and<lb>
my proteg&eacute; nearly came to his death by insisting on swarming<lb>
up stairs to my room, on all occasions, and being walked on<lb>
like a little black spider.</p>
<p>I waited for New Year's day with more eagerness than I<lb>
had ever known before; and, though it brought me no gift, I<lb>
felt rich in the act of justice so tardily performed toward some<lb>
of those about me. As the bells rung midnight, I electrified<lb>
my room-mate by dancing out of bed, throwing up the<lb>
window, and flapping my handkerchief, with a feeble cheer,<lb>
in answer to the shout of a group of colored men in the street<lb>
<pb n="083">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-088">

<figdesc>Page 083.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
below. All night they tooted and tramped, fired crackers,<lb>
sung &ldquo;Glory, Hallelujah,&rdquo; and took comfort, poor souls! in<lb>
their own way. The sky was clear, the moon shone benignly,<lb>
a mild wind blew across the river, and all good omens seemed<lb>
to usher in the dawn of the day whose noontide cannot now<lb>
be long in coming. If the colored people had taken hands<lb>
and danced around the White House, with a few cheers for<lb>
the much abused gentleman who has immortalized himself by<lb>
one just act, no President could have had a finer levee, or one<lb>
to be prouder of.</p>
<p>While these sights and sounds were going on without,<lb>
curious scenes were passing within, and I was learning that<lb>
one of the best methods of fitting oneself to be a nurse in a<lb>
hospital, is to be a patient there; for then only can one wholly<lb>
realize what the men suffer and sigh for; how acts of kindness<lb>
touch and win; how much or little we are to those about us;<lb>
and for the first time really see that in coming there we have<lb>
taken our lives in our hands, and may have to pay dearly for<lb>
a brief experience. Every one was very kind; the attendants<lb>
of my ward often came up to report progress, to fill my woodbox,<lb>
or bring messages and presents from my boys. The<lb>
nurses took many steps with those tired feet of theirs, and<lb>
several came each evening, to chat over my fire and make<lb>
things cosy for the night. The doctors paid daily visits,<lb>
tapped at my lungs to see if pneumonia was within, left doses<lb>
without names, and went away, leaving mo as ignorant, and<lb>
much more uncomfortable than when they came. Hours<lb>
began to get confused; people looked odd; queer faces haunted<lb>
the room, and the nights were one long fight with weariness<lb>
and pain. Letters from home grew anxious; the doctors<lb>
lifted their eyebrows, and nodded ominously; friends said<lb>
&ldquo;Don't stay,&rdquo; and an internal rebellion seconded the advice;<lb>
<pb n="084"><target id="p441-089">p441-089</target>
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-089">

</eaffig>
but the three months were not out, and the idea of giving<lb>
up so soon was proclaiming a defeat before I was fairly routed;<lb>
so to all &ldquo;Don't stays&rdquo; I opposed &ldquo;I wills,&rdquo; till, one fine<lb>
morning, a grey-headed gentlemen rose like a welcome ghost<lb>
on my hearth; and, at the sight of him, my resolution melted<lb>
away, my heart turned traitor to my boys, and, when he said,<lb>
&ldquo;Come home,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Yes, father;&rdquo; and so ended<lb>
my career as an army nurse.</p>
<p>I never shall regret the going, though a sharp tussle with<lb>
typhoid, ten dollars, and a wig, are all the visible results of<lb>
the experiment; for one may live and learn much in a month.<lb>
A good fit of illness proves the value of health; real danger<lb>
tries one's mettle; and self-sacrifice sweetens character. Let<lb>
no one who sincerely desires to help the work on in this way,<lb>
delay going through any fear; for the worth of life lies in the<lb>
experiences that fill it, and this is one which cannot be forgotten.<lb>
All that is best and bravest in the hearts of men and women,<lb>
comes out in scenes like these; and, though a hospital is a<lb>
rough school, its lessons are both stern and salutary; and the<lb>
humblest of pupils there, in proportion to his faithfulness,<lb>
learns a deeper faith in God and in himself. I, for one,<lb>
would return tomorrow, on the &ldquo;up-again,-and-take-another&rdquo;<lb>
principle, if I could; for the amount of pleasure and profit I<lb>
got out of that month compensates for all after pangs; and,<lb>
though a sadly womanish feeling, I take some satisfaction in<lb>
the thought that, if I could not lay my head on the altar of<lb>
my country, I have my hair; and that is more than handsome<lb>
Helen did for her dead husband, when she sacrificed only the<lb>
ends of her ringlets on his urn. Therefore, I close this little<lb>
chapter of hospital experiences, with the regret that they were<lb>
no better worth recording; and add the poetical gem with<lb>

answer them <hi rend="italics">en masse,</hi> and in printed form, as a sort of<lb>
postscript to what has gone before. One of these questions<lb>
was, &ldquo;Are there no services by hospital death-beds, or on<lb>
Sundays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In most Hospitals I hope there are; in ours, the men died,<lb>
and were carried away, with as little ceremony as on a battlefield.<lb>
The first event of this kind which I witnessed was so<lb>
very brief, and bare of anything like reverence, sorrow, or<lb>
pious consolation, that I heartily agreed with the bluntly<lb>
expressed opinion of a Maine man lying next his comrade,<lb>
who died with no visible help near him, but a compassionate<lb>
woman and a tender hearted Irishman, who dropped upon his<lb>
knees, and told his beads, with Catholic fervor, for the good<lb>
of his Protestant brother's parting soul:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, after gettin' all the hard knocks, we are left to die<lb>
<pb n="087">

</eaffig>
this way, with nothing but a Paddy's prayers to help us, I<lb>
guess Christians are rather scarce round Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought so too; but though Miss Blank, one of my<lb>
mates, auxious that souls should be ministered to, as well as<lb>
bodies, spoke more than once to the Chaplain, nothing ever<lb>
came of it. Unlike another Shepherd, whose earnest piety<lb>
weekly purified the Senate Chamber, this man did not feed as<lb>
well as fold his flock, nor make himself a human symbol of the<lb>
Divine Samaritan, who never passes by on the other side.</p>
<p>I have since learned that our non-commital Chaplain had<lb>
been a Professor, in some Southern College; and, though he<lb>
maintained that he had no secesh proclivities, I can testify<lb>
that he seceded from his ministerial duties, I may say, skedaddled;<lb>
for, being one of his own words, it is as appropriate<lb>
as inelegant. He read Emerson, quoted Carlyle, and tried to<lb>
be a Chaplain; but, judging from his success, I am afraid he<lb>
still hankered after the hominy pots of Rebeldom.</p>
<p>Occasionally, on a Sunday afternoon, such of the nurses,<lb>
officers, attendants, and patients as could avail themselves of<lb>
it, were gathered in the Ball Room, for an hour's service, of<lb>
which the singing was the better part. To me it seemed that<lb>
if ever strong, wise, and loving words were needed, it was<lb>
then; if ever mortal man had living texts before his eyes to<lb>
illustrate and illuminate his thought, it was there; and if ever<lb>
hearts were prompted to devoutest self-abnegation, it was in<lb>
the work which brought us to anything but a Chapel of Ease.<lb>
But some spiritual paralysis seemed to have befallen our<lb>
pastor; for, though many faces turned toward him, full of the<lb>
dumb hunger that often comes to men when suffering or danger<lb>
brings them nearer to the heart of things, they were offered<lb>
the chaff of divinity, and its wheat was left for less needy<lb>
gleaners, who knew where to look. Even the fine old Bible<lb>
<pb n="088">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-093">

<figdesc>Page 088.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stories, which may be made as lifelike as any history of our<lb>
day, by a vivid fancy and pictorial diction, were robbed of all<lb>
their charms by dry explanations and literal applications,<lb>
instead of being useful and pleasant lessons to those men,<lb>
whom weakness had rendered as docile as children in a father's<lb>
hands.</p>
<p>I watched the listless countenances all about me, while a<lb>
mild Daniel was moralizing in a den of utterly uninteresting<lb>
lions; while Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego were leisurely<lb>
passing through the fiery furnace, where, I sadly feared, some<lb>
of us sincerely wished they had remained as permanencies;<lb>
while the Temple of Solomon was laboriously erected, with<lb>
minute descriptions of the process, and any quantity of bells<lb>
and pomegranates on the raiment of the priests. Listless they<lb>
were at the beginning, and listless at the end; but the instant<lb>
some stirring old hymn was given out, sleepy eyes brightened,<lb>
lounging figures sat erect, and many a poor lad rose up in his<lb>
bed, or stretched an eager hand for the book, while all broke<lb>
out with a heartiness that proved that somewhere at the core<lb>
of even the most abandoned, there still glowed some remnant<lb>
of the native piety that flows in music from the heart of every<lb>
little child. Even the big rebel joined, and boomed away in<lb>
a thunderous bass, singing &mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;Salvation! let the echoes fly,&rdquo;</p></q>
as energetically as if he felt the need of a speedy execution<lb>
of the command.</p>
<p>That was the pleasantest moment of the hour, for then it<lb>
seemed a homelike and happy spot; the groups of men looking<lb>
over one another's shoulders as they sang; the few silent<lb>
figures in the beds; here and there a woman noiselessly performing<lb>
some necessary duty, and singing as she worked;<lb>
<pb n="089">

</eaffig>
while in the arm chair standing in the midst, I placed, for my<lb>
own satisfaction, the imaginary likeness of a certain faithful<lb>
pastor, who took all outcasts by the hand, smote the devil in<lb>
whatever guise he came, and comforted the indigent in spirit<lb>
with the best wisdom of a great and tender heart, which still<lb>
speaks to us from its Italian grave. With that addition, my<lb>
picture was complete; and I often longed to take a veritable<lb>
sketch of a Hospital Sunday, for, despite its drawbacks,<lb>
consisting of continued labor, the want of proper books, the<lb>
barren preaching that bore no fruit, this day was never like<lb>
the other six.</p>
<p>True to their home training, our New England boys did<lb>
their best to make it what it should be. With many, there<lb>
was much reading of Testaments, humming over of favorite<lb>
hymns, and looking at such books as I could cull from a<lb>
miscellaneous library. Some lay idle, slept, or gossiped; yet,<lb>
when I came to them for a quiet evening chat, they often<lb>
talked freely and well of themselves; would blunder out some<lb>
timid hope that their troubles might &ldquo;do 'em good, and keep'<lb>
em stiddy;&rdquo; would choke a little, as they said good night,<lb>
and turned their faces to the wall to think of mother, wife, or<lb>
home, these human ties seeming to be the most vital religion<lb>
which they yet knew. I observed that some of them did not<lb>
wear their caps on this day, though at other times they clung<lb>
to them like Quakers; wearing them in bed, putting them on<lb>
to read the paper, eat an apple, or write a letter, as if, like a<lb>
new sort of Samson, their strength lay, not in their hair, but in<lb>
their hats. Many read no novels, swore less, were more silent,<lb>
orderly, and cheerful, as if the Lord were an invisible Wardmaster,<lb>
who went his rounds but once a week, and must find<lb>
all things at their best. I liked all this in the poor, rough<lb>
boys, and could have found it in my heart to put down sponge<lb>
<pb n="090">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-095">

<figdesc>Page 090.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and tea-pot, and preach a little sermon then and there, while<lb>
homesickness and pain had made these natures soft, that some<lb>
good seed might be cast therein, to blossom and bear fruit<lb>
here or hereafter.</p>
<p>Regarding the admission of friends to nurse their sick, I<lb>
can only say, it was not allowed at Hurlyburly House; though<lb>
one indomitable parent took my ward by storm, and held her<lb>
position, in spite of doctors, matron, and Nurse Periwinkle.<lb>
Though it was against the rules, though the culprit was an<lb>
acid, frost bitten female, though the young man would have<lb>
done quite as well without her anxious fussiness, and the whole<lb>
room-full been much more comfortable, there was something so<lb>
irresistible in this persistent devotion, that no one had the<lb>
heart to oust her from her post. She slept on the floor, without<lb>
uttering a complaint; bore jokes somewhat of the rudest;<lb>
fared scantily, though her basket was daily filled with luxuries<lb>
for her boy; and tended that petulant personage with a neverfailing<lb>
patience beautiful to see.</p>
<p>I feel a glow of moral rectitude in saying this of her; for,<lb>
though a perfect pelican to her young, she pecked and cackled<lb>
(I don't know that pelicans usually express their emotions in<lb>
that manner,) most obsteperously, when others invaded her<lb>
premises; and led me a weary life, with &ldquo;George's tea-rusks,&rdquo;<lb>
&ldquo;George's foot-bath,&rdquo; &ldquo;George's measles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;George's<lb>
mother;&rdquo; till, after a sharp passage of arms and tongues with<lb>
the matron, she wrathfully packed up her rusks, her son, and<lb>
herself, and departed, in an ambulance, scolding to the very<lb>
last.</p>
<p>This is the comic side of the matter. The serious one is<lb>
harder to describe; for the presence, however brief, of relations<lb>
and friends by the bedsides of the dead or dying, is<lb>
always a trial to the bystanders. They are not near enough<lb>
<pb n="091">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-096">

<figdesc>Page 091.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="G">
to know how best to comfort, yet too near to turn their backs<lb>
upon the sorrow that finds its only solace in listening to<lb>
recitals of last words, breathed into nurse's ears, or receiving<lb>
the tender legacies of love and longing bequeathed through<lb>
them.</p>
<p>To me, the saddest sight I saw in that sad place, was the<lb>
spectacle of a grey-haired father, sitting hour after hour by<lb>
his son, dying from the poison of his wound. The old father,<lb>
hale and hearty; the young son, past all help, though one<lb>
could scarcely believe it; for the subtle fever, burning his<lb>
strength away, flushed his cheeks with color, filled his eyes<lb>
with lustre, and lent a mournful mockery of health to face and<lb>
figure, making the poor lad comelier in death than in life.<lb>
His bed was not in my ward; but I was often in and out,<lb>
and, for a day or two, the pair were much together, saying<lb>
little, but looking much. The old man tried to busy himself<lb>
with book or pen, that his presence might not be a burden;<lb>
and once, when he sat writing, to the anxious mother at home,<lb>
doubtless, I saw the son's eyes fixed upon his face, with a look<lb>
of mingled resignation and regret, as if endeavoring to teach<lb>
himself to say cheerfully the long good bye. And again,<lb>
when the son slept, the father watched him, as he had himself<lb>
been watched; and though no feature of his grave countenance<lb>
changed, the rough hand, smoothing the lock of hair<lb>
upon the pillow, the bowed attitude of the grey head, were<lb>
more pathetic than the loudest lamentations. The son died;<lb>
and the father took home the pale relie of the life he gave,<lb>
offering a little money to the nurse, as the only visible return<lb>
it was in his power to make her; for, though very grateful,<lb>
he was poor. Of course, she did not take it, but found a<lb>
richer compensation in the old man's earnest declaration:<lb>

<p>&ldquo;My boy couldn't have been better cared for if he'd been at<lb>
home; and God will reward you for it, though I can't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My own experiences of this sort began when my first man<lb>
died. He had scarcely been removed, when his wife came in.<lb>
Her eye went straight to the well-known bed; it was empty;<lb>
and feeling, yet not believing the hard truth, she cried out,<lb>
with a look I never shall forget:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where's Emanuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never seen her before, did not know her relationship<lb>
to the man whom I had only nursed for a day, and was about<lb>
to tell her he was gone, when McGee, the tender-hearted<lb>
Irishman before mentioned, brushed by me with a cheerful &mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;It's shifted to a better bed he is, Mrs. Connel. Come out,<lb>
dear, till I show ye;&rdquo; and, taking her gently by the arm, he<lb>
led her to the matron, who broke the heavy tidings to the<lb>
wife, and comforted the widow.</p>
<p>Another day, running up to my room for a breath of fresh<lb>
air and a five minutes' rest after a disagreeable task, I found<lb>
a stout young woman sitting on my bed, wearing the miserable<lb>
look which I had learned to know by that time. Seeing<lb>
her, reminded me that I had heard of some one's dying in the<lb>
night, and his sister's arriving in the morning. This must be<lb>
she, I thought. I pitied her with all my heart. What could<lb>
I say or do? Words always seem impertinent at such times;<lb>
I did not know the man; the woman was neither interesting<lb>
in herself nor graceful in her grief; yet, having known a<lb>
sister's sorrow myself, I could not leave her alone with her<lb>
trouble in that strange place, without a word. So, feeling<lb>
heart-sick, home-sick, and not knowing what else to do, I just<lb>
put my arms about her, and began to cry in a very helpless<lb>
but hearty way; for, as I seldom indulge in this moist luxury,<lb>
I like to enjoy it with all my might, when I do.</p>
<pb n="093">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-098">

<figdesc>Page 093.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>It so happened I could not have done a better thing; for,<lb>
though not a word was spoken, each felt the other's sympathy;<lb>
and, in the silence, our handkerchiefs were more eloquent<lb>
than words. She soon sobbed herself quiet; and, leaving her<lb>
on my bed, I went back to work, feeling much refreshed by<lb>
the shower, though I'd forgotten to rest, and had washed my<lb>
face instead of my hands. I mention this successful experiment<lb>
as a receipt proved and approved, for the use of any<lb>
nurse who may find herself called upon to minister to these<lb>
wounds of the heart. They will find it more efficacious than<lb>
cups of tea, smelling-bottles, psalms, or sermons; for a friendly<lb>
touch and a companionable cry, unite the consolations of all<lb>
the rest for womankind; and, if genuine, will be found a<lb>
sovereign cure for the first sharp pang so many suffer in these<lb>
heavy times.</p>
<p>I am gratified to find that my little Sergeant has found<lb>
favor in several quarters, and gladly respond to sundry calls<lb>
for news of him, though my personal knowledge ended five<lb>
months ago. Next to my good John &mdash; I hope the grass is<lb>
green above him, far away there in Virginia! &mdash; I placed the<lb>
Sergeant on my list of worthy boys; and many a jovial chat<lb>
have I enjoyed with the merry-hearted lad, who had a fancy<lb>
for fun, when his poor arm was dressed. While Dr. P. poked<lb>
and strapped, I brushed the remains of the Sergeant's brown<lb>
mane &mdash; shorn sorely against his will &mdash; and gossiped with all<lb>
my might, the boy making odd faces, exclamations, and<lb>
appeals, when nerves got the better of nonsense, as they<lb>
sometimes did:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd rather laugh than cry, when I must sing out anyhow,<lb>
so just say that bit from Dickens again, please, and I'll stand<lb>
it like a man.&rdquo; He did; for &ldquo;Mrs. Cluppins,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chadband,&rdquo;<lb>
and &ldquo;Sam Weller,&rdquo; always helped him through;<lb>
<pb n="094">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-099">

<figdesc>Page 094.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
thereby causing me to lay another offering of love and admiration<lb>
on the shrine of the god of my idolatry, though he does<lb>
wear too much jewelry and talk slang.</p>
<p>The Sergeant also originated, I believe, the fashion of calling<lb>
his neighbors by their afflictions instead of their names; and I<lb>
was rather taken aback by hearing them bandy remarks of<lb>
this sort, with perfect good humor and much enjoyment of the<lb>
new game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, old Fits is off again!&rdquo; &ldquo;How are you, Rheumatiz?&rdquo;<lb>
&ldquo;Will you trade apples, Ribs?&rdquo; &ldquo;I say, Miss P.,<lb>
may I give Typus a drink of this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Look here, No Toes,<lb>
lend us a stamp, there's a good feller,&rdquo; etc. He himself was<lb>
christened &ldquo;Baby B.,&rdquo; because he tended his arm on a little<lb>
pillow, and called it his infant.</p>
<p>Very fussy about his grub was Sergeant B., and much<lb>
trotting of attendants was necessary when he partook of nourishment.<lb>
Anything more irresistably wheedlesome I never<lb>
saw, and constantly found myself indulging him, like the most<lb>
weak-minded parent, merely for the pleasure of seeing his<lb>
brown eyes twinkle, his merry mouth break into a smile, and<lb>
his one hand execute a jaunty little salute that was entirely<lb>
captivating. I am afraid that Nurse P. damaged her dignity,<lb>
frolicking with this persuasive young gentleman, though done<lb>
for his well-being. But &ldquo;boys will be boys,&rdquo; is perfectly<lb>
applicable to the case; for, in spite of years, sex, and the<lb>
&ldquo;prunes-and-prisms&rdquo; doctrine laid down for our use, I have<lb>
a fellow feeling for lads, and always owed Fate a grudge<lb>
because I wasn't a lord of creation instead of a lady.</p>
<p>Since I left, I have heard, from a reliable source, that my<lb>
Sergeant has gone home; therefore, the small romance that<lb>
budded the first day I saw him, has blossomed into its second<lb>
chapter; and I now imagine &ldquo;dearest Jane&rdquo; filling my place,<lb>
<pb n="095">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-100">

<figdesc>Page 095.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
tending the wounds I tended, brushing the curly jungle I<lb>
brushed, loving the excellent little youth I loved, and eventually<lb>
walking altarward, with the Sergeant stumping gallantly<lb>
at her side. If she doesn't do all this, and no end more, I'll<lb>
never forgive her; and sincerely pray to the guardian saint<lb>
of lovers, that &ldquo;Baby B.&rdquo; may prosper in his wooing, and<lb>
his name be long in the land.</p>
<p>One of the lively episodes of hospital life, is the frequent<lb>
marching away of such as are well enough to rejoin their<lb>
regiments, or betake themselves to some convalescent camp.<lb>
The ward master comes to the door of each room that is to be<lb>
thinned, reads off a list of names, bids their owners look<lb>
sharp and be ready when called for; and, as he vanishes, the<lb>
rooms fall into an indescribable state of topsy-turvyness, as<lb>
the boys begin to black their boots, brighten spurs, if they<lb>
have them, overhaul knapsacks, make presents; are fitted out<lb>
with needfuls, and &mdash; well, why not? &mdash; kissed sometimes, as<lb>
they say, good by; for in all human probability we shall<lb>
never meet again, and a woman's heart yearns over anything<lb>
that has clung to her for help and comfort. I never liked<lb>
these breakings-up of my little household; though my short<lb>
stay showed me but three. I was immensely gratified by the<lb>
hand shakes I got, for their somewhat painful cordiality assured<lb>
me that I had not tried in vain. The big Prussian rumbled<lb>
out his unintelligible <hi rend="italics">adieux,</hi> with a grateful face and a<lb>
premonitory smooth of his yellow moustache, but got no<lb>
farther, for some ene else stepped up, with a large brown hand<lb>
extended, and this recommendation of our very faulty establishment:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We're off, ma'am, and I'm powerful sorry, for I'd no idea<lb>
a 'orspittle was such a jolly place. Hope I'll git another ball<lb>
<pb n="096">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-101">

<figdesc>Page 096.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
somewheres easy, so I'll come back, and be took care on<lb>
again. Mean, ain't it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn't think so, but the doctrine of inglorious ease was<lb>
not the the right one to preach up, so I tried to look shocked,<lb>
failed signally, and consoled myself by giving him the fat<lb>
pincushion he had admired as the &ldquo;cutest little machine<lb>
agoin.&rdquo; Then they fell into line in front of the house, looking<lb>
rather wan and feeble some of them, but trying to step out<lb>
smartly and march in good order, though half the knapsacks<lb>
were carried by the guard, and several leaned on sticks instead<lb>
of shouldering guns. All looked up and smiled, or waved<lb>
heir hands and touched their caps, as they passed under our<lb>
windows down the long street, and so away, some to their<lb>
homes in this world, and some to that in the next; and, for<lb>
the rest of the day, I felt like Rachel mourning for her<lb>
children, when I saw the empty beds and missed the familiar<lb>
faces.</p>
<p>You ask if nurses are obliged to witness amputations and<lb>
such matters, as a part of their duty? I think not, unless<lb>
they wish; for the patient is under the effects of ether, and<lb>
needs no care but such as the surgeons can best give. Our<lb>
work begins afterward, when the poor soul comes to himself,<lb>
sick, faint, and wandering; full of strange pains and confused<lb>
visions, of disagreeable sensations and sights. Then we must<lb>
sooth and sustain, tend and watch; preaching and practicing<lb>
patience, till sleep and time have restored courage and selfcontrol.<lb>
</p>
<p>I witnessed several operations; for the height of my ambition<lb>
was to go to the front after a battle, and feeling that the sooner<lb>
I inured myself to trying sights, the more useful I should be.<lb>
Several of my mates shrunk from such things; for though the<lb>
<pb n="097">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-102">

<figdesc>Page 097.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
spirit was wholly willing, the flesh was inconveniently weak.<lb>
One funereal lady came to try her powers as a nurse; but, a<lb>
brief conversation eliciting the facts that she fainted at the<lb>
sight of blood, was afraid to watch alone, couldn't possibly<lb>
take care of delirious persons, was nervous about infections,<lb>
and unable to bear much fatigue, she was mildly dismissed.<lb>
I hope she found her sphere, but fancy a comfortable bandbox<lb>
on a high shelf would best meet the requirements of her case.</p>
<p>Dr. Z. suggested that I should witness a dissection; but I<lb>
never accepted his invitations, thinking that my nerves belonged<lb>
to the living, not to the dead, and I had better finish my education<lb>
as a nurse before I began that of a surgeon. But I<lb>
never met the little man skipping through the hall, with oddly<lb>
shaped cases in his hand, and an absorbed expression of countenance,<lb>
without being sure that a select party of surgeons<lb>
were at work in the dead house, which idea was a rather trying<lb>
one, when I knew the subject was some person whom I had<lb>
nursed and cared for.</p>
<p>But this must not lead any one to suppose that the surgeons<lb>
were willfully hard or cruel, though one of them remorsefully<lb>
confided to me that he feared his profession blunted his sensibilities,<lb>
and, perhaps, rendered him indifferent to the sight of<lb>
pain.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that in some cases it does; for, though<lb>
a capital surgeon and a kindly man, Dr. P., through long<lb>
acquaintance with many of the ills flesh is heir to, had acquired<lb>
a somewhat trying habit of regarding a man and his wound as<lb>
separate institutions, and seemed rather annoyed that the<lb>
former should express any opinion upon the latter, or claim<lb>
any right in it, while under his care. He had a way of<lb>
twitching off a bandage, and giving a limb a comprehensive<lb>
sort of clutch, which, though no doubt entirely scientific, was<lb>
<pb n="098">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-103">

<figdesc>Page 098.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
rather startling than soothing, and highly objectionable as a<lb>
means of preparing nerves for any fresh trial. He also<lb>
expected the patient to assist in small operations, as he considered<lb>
them, and to restrain all demonstrations during the<lb>
process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my man, just hold it this way, while I look into it<lb>
a bit,&rdquo; he said one day to Fitz G., putting a wounded arm<lb>
into the keeping of a sound one, and proceeding to poke<lb>
about among bits of bone and visible muscles, in a red and<lb>
black chasm made by some infernal machine of the shot or<lb>
shell description. Poor Fitz held on like grim Death, ashamed<lb>
to show fear before a woman, till it grew more than he could<lb>
bear in silence; and, after a few smothered groans, he looked<lb>
at me imploringly, as if he said, &ldquo;I wouldn't, ma'am, if I<lb>
could help it,&rdquo; and fainted quietly away.</p>
<p>Dr. P. looked up, gave a compassionate sort of cluck, and<lb>
poked away more busily than ever, with a nod at me and a<lb>
brief &mdash; &ldquo;Never mind; be so good as to hold this till I finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed, cherishing the while a strong desire to insinuate a<lb>
few of his own disagreeable knives and scissors into him, and<lb>
see how he liked it. A very disrespectful and ridiculous<lb>
faney, of course; for he was doing all that could be done,<lb>
and the arm prospered finely in his hands. But the human<lb>
mind is prone to prejudice; and, though a personable man,<lb>
speaking French like a born &ldquo;Parley voo,&rdquo; and whipping off<lb>
legs like an animated guillotine, I must confess to a sense of<lb>
relief when he was ordered elsewhere; and suspect that several<lb>
of the men would have faced a rebel battery with less trepidation<lb>
than they did Dr. P., when he came briskly in on his<lb>
morning round.</p>
<p>As if to give us the pleasures of contrast, Dr. Z. succeeded<lb>
him, who, I think, suffered more in giving pain than did his<lb>
<pb n="099">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-104">

<figdesc>Page 099.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
patients in enduring it; for he often paused to ask: &ldquo;Do I<lb>
hurt you?&rdquo; and, seeing his solicitude, the boys invariably<lb>
answered: &ldquo;Not much; go ahead, Doctor,&rdquo; though the lips<lb>
that uttered this amiable fib might be white with pain as they<lb>
spoke. Over the dressing of some of the wounds, we used<lb>
to carry on conversations upon subjects foreign to the work in<lb>
hand, that the patient might forget himself in the eharms of<lb>
our discourse. Christmas eve was spent in this way; the<lb>
Doctor strapping the little Sergeant's arm, I holding the lamp,<lb>
while all three laughed and talked, as if anywhere but in a<lb>
hospital ward; except when the chat was broken by a longdrawn<lb>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; from &ldquo;Baby B.,&rdquo; an abrupt request from the<lb>
Doctor to &ldquo;Hold the lamp a little higher, please,&rdquo; or an<lb>
encouraging, &ldquo;Most through, Sergeant,&rdquo; from Nurse P.</p>
<p>The chief Surgeon, Dr. O., I was told, refused the higher<lb>
salary, greater honor, and less labor, of an appointment to<lb>
the Officer's Hospital, round the corner, that he might serve<lb>
the poor fellows at Hurlyburly House, or go to the front,<lb>
working there day and night, among the horrors that succeed<lb>
the glories of a battle. I liked that so much, that the quiet,<lb>
brown-eyed Doctor was my especial admiration; and when my<lb>
own turn came, had more faith in him than in all the rest<lb>
put together, although he did advise me to go home, and<lb>
authorize the consumption of blue pills.</p>
<p>Speaking of the surgeons reminds me that, having found all<lb>
manner of fault, it becomes me to celebrate the redeeming<lb>
feature of Hurlyburly House. I had been prepared by the<lb>
accounts of others, to expect much humiliation of spirit from<lb>
the surgeons, and to be treated by them like a door-mat, a<lb>
worm, or any other meek and lowly article, whose mission it<lb>
is to be put down and walked upon; nurses being considered<lb>
as mere servants, receiving the lowest pay, and, it's my private<lb>
<pb n="100">

</eaffig>
opinion, doing the hardest work of any part of the army,<lb>
except the mules. Great, therefore, was my surprise, when I<lb>
found myself treated with the utmost courtesy and kindness.<lb>
Very soon my carefully prepared meekness was laid upon the<lb>
shelf; and, going from one extreme to the other, I more than<lb>
once expressed a difference of opinion regarding sundry messes<lb>
it was my painful duty to administer.</p>
<p>As eight of us nurses chanced to be off duty at once, we<lb>
had an excellent opportunity of trying the virtues of these<lb>
gentlemen; and I am bound to say they stood the test admirably,<lb>
as far as my personal observation went. Dr. O.'s<lb>
stethescope was unremitting in its attentions; Dr. S. brought<lb>
his buttons into my room twice a day, with the regularity of a<lb>
medical clock; while Dr. Z. filled my table with neat little<lb>
bottles, which I never emptied, prescribed Browning, bedewed<lb>
me with Cologne, and kept my fire going, as if, like the candles<lb>
in St. Peter's, it must never be permitted to die out. Waking,<lb>
one cold night, with the certainty that my last spark had pined<lb>
away and died, and consequently hours of coughing were in<lb>
store for me, I was much amazed to see a ruddy light dancing<lb>
on the wall, a jolly blaze roaring up the chimney, and, down<lb>
upon his knees before it, Dr. Z., whittling shavings. I ought<lb>
to have risen up and thanked him on the spot; but, knowing<lb>
that he was one of those who like to do good by stealth, I<lb>
only peeped at him as if he were a friendly ghost; till, having<lb>
made things as cozy as the most motherly of nurses could<lb>
have done, he crept away, leaving me to feel, as somebody<lb>
says, &ldquo;as if angels were a watching of me in my sleep;&rdquo;<lb>
though that species of wild fowl do not usually descend in<lb>
broadcloth and glasses. I afterwards discovered that he split<lb>
the wood himself on that cool January midnight, and went<lb>
about making or mending fires for the poor old ladies in their<lb>
<pb n="101">
<eaffig volid="eaf441T" entity="f441-106">

<figdesc>Page 101.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
dismal dens; thus causing himself to be felt&mdash;a bright and<lb>
shining light in more ways than one. I never thanked him<lb>
as I ought; therefore, I publicly make a note of it, and further<lb>
aggravate that modest M. D. by saying that if this was not<lb>
being the best of doctors and the gentlest of gentlemen, I shall<lb>
be happy to see any improvement upon it.</p>
<p>To such as wish to know where these scenes took place, I<lb>
must respectfully decline to answer; for Hurly-burly House<lb>
has ceased to exist as a hospital; so let it rest, with all its<lb>
sins upon its head,&mdash;perhaps I should say chimney top.<lb>
When the nurses felt ill, the doctors departed, and the patients<lb>
got well, I believe the concern gently faded from existence, or<lb>
was merged into some other and better establishment, where I<lb>
hope the washing of three hundred sick people is done out of<lb>
the house, the food is eatable, and mortal women are not<lb>
expected to possess an angelic exemption from all wants, and<lb>
the endurance of truck horses.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of these hasty Sketches, I have heard<lb>
from several of my comrades at the Hospital; and their<lb>
approval assures me that I have not let sympathy and fancy<lb>
run away with me, as that lively team is apt to do when<lb>
harnessed to a pen. As no two persons see the same thing<lb>
with the same eyes, my view of hospital life must be taken<lb>
through my glass, and held for what it is worth. Certainly,<lb>
nothing was set down in malice, and to the serious-minded<lb>
party who objected to a tone of levity in some portions of the<lb>
Sketches, I can only say that it is a part of my religion to<lb>
look well after the cheerfulnesses of life, and let the dismals<lb>
shift for themselves; believing, with good Sir Thomas More,<lb>
that it is wise to &ldquo;be merrie in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next hospital I enter will, I hope, be one for the<lb>
colored regiments, as they seem to be proving their right to<lb>

owe them so large a debt, a little part of which I shall be so<lb>
proud to pay.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> room fronted the west, but a black cloud, barred<lb>
with red, robbed the hour of twilight's tranquil charm.<lb>
Shadows haunted it, lurking in corners like spies set there<lb>
to watch the man who stood among them mute and motionless<lb>
as if himself a shadow. His eye turned often to the<lb>
window with a glance both vigilant and eager, yet saw<lb>
nothing but a tropical luxuriance of foliage scarcely stirred<lb>
by the sultry air heavy with odors that seemed to oppress<lb>
not refresh. He listened with the same intentness, yet<lb>
heard only the clamor of voices, the tramp of feet, the<lb>
chime of bells, the varied turmoil of a city when night is<lb>
defrauded of its peace by being turned to day. He watched<lb>
and waited for something; presently it came. A viewless<lb>
visitant, welcomed by longing soul and body as the man,<lb>
with extended arms and parted lips received the voiceless<lb>
greeting of the breeze that came winging its way across<lb>
the broad Atlantic, full of healthful cheer for a home-sick<lb>
heart. Far out he leaned; held back the thick-leaved<lb>
boughs already rustling with a grateful stir, chid the shrill<lb>

bird beating its flame-colored breast against its prison bars,<lb>
and drank deep draughts of the blessed wind that seemed<lb>
to cool the fever of his blood and give him back the vigor<lb>
he had lost.</p>
<p>A sudden light shone out behind him filling the room<lb>
with a glow that left no shadow in it. But he did not see<lb>
the change, nor hear the step that broke the hush, nor turn<lb>
to meet the woman who stood waiting for a lover's welcome.<lb>
An indefinable air of sumptuous life surrounded her, and<lb>
made the brilliant room a fitting frame for the figure standing<lb>
there with warm-hued muslins blowing in the wind.<lb>
A figure full of the affluent beauty of womanhood in its<lb>
prime, bearing unmistakable marks of the polished pupil<lb>
of the world in the grace that flowed through every motion,<lb>
the art which taught each feature to play its part with the<lb>
ease of second nature and made dress the foil to loveliness.<lb>
The face was delicate and dark as a fine bronze, a low forehead<lb>
set in shadowy waves of hair, eyes full of slumberous<lb>
fire, and a passionate yet haughty mouth that seemed<lb>
shaped alike for caresses and commands.</p>
<p>A moment she watched the man before her, while over<lb>
her countenance passed rapid variations of pride, resentment,<lb>
and tenderness. Then with a stealthy step, an assured<lb>
smile, she went to him and touched his hand, saying,<lb>
in a voice inured to that language which seems made for<lb>
lovers' lips &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a month betrothed, and yet so cold and gloomy,<lb>
Adam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a slight recoil, a glance of soft detestation veiled<lb>
and yet visible, Warwick answered like a satiric echo &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a month betrothed, and yet so fond and jealous,<lb>
Ottila!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="009">

</p>
<p>Unchilled by the action, undaunted by the look, the<lb>
white arm took him captive, the beautiful face drew nearer,<lb>
and the persuasive voice asked wistfully &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it of me you thought when you turned with that<lb>
longing in your eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it of a fairer or a dearer friend than I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black brows contracted ominously, the mouth grew<lb>
hard, the eyes glittered, the arm became a closer bond, the<lb>
entreaty a command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know the name, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Self-respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed low to herself, and the mobile features softened<lb>
to their former tenderness as she looked up into that<lb>
other face so full of an accusing significance which she<lb>
would not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have waited two long hours; have you no kinder<lb>
greeting, love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no truer one. Ottila, if a man has done unwittingly<lb>
a weak, unwise, or wicked act, what should he<lb>
do when he discovers it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repent and mend his ways; need I tell you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have repented; will you help me mend my ways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confess, dear sinner; I will shrive you and grant absolution<lb>
for the past, whatever it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would you do for love of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything for you, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then give me back my liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose erect and stretched his hands to her with a gesture<lb>
of entreaty, an expression of intense desire. Ottila<lb>
fell back as if the forceful words and action swept her from<lb>
<pb n="010">

him. The smile died on her lips, a foreboding fear looked<lb>
out at her eyes, and she asked incredulously &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; now, entirely, and forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had lifted his strong arm and struck her, it would<lb>
not have daunted with such pale dismay. An instant she<lb>
stood like one who saw a chasm widening before her, which<lb>
she had no power to cross. Then as if disappointment was<lb>
a thing impossible and unknown, she seized the imploring<lb>
hands in a grasp that turned them white with its passionate<lb>
pressure as she cried &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will not! I have waited for your love so long<lb>
I cannot give it up; you shall not take it from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as if the words had made the deed irrevocable, Warwick<lb>
put her away, speaking with the stern accent of one<lb>
who fears a traitor in himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot take from you what you never had. Stand<lb>
there and hear me. No; I will have no blandishments to<lb>
keep me from my purpose, no soft words to silence the hard<lb>
ones I mean to speak, no more illusions to hide us from<lb>
each other and ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam, you are cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better seem cruel than be treacherous; better wound<lb>
your pride now than your heart hereafter, when too late you<lb>
discover that I married you without confidence, respect, or<lb>
love. For once in your life you shall hear the truth as<lb>
plain as words can make it. You shall see me at my best<lb>
as at my worst; you shall know what I have learned to find<lb>
in you; shall look back into the life behind us, forward into<lb>
the life before us, and if there be any candor in you I will<lb>
wring from you an acknowledgment that you have led me<lb>
into an unrighteous compact. Unrighteous, because you<lb>
<pb n="011">

</eaffig>
have deceived me in yourself, appealed to the baser, not the<lb>
nobler instincts in me, and on such a foundation there can<lb>
be no abiding happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, I will hear you.&rdquo; And conscious that she could<lb>
not control the will now thoroughly aroused, Ottila bent<lb>
before it as if meekly ready to hear all things for love's<lb>
sake.</p>
<p>A disdainful smile passed over Warwick's face, as with<lb>
an eye that fixed and held her own, he rapidly went on,<lb>
never pausing to choose smooth phrases or soften facts, but<lb>
seeming to find a relish in the utterance of bitter truths<lb>
after the honeyed falsehood he had listened to so long. Yet<lb>
through all the harshness glowed the courage of an upright<lb>
soul, the fervor of a generous heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know little of such things and care less; but I think<lb>
few lovers pass through a scene such as this is to be, because<lb>
few have known lives like ours, or are such as we. You a<lb>
woman stronger for good or ill than those about you, I a<lb>
man untamed by any law but that of my own will. Strength<lb>
is royal, we both possess it; as kings and queens drop their<lb>
titles in their closets, let us drop all disguises and see each<lb>
other as God sees us. This compact must be broken; let<lb>
me show you why. Three months ago I came here to take<lb>
the chill of an Arctic winter out of blood and brain. I<lb>
have done so and am the worse for it. In melting frost I<lb>
have kindled fire; a fire that will burn all virtue out of me<lb>
unless I quench it at once. I mean to do so, because I will<lb>
not keep the ten commandments before men's eyes and break<lb>
them every hour in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a moment, as if hotter words rose to his lips<lb>
than generosity would let him utter, and when he spoke<lb>
again there was more reproach than anger in his voice.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ottila, till I knew you I loved no woman but my<lb>
mother; I wooed no wife, bought no mistress, desired no<lb>
friend, but led a life austere as any monk's, asking only<lb>
freedom and my work. Could you not let me keep my<lb>
independence? Were there not men enough who would<lb>
find no degradation in a spiritual slavery like this? Would<lb>
nothing but my subjection satisfy your unconquerable appetite<lb>
for power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I seek you, Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Not openly, I grant, your art was too fine for<lb>
that; you shunned me that I might seek you to ask why.<lb>
In interviews that seemed to come by chance, you tried<lb>
every wile a woman owns, and they are many. You wooed<lb>
me as such as you alone can woo the hearts they know are<lb>
hardest to be won. You made your society a refreshment<lb>
in this climate of the passions; you hid your real self and<lb>
feigned that for which I felt most honor. You entertained<lb>
my beliefs with largest hospitality; encouraged my ambitions<lb>
with a sympathy so genial that I thought it genuine;<lb>
professed my scorn for shammery, and seemed an earnest<lb>
woman, eager to find the true, to do the right; a fit wife<lb>
for any man who desired a helpmate, not a toy. It showed<lb>
much strength of wit and will to conceive and execute the<lb>
design. It proved your knowledge of the virtues you could<lb>
counterfeit so well, else I never should have been where I<lb>
am now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your commendation is deserved, though so ungently<lb>
given, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no more of it. If I am ungentle, it is<lb>
because I despise deceit, and you possess a guile that has<lb>
given me my first taste of self-contempt, and the draught is<lb>
bitter. Hear me out; for this reminiscence is my<lb>

<milestn unit="collation" n="2">
justification; you must listen to the one and accept the other.<lb>
You seemed all this, but under the honest friendliness you<lb>
showed lurked the purpose you have since avowed, to conquer<lb>
most entirely the man who denied your right to rule<lb>
by the supremacy of beauty or of sex alone. You saw the<lb>
unsuspected fascination that detained me here when my<lb>
better self said `Go.' You allured my eye with loveliness,<lb>
my ear with music; piqued curiosity, pampered pride, and<lb>
subdued will by flatteries subtly administered. Beginning<lb>
afar off, you let all influences do their work till the moment<lb>
came for the effective stroke. Then you made a crowning<lb>
sacrifice of maiden modesty and owned you loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shame burned red on Ottila's dark cheek, and ire flamed<lb>
up in her eyes, as the untamable spirit of the woman<lb>
answered against her will &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not made in vain; for, rebellious as you are, it<lb>
subdued you, and with your own weapon, the bare truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had said truly, &ldquo;You shall see me at my best as at<lb>
worst.&rdquo; She did, for putting pride underneath his feet he<lb>
showed her a brave sincerity, which she could admire but<lb>
never imitate, and in owning a defeat achieved a victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I shall deny this. I do not, but acknowledge<lb>
to the uttermost that, in spite of all resistance, I was<lb>
conquered by a woman. If it affords you satisfaction to<lb>
hear this, to know that it is hard to say, harder still to<lb>
feel, take the ungenerous delight; I give it to you as an<lb>
alms. But remember that if I have failed, no less have<lb>
you. For in that stormy heart of yours there is no sentiment<lb>
more powerful than that you feel for me, and through<lb>
it you will receive the retribution you have brought upon<lb>
yourself. You were elated with success, and forgot too<lb>
soon the character you had so well supported. You thought<lb>
<pb n="014">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-019">

<figdesc>Page 014.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
love blinded me, but there was no love; and during this<lb>
month I have learned to know you as you are. A woman<lb>
of strong passions and weak principles; hungry for power<lb>
and intent on pleasure; accomplished in deceit and reckless<lb>
in trampling on the nobler instincts of a gifted but<lb>
neglected nature. Ottila, I have no faith in you, feel no<lb>
respect for the passion you inspire, own no allegiance to<lb>
the dominion you assert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot throw it off; it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a rash defiance; she saw that as it passed her<lb>
lips, and would have given much to have recalled it. The<lb>
stern gravity of Warwick's face flashed into a stern indignation.<lb>
His eye shone like steel, but his voice dropped<lb>
lower and his hand closed like a vice as he said, with the<lb>
air of one who cannot conceal but can control sudden wrath<lb>
at a taunt to which past weakness gives a double sting &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never is too late. If the priest stood ready, and I<lb>
had sworn to marry you within the hour, I would break the<lb>
cath, and God would pardon it, for no man has a right to<lb>
embrace temptation and damn himself by a life-long lie.<lb>
You choose to make it a hard battle for me; you are<lb>
neither an honest friend nor a generous foe. No matter, I<lb>
have fallen into an ambuscade and must cut my way out<lb>
as I can, and as I will, for there is enough of this Devil's<lb>
work in the world without our adding to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot escape with honor, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot remain with honor. Do not try me too hardly,<lb>
Ottila. I am not patient, but I do desire to be just.<lb>
I confess my weakness; will not that satisfy you? Blazon<lb>
your wrong as you esteem it; ask sympathy of those who<lb>
see not as I see; reproach, defy, lament. I will bear it<lb>
all, will make any other sacrifice as an atonement, but I<lb>
<pb n="015">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-020">

<figdesc>Page 015.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
will `hold fast mine integrity' and obey a higher law than<lb>
your world recognizes, both for your sake and my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched him as he spoke, and to herself confessed a<lb>
slavery more absolute than any he had known, for with a<lb>
pang she felt that she had indeed fallen into the snare she<lb>
spread for him, and in this man, who dared to own his<lb>
weakness and her power, she had found a master. Was it<lb>
too late to keep him? She knew that soft appeals were<lb>
vain, tears like water on a rock, and with the skill that<lb>
had subdued him once she endeavored to retrieve her blunder<lb>
by an equanimity which had more effect than prayers<lb>
or protestations. Warwick had read her well, had shown<lb>
her herself stripped of all disguises, and left her no defence<lb>
but tardy candor. She had the wisdom to see this, the wit<lb>
to use it and restore the shadow of the power whose substance<lb>
she had lost. Leaving her beauty to its silent work,<lb>
she fixed on him eyes whose lustre was quenched in unshed<lb>
tears, and said with an earnest, humble voice &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, desire to be just. I will not reproach, defy, or<lb>
lament, but leave my fate to you. I am all you say, yet<lb>
in your judgment remember merey, and believe that at<lb>
twenty-five there is still hope for the noble but neglected<lb>
nature, still time to repair the faults of birth, education,<lb>
and orphanhood. You say, I have a daring will, a love of<lb>
conquest. Can I not will to overcome myself and do it?<lb>
Can I not learn to be the woman I have seemed? Love<lb>
has worked greater miracles; may it not work this? I<lb>
have longed to be a truer creature than I am; have seen<lb>
my wasted gifts, felt my capacity for better things, and<lb>
looked for help from many sources, but never found it till<lb>
you came. Do you wonder that I tried to make it mine?<lb>
Adam, you are a self-elected missionary to the world's<lb>
<pb n="016">

</eaffig>
afflicted; you can look beyond external poverty and see the<lb>
indigence of souls. I am a pauper in your eyes; stretch<lb>
out your hand and save me from myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight through the one vulnerable point in the man's<lb>
pride went this appeal to the man's pity. Indignation<lb>
could not turn it aside, contempt blunt its edge, or wounded<lb>
feeling lessen its force; and yet it failed: for in Adam<lb>
Warwick justice was stronger than mercy, reason than impulse,<lb>
head than heart. Experience was a teacher whom<lb>
he trusted; he had weighed this woman and found her<lb>
wanting; truth was not in her; the patient endeavor, the<lb>
hard-won success so possible to many was hardly so to her,<lb>
and a union between them could bring no lasting good to<lb>
either. He knew this; had decided it in a calmer hour<lb>
than the present, and by that decision he would now abide<lb>
proof against all attacks from without or from within.<lb>
More gently, but as inflexibly as before, he said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do put out my hand and offer you the same bitter<lb>
draught of self-contempt that proved a tonic to my own<lb>
weak will. I can help, pity, and forgive you heartily, but<lb>
I dare not marry you. The tie that binds us is a passion<lb>
of the senses, not a love of the soul. You lack the moral<lb>
sentiment that makes all gifts and graces subservient to<lb>
the virtues that render womanhood a thing to honor as well<lb>
as love. I can relinquish youth, beauty, worldly advantages,<lb>
but I must reverence above all others the woman<lb>
whom I marry, and feel an affection that elevates me by<lb>
quickening all that is noblest and manliest in me. With<lb>
you I should be either a tyrant or a slave. I will be<lb>
neither, but go solitary all my life rather than rashly mortgage<lb>
the freedom kept inviolate so long, or let the impulse<lb>
of an hour mar the worth of coming years.&rdquo;</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="2 *">
<p>Bent and broken by the unanswerable accusations of<lb>
what seemed a conscience in human shape, Ottila had sunk<lb>
down before him with an abandonment as native to her as<lb>
the indomitable will which still refused to relinquish hope<lb>
even in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am not worthy of salvation. Yet<lb>
it is hard, very hard, to lose the one motive strong enough<lb>
to save me, the one sincere affection of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick had expected a tempestuous outbreak at his<lb>
decision; this entire submission touched him, for in the<lb>
last words of her brief lament he detected the accent of<lb>
truth, and longed to answer it. He paused, searching for<lb>
the just thing to be done. Ottila, with hidden face, watched<lb>
while she wept, and waited hopefully for the relenting sign.<lb>
In silence the two, a modern Samson and Delilah, waged<lb>
the old war that has gone on ever since the strong locks<lb>
were shorn and the temple fell; a war which fills the world<lb>
with unmated pairs and the long train of evils arising from<lb>
marriages made from impulse, and not principle. As usual,<lb>
the most generous was worsted. The silence pleaded well<lb>
for Ottila, and when Warwick spoke it was to say impetuously&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right! It is hard that when two err one alone<lb>
should suffer. I should have been wise enough to see the<lb>
danger, brave enough to fly from it. I was not, and I owe<lb>
you some reparation for the pain my folly brings you. I<lb>
offer you the best, because the hardest, sacrifice that I can<lb>
make. You say love can work miracles, and that yours is<lb>
the sincerest affection of your life; prove it. In three<lb>
months you conquered me; can you conquer yourself in<lb>
twelve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. Nature takes a year for her harvests; I give<lb>
you the same for yours. If you will devote one half the<lb>
energy and care to this work that you devoted to that other, &mdash;<lb>
will earnestly endeavor to cherish all that is womanly<lb>
and noble in yourself, and through desire for another's<lb>
respect earn your own, &mdash; I, too, will try to make myself a<lb>
fitter mate for any woman, and keep our troth unbroken for<lb>
a year. Can I do more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dared not ask so much! I have not deserved it, but<lb>
I will. Only love me, Adam, and let me save myself<lb>
through you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flushed and trembling with delight she rose, sure the<lb>
trial was safely passed, but found that for herself a new<lb>
one had begun. Warwick offered his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going? Surely you will stay and help me through<lb>
my long probation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; if your desire has any worth you can work it out<lb>
alone. We should be hindrances to one another, and the<lb>
labor be ill done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go? Not far, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight to the North. This luxurious life enervates<lb>
me; the pestilence of slavery lurks in the air and infects<lb>
me; I must build myself up anew and find again the man<lb>
I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When must you go? Not soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall hear from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall need encouragement, shall grow hungry<lb>
for a word, a thought from you. A year is very long to<lb>
wait and work alone.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>Eloquently she pleaded with voice and eyes and tender<lb>
lips, but Warwick did not yield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the test be tried at all it must be fairly tried. We<lb>
must stand entirely apart and see what saving virtue lies<lb>
in self-denial and self-help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will forget me, Adam. Some woman with a<lb>
calmer heart than mine will teach you to love as you desire<lb>
to love, and when my work is done it will be all in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never in vain if it be well done, for such labor is its<lb>
own reward. Have no fear; one such lesson will last a<lb>
lifetime. Do your part heartily, and I will keep my<lb>
pledge until the year is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I see in you the progress both should desire, if this<lb>
tie bears the test of time and absence, and we find any<lb>
basis for an abiding union, then, Ottila, I will marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if meanwhile that colder, calmer woman comes to<lb>
you, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will not marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, your promise is a man's vow, made only to be<lb>
broken. I have no faith in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you may have. There will be no time for<lb>
more folly; I must repair the loss of many wasted days, &mdash;<lb>
nay, not wasted if I have learned this lesson well. Rest<lb>
secure; it is impossible that I should love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believed that three months ago and yet you are a<lb>
lover now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ottila smiled an exultant smile, and Warwick acknowledged<lb>
his proven fallibility by a haughty flush and a frank<lb>
amendment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it stand, then, that if I love again I am to wait in<lb>
silence till the year is out and you absolve me from my<lb>
pledge. Does that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>

<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-025">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must. But you will come, whatever changes may<lb>
befall you? Promise me this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going so soon? Oh, wait a little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a duty is to be done, do it at once; delay is<lb>
dangerous. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me some remembrance of you. I have nothing,<lb>
for you are not a generous lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generous in deeds, Ottila. I have given you a year's<lb>
liberty, a dear gift from one who values it more than life.<lb>
Now I add this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her to him, kissed the red mouth and looked<lb>
down upon her with a glance that made his man's face as<lb>
pitiful as any woman's as he let her lean there happy in<lb>
the hope given at such cost. For a moment nothing stirred<lb>
in the room but the soft whisper of the wind. For a moment<lb>
Warwick's austere life looked hard to him, love seemed<lb>
sweet, submission possible; for in all the world this was<lb>
the only woman who clung to him, and it was beautiful to<lb>
cherish and be cherished after years of solitude. A long<lb>
sigh of desire and regret broke from him, and at the sound<lb>
a stealthy smile touched Ottila's lips as she whispered,<lb>
with a velvet cheek against his own &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, you will stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And like one who cries out sharply within himself, &ldquo;Get<lb>
thee behind me!&rdquo; he broke away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam, come back to me! Come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked over his shoulder, saw the fair woman in the<lb>
heart of the warm glow, heard her cry of love and longing,<lb>
knew the life of luxurious ease that waited for him, but<lb>
steadily went out into the night, only answering &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Come,</hi> Sylvia, it is nine o'clock! Little slug-a-bed, don't<lb>
you mean to get up to-day?&rdquo; said Miss Yule, bustling<lb>
into her sister's room with the wide-awake appearance of<lb>
one to whom sleep was a necessary evil, to be endured and<lb>
gotten over as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, why should I? And Sylvia turned her face away<lb>
from the flood of light that poured into the room as Prue<lb>
put aside the curtains and flung up the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you? What a question, unless you are<lb>
ill; I was afraid you would suffer for that long row yesterday,<lb>
and my predictions seldom fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not suffering from any cause whatever, and your<lb>
prediction does fail this time; I am only tired of everybody<lb>
and everything, and see nothing worth getting up for; so I<lb>
shall just stay here till I do. Please put the curtain down<lb>
and leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue had dropped her voice to the foreboding tone so<lb>
irritating to nervous persons whether sick or well, and<lb>
Sylvia laid her arm across her eyes with an impatient gesture<lb>
as she spoke sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing worth getting up for,&rdquo; cried Prue, like an<lb>
aggravating echo. &ldquo;Why, child, there are a hundred<lb>
pleasant things to do if you would only think so. Now<lb>
<pb n="022">

</eaffig>
don't be dismal and mope away this lovely day. Get up<lb>
and try my plan; have a good breakfast, read the papers,<lb>
and then work in your garden before it grows too warm;<lb>
that is wholesome exercise and you 've neglected it sadly of<lb>
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't wish any breakfast; I hate newspapers, they are<lb>
so full of lies; I'm tired of the garden, for nothing goes<lb>
right this year; and I detest taking exercise merely because<lb>
it 's wholesome. No, I 'll not get up for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stay in the house and draw, read, or practise.<lb>
Sit with mark in the studio; give Miss Hemming directions<lb>
about your summer things, or go into town about your<lb>
bonnet. There is a matin&eacute;e, try that: or make calls, for<lb>
you owe fifty at least. Now I'm sure there 's employment<lb>
enough and amusement enough for any reasonable person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue looked triumphant, but Sylvia was not a &ldquo;reasonable<lb>
person,&rdquo; and went on in her former despondingly<lb>
petulant strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm tired of drawing; my head is a jumble of other<lb>
people's ideas already, and Herr Pedalsturm has put the<lb>
piano out of tune. Mark always makes a model of me if<lb>
I go to him, and I don't like to see my eyes, arms, or hair<lb>
in all his pictures. Miss Hemming's gossip is worse than<lb>
fussing over new things that I don't need. Bonnets are my<lb>
torment, and matin&eacute;es are wearisome, for people whisper<lb>
and flirt till the music is spoiled. Making calls is the<lb>
worst of all; for what pleasure or profit is there in running<lb>
from place to place to tell the same polite fibs over and over<lb>
again, and listen to scandal that makes you pity or despise<lb>
your neighbors. I shall not get up for any of these<lb>
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue leaned on the bedpost meditating with an anxious<lb>
<pb n="023">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-028">

<figdesc>Page 023.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
face till a forlorn hope appeared which caused her to<lb>
exclaim &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark and I are going to see Geoffrey Moor, this morning,<lb>
just home from Switzerland, where his poor sister died,<lb>
you know. You really ought to come with us and welcome<lb>
him, for though you can hardly remember him, he 's been<lb>
so long away, still, as one of the family, it is a proper compliment<lb>
on your part. The drive will do you good, Geoffrey<lb>
will be glad to see you, it is a lovely old place, and as<lb>
you never saw the inside of the house you cannot complain<lb>
that you are tired of that yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I can, for it will never seem as it has done, and I<lb>
can no longer go where I please now that a master's presence<lb>
spoils its freedom and solitude for me. I don't know<lb>
him, and don't care to, though his name is so familiar.<lb>
New people always disappoint me, especially if I've heard<lb>
them praised ever since I was born. I shall not get up for<lb>
any Geoffrey Moor, so that bait fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia smiled involuntarily at her sister's defeat, but<lb>
Prue fell back upon her last resource in times like this.<lb>
With a determined gesture she plunged her hand into an<lb>
abysmal pocket, and from a miscellaneous collection of<lb>
treasures selected a tiny vial, presenting it to Sylvia with<lb>
a half pleading, half authoritative look and tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll leave you in peace if you 'll only take a dose of<lb>
chamomilla. It is so soothing, that instead of tiring yourself<lb>
with all manner of fancies, you 'll drop into a quiet<lb>
sleep, and by noon be ready to get up like a civilized<lb>
being. Do take it, dear; just four sugar-plums, and I'm<lb>
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia received the bottle with a docile expression; but<lb>
the next minute it flew out of the window, to be shivered<lb>
<pb n="024">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-029">

<figdesc>Page 024.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
on the walk below, while she said, laughing like a wilful<lb>
creature as she was &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have taken it in the only way I ever shall, and the<lb>
sparrows can try its soothing effects with me; so be satisfied.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I shall send for Dr. Baum, for I'm convinced<lb>
that you are going to be ill. I shall say no more,<lb>
but act as I think proper, because it 's like talking to the<lb>
wind to reason with you in one of these perverse fits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Prue turned away, Sylvia frowned and called after<lb>
her &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare yourself the trouble, for Dr. Baum will follow<lb>
the chamomilla, if you bring him here. What does he<lb>
know about health, a fat German, looking lager beer and<lb>
talking sauer-kraut? Bring me <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> sugar-plums and<lb>
I 'll take them; but arsenic, mercury, and nightshade are<lb>
not to my taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you feel insulted if I ask whether your breakfast<lb>
is to be sent up, or kept waiting till you choose to come<lb>
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue looked rigidly calm, but Sylvia knew that she felt<lb>
hurt, and with one of the sudden impulses which ruled her<lb>
the frown melted to a smile, as drawing her sister down she<lb>
kissed her in her most loving manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old soul, I'll be good by-and-by, but now I'm<lb>
tired and cross, so let me keep out of every one's way and<lb>
drowse myself into a cheerier frame of mind. I want<lb>
nothing but solitude, a draught of water, and a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue was mollified at once, and after stirring fussily<lb>
about for several minutes gave her sister all she asked, and<lb>
departed to the myriad small cares that made her happiness.<lb>
As the door closed, Sylvia sighed a long sigh of<lb>

<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-030">

<figdesc>Page 025.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="3">
relief, and folding her arms under her head drifted away into<lb>
the land of dreams, where ennui is unknown.</p>
<p>All the long summer morning she lay wrapt in sleeping<lb>
and waking dreams, forgetful of the world about her, till<lb>
her brother played the Wedding March upon her door on<lb>
his way to lunch. The desire to avenge the sudden downfall<lb>
of a lovely castle in the air roused Sylvia, and sent her<lb>
down to skirmish with Mark. Before she could say a word,<lb>
however, Prue began to talk in a steady stream, for the<lb>
good soul had a habit of jumbling news, gossip, private<lb>
opinions and public affairs into a colloquial hodge-podge,<lb>
that was often as trying to the intellects as the risibles of<lb>
her hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, we had a charming call, and Geoffrey sent his<lb>
love to you. I asked him over to dinner, and we shall dine<lb>
at six, because then my father can be with us. I shall<lb>
have to go to town first, for there are a dozen things suffering<lb>
for attention. You can't wear a round hat and lawn<lb>
jackets without a particle of set all summer. I want some<lb>
things for dinner, &mdash; and the carpet must be got. What a<lb>
lovely one Geoffrey had in the library! Then I must see<lb>
if poor Mrs. Beck has had her leg comfortably off, find out<lb>
if Freddy Lennox is dead, and order home the mosquito<lb>
nettings. Now don't read all the afternoon, and be ready<lb>
to receive any one who may come if I should get belated.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>The necessity of disposing of a suspended mouthful produced<lb>
a lull, and Sylvia seized the moment to ask in a<lb>
careless way, intended to bring her brother out upon his<lb>
favorite topic, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find your saint, Mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same sunshiny soul as ever, though he has had<lb>
<pb n="026">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-031">

<figdesc>Page 026.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enough to make him old and grave before his time. He is<lb>
just what we need in our neighborhood, and particularly in<lb>
our house, for we are a dismal set at times, and he will do<lb>
us all a world of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will become of me, with a pious, prosy, perfect<lb>
creature eternally haunting the house and exhorting me on<lb>
the error of my ways!&rdquo; cried Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't disturb yourself; he is not likely to take much<lb>
notice of you; and it is not for an indolent, freakish midge<lb>
to scoff at a man whom she does not know, and could n't<lb>
appreciate if she did,&rdquo; was Mark's lofty reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather liked the appearance of the saint, however,&rdquo;<lb>
said Sylvia, with an expression of naughty malice, as she<lb>
began her lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where did you see him!&rdquo; exclaimed her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went over there yesterday to take a farewell run in<lb>
the neglected garden before he came. I knew he was expected,<lb>
but not that he was here; and when I saw the<lb>
house open, I slipped in and peeped wherever I liked. You<lb>
are right, Prue; it is a lovely old place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know you did something dreadfully unladylike<lb>
and improper. Put me out of suspense, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue's distressful face and Mark's surprise produced an<lb>
inspiring effect upon Sylvia, who continued, with an air of<lb>
demure satisfaction &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I strolled about, enjoying myself, till I got into the<lb>
library, and there I rummaged, for it was a charming place,<lb>
and I was happy as only those are who love books, and feel<lb>
their influence in the silence of a room whose finest ornaments<lb>
they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Moor came in and found you trespassing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I went out and caught him playing. When I'd<lb>
<pb n="027">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-032">

<figdesc>Page 027.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stayed as long as I dared, and borrowed a very interesting<lb>
old book &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia! did you really take one without asking?&rdquo;<lb>
cried Prue, looking almost as much alarmed as if she had<lb>
stolen the spoons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; why not? I can apologize prettily, and it will<lb>
open the way for more. I intend to browse over that library<lb>
for the next six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was such a liberty, &mdash; so rude, so &mdash; dear, dear;<lb>
and he as fond and careful of his books as if they were his<lb>
children! Well, I wash my hands of it, and am prepared<lb>
for anything now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark enjoyed Sylvia's pranks too much to reprove, so he<lb>
only laughed while one sister lamented and the other placidly<lb>
went on &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had put the book nicely in my pocket, Prue, I<lb>
walked into the garden. But before I'd picked a single<lb>
flower, I heard little Tilly laugh behind the hedge and some<lb>
strange voice talking to her. So I hopped upon a roller to<lb>
see, and nearly tumbled off again; for there was a man lying<lb>
on the grass, with the gardener's children rioting over him.<lb>
Will was picking his pockets, and Tilly eating strawberries<lb>
out of his hat, often thrusting one into the mouth of her long<lb>
neighbor, who always smiled when the little hand came<lb>
fumbling at his lips. You ought to have seen the pretty<lb>
picture, Mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see the interesting picture on your side of the<lb>
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was just thinking what friendly eyes he had,<lb>
listening to his pleasant talk with the little folks, and<lb>
watching how they nestled to him as if he were a girl,<lb>
when Tilly looked up and cried, `I see Silver!' So I ran<lb>
<pb n="028">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-033">

<figdesc>Page 028.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
away, expecting to have them all come racing after. But<lb>
no one appeared, and I only heard a laugh instead of the<lb>
`stop thief' that I deserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had time I should convince you of the impropriety<lb>
of such wild actions; as I have n't, I can only implore you<lb>
never to do so again on Geoffrey's premises,&rdquo; said Prue,<lb>
rising as the carriage drove round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can safely promise that,&rdquo; answered Sylvia, with a<lb>
dismal shake of the head, as she leaned listlessly from the<lb>
window till her brother and sister were gone.</p>
<p>At the appointed time Moor entered Mr. Yule's hospitably<lb>
open door; but no one came to meet him, and the house<lb>
was as silent as if nothing human inhabited it. He divined<lb>
the cause of this, having met Prue and Mark going townward<lb>
some hours before, and saying to himself, &ldquo;The boat<lb>
is late,&rdquo; he disturbed no one, but strolled into the drawing-rooms<lb>
and looked about him. Being one of those who seldom<lb>
find time heavy on their hands, he amused himself<lb>
with observing what changes had been made during his<lb>
absence. His journey round the apartments was not a long<lb>
one, for, coming to an open window, he paused with an<lb>
expression of mingled wonder and amusement.</p>
<p>A pile of cushions, pulled from chair and sofa, lay<lb>
before the long window, looking very like a newly deserted<lb>
nest. A warm-hued picture lifted from the wall stood in<lb>
a streak of sunshine; a half cleared leaf of fruit lay on a<lb>
taboret, and beside it, with a red stain on its title-page,<lb>
appeared the stolen book. At sight of this Moor frowned,<lb>
caught up his descerated darling and put it in his pocket.<lb>
But as he took another glance at the various indications of<lb>
what had evidently been a solitary revel very much after<lb>
his own heart, he relented, laid back the book, and, putting<lb>
<pb n="29"><target id="p443-034">p443-034</target>

<milestn unit="collation" n="3 *">
aside the curtain floating in the wind, looked out into the<lb>
garden, attracted thither by the sound of a spade.</p>
<p>A lad was at work near by, and wondering what new<lb>
inmate the house had gained, the neglected guest waited to<lb>
catch a glimpse of the unknown face. A slender boy, in a<lb>
foreign-looking blouse of grey linen; a white collar lay<lb>
over a ribbon at the throat, stout half boots covered a trim<lb>
pair of feet, and a broad-brimmed hat flapped low on the<lb>
forehead. Whistling softly he dug with active gestures;<lb>
and, having made the necessary cavity, set a shrub, filled<lb>
up the hole, trod it down scientifically, and then fell back<lb>
to survey the success of his labors. But something was<lb>
amiss, something had been forgotten, for suddenly up came<lb>
the shrub, and seizing a wheelbarrow that stood near by,<lb>
away rattled the boy round the corner out of sight. Moor<lb>
smiled at his impetuosity, and awaited his return with interest,<lb>
suspecting from appearances that this was some<lb>
<hi rend="italics">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</hi> of Mark's employed as a model as well as gardener's<lb>
boy.</p>
<p>Presently up the path came the lad, with head down and<lb>
steady pace, trundling a barrow full of richer earth, surmounted<lb>
by a watering-pot. Never stopping for breath he<lb>
fell to work again, enlarged the hole, flung in the loam,<lb>
poured in the water, reset the shrub, and when the last<lb>
stamp and pat were given performed a little dance of<lb>
triumph about it, at the close of which he pulled off his<lb>
hat and began to fan his heated face. The action caused<lb>
the observer to start and look again, thinking, as he recognized<lb>
the energetic worker with a smile, &ldquo;What a changeful<lb>
thing it is! haunting one's premises unseen, and stealing<lb>
one's books unsuspected; dreaming one half the day and<lb>
masquerading the other half. What will happen next?<lb>
<pb n="030">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-035">

<figdesc>Page 030.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Let us see but not be seen, lest the boy turn shy and run<lb>
away before the pretty play is done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding the curtain between the window and himself,<lb>
Moor peeped through the semi-transparent screen, enjoying<lb>
the little episode immensely. Sylvia fanned and rested a<lb>
few minutes, then went up and down among the flowers,<lb>
often pausing to break a dead leaf, to brush away some<lb>
harmful insect, or lift some struggling plant into the light;<lb>
moving among them as if akin to them, and cognizant of<lb>
their sweet wants. If she had seemed strong-armed and<lb>
sturdy as a boy before, now she was tender fingered as a<lb>
woman, and went humming here and there like any happy-hearted<lb>
bee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious child!&rdquo; thought Moor, watching the sunshine<lb>
glitter on her uncovered head, and listening to the air she<lb>
left half sung. &ldquo;I've a great desire to step out and see<lb>
how she will receive me. Not like any other girl, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, before he could execute his design, the roll of a carriage<lb>
was heard in the avenue, and pausing an instant, with<lb>
head erect like a startled doe, Sylvia turned and vanished,<lb>
dropping flowers as she ran. Mr. Yule, accompanied by<lb>
his son and daughter, came hurrying in with greetings, explanations,<lb>
and apologies, and in a moment the house was<lb>
full of a pleasant stir. Steps went up and down, voices<lb>
echoed through the rooms, savory odors burst forth from<lb>
below, and doors swung in the wind, as if the spell was<lb>
broken and the sleeping palace had wakened with a word.</p>
<p>Prue made a hasty toilet and harassed the cook to the<lb>
verge of spontaneous combustion, while Mark and his father<lb>
devoted themselves to their guest. Just as dinner was announced<lb>
Sylvia came in, as calm and cool as if wheelbarrows<lb>
were myths and linen suits unknown. Moor was<lb>

welcomed with a quiet hand-shake, a grave salutation, and<lb>
a look that seemed to say, &ldquo;Wait a little, I take no friends<lb>
on trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All through dinner, though she sat as silent as a well-bred<lb>
child, she looked and listened with an expression of<lb>
keen intelligence that children do not wear, and sometimes<lb>
smiled to herself, as if she saw or heard something that<lb>
pleased and interested her. When they rose from table she<lb>
followed Prue up stairs, quite forgetting the disarray in<lb>
which the drawing-room was left. The gentlemen took<lb>
possession before either sister returned, and Mark's annoyance<lb>
found vent in a philippic against oddities in general<lb>
and Sylvia in particular; but his father and friend sat in<lb>
the cushionless chairs, and pronounced the scene amusingly<lb>
novel. Prue appeared in the midst of the laugh, and having<lb>
discovered other delinquencies above, her patience was exhausted,<lb>
and her regrets found no check in the presence of<lb>
so old a friend as Moor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must be done about that child, father, for<lb>
she is getting entirely beyond my control. If I attempt<lb>
to make her study she writes poetry instead of her exercises,<lb>
draws caricatures instead of sketching properly, and bewilders<lb>
her music teacher by asking questions about Beethoven<lb>
and Mendelssohn, as if they were personal friends of<lb>
his. If I beg her to take exercise, she rides like an Amazon<lb>
all over the Island, grubs in the garden as if for her<lb>
living, or goes paddling about the bay till I'm distracted<lb>
lest the tide should carry her out to sea. She is so wanting<lb>
in moderation she gets ill, and when I give her proper<lb>
medicines she flings them out of the window, and threatens<lb>
to send that worthy, Dr. Baum, after them. Yet she must<lb>
need something to set her right, for she is either<lb>
<pb n="032">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-037">

<figdesc>Page 032.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
overflowing with unnatural spirits or melancholy enough to break<lb>
one's heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with the little black sheep of my<lb>
flock, &mdash; not banished her, I hope?&rdquo; said Mr. Yule, placidly,<lb>
ignoring all complaints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in the garden, attending to some of her disagreeable<lb>
pets, I fancy. If you are going out there to smoke,<lb>
please send her in, Mark; I want her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Yule was evidently yearning for his after-dinner<lb>
nap, and Mark for his cigar, Moor followed his friend, and<lb>
they stepped through the window into the garden, now<lb>
lovely with the fading glow of summer sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know that this peculiar little sister of mine<lb>
clings to some of her childish beliefs and pleasures in spite<lb>
of Prue's preaching and my raillery,&rdquo; began Mark, after a<lb>
refreshing whiff or two. &ldquo;She is overflowing with love<lb>
and good will, but being too shy or too proud to offer it to<lb>
her fellow-creatures, she expends it upon the necessitous<lb>
inhabitants of earth, air, and water with the most charming<lb>
philanthropy. Her dependants are neither beautiful nor<lb>
very interesting, nor is she sentimentally enamored of<lb>
them; but the more ugly and desolate the creature, the<lb>
more devoted is she. Look at her now; most young<lb>
ladies would have hysterics over any one of those pets<lb>
of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moor looked, and thought the group a very pretty one,<lb>
though a plump toad sat at Sylvia's feet, a roly-poly caterpillar<lb>
was walking up her sleeve, a blind bird chirped on<lb>
her shoulder, bees buzzed harmlessly about her head, as if<lb>
they mistook her for a flower, and in her hand a little field<lb>
mouse was breathing its short life away. Any tender-hearted<lb>
girl might have stood thus surrounded by helpless<lb>
<pb n="033">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-038">

<figdesc>Page 033.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
things that pity had endeared, but few would have regarded<lb>
them with an expression like that which Sylvia wore.<lb>
Figure, posture, and employment were so childlike in their<lb>
innocent unconsciousness, that the contrast was all the more<lb>
strongly marked between them and the sweet thoughtfulness<lb>
that made her face singularly attractive with the charm of<lb>
dawning womanhood. Moor spoke before Mark could dispose<lb>
of his smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great improvement upon the boudoir full of<lb>
lap-dogs, worsted-work and novels, Miss Sylvia. May I<lb>
ask if you feel no repugnance to some of your patients;<lb>
or is your charity strong enough to beautify them all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dislike many people, but few animals, because however<lb>
ugly I pity them, and whatever I pity I am sure to<lb>
love. It may be silly, but I think it does me good; and<lb>
till I am wise enough to help my fellow-beings, I try to do<lb>
my duty to these humbler sufferers, and find them both<lb>
grateful and affectionate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something very winning in the girl's manner<lb>
as she spoke, touching the little creature in her hand almost<lb>
as tenderly as if it had been a child. It showed the newcomer<lb>
another phase of this many-sided character; and<lb>
while Sylvia related the histories of her pets at his request,<lb>
he was enjoying that finer history which every ingenuous<lb>
soul writes on its owner's countenance for gifted eyes to<lb>
read and love. As she paused, the little mouse lay stark<lb>
and still in her gentle hand; and though they smiled at<lb>
themselves, both young men felt like boys again as they<lb>
helped her scoop a grave among the panzies, owning the<lb>
beauty of compassion, though she showed it to them in<lb>
such a simple shape.</p>
<p>Then Mark delivered his message, and Sylvia went away<lb>
<pb n="034">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-039">

<figdesc>Page 034.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to receive Prue's lecture, with outward meekness, but such<lb>
an absent mind that the words of wisdom went by her like<lb>
the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come and take our twilight stroll, while Mark<lb>
keeps Mr. Moor in the studio and Prue prepares another<lb>
exhortation,&rdquo; said Sylvia, as her father woke, and taking<lb>
his arm, they paced along the wide piazza that encircled<lb>
the whole house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will father do me a little favor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all he lives for, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then his life is a very successful one;&rdquo; and the girl<lb>
folded her other hand over that already on his arm. Mr.<lb>
Yule shook his head with a regretful sigh, but asked benignly&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do for my little daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forbid Mark to execute a plot with which he threatens<lb>
me. He says he will bring every gentleman he knows (and<lb>
that is a great many) to the house, and make it so agreeable<lb>
that they will keep coming; for he insists that I need<lb>
amusement, and nothing will be so entertaining as a lover<lb>
or two. Please tell him not to, for I don't want any lovers<lb>
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked her father, much amused at her<lb>
twilight confidences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm afraid. Love is so cruel to some people, I feel as<lb>
if it would be to me, for I am always in extremes, and continually<lb>
going wrong while trying to go right. Love bewilders<lb>
the wisest, and it would make me quite blind or<lb>
mad, I know; therefore I'd rather have nothing to do with<lb>
it for a long, long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mark shall be forbidden to bring a single specimen.<lb>
I very much prefer to keep you as you are. And<lb>
<pb n="035">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-040">

<figdesc>Page 035.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
yet you may be happier to do as others do; try it, if you<lb>
like, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can't do as others do; I've tried, and failed.<lb>
Last winter, when Prue made me go about, though people<lb>
probably thought me a stupid little thing, moping in corners,<lb>
I was enjoying myself in my own way, and making<lb>
discoveries that have been very useful ever since. I know<lb>
I'm whimsical, and hard to please, and have no doubt the<lb>
fault was in myself, but I was disappointed in nearly every<lb>
one I met, though I went into what Prue calls `our best<lb>
society.' The girls seemed all made on the same pattern;<lb>
they all said, did, thought, and wore about the same things,<lb>
and knowing one was as good as knowing a dozen. Jessie<lb>
Hope was the only one I cared much for, and she is so<lb>
pretty, she seems made to be looked at and loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find the young gentlemen, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still worse; for, though lively enough among themselves,<lb>
they never found it worth their while to offer us any<lb>
conversation but such as was very like the champagne and<lb>
ice-cream they brought us, &mdash; sparkling, sweet, and unsubstantial.<lb>
Almost all of them wore the superior air they put<lb>
on before women, an air that says as plainly as words, `I<lb>
may ask you and I may not.' Now that is very exasperating<lb>
to those who care no more for them than so many grasshoppers,<lb>
and I often longed to take the conceit out of them<lb>
by telling some of the criticisms passed upon them by the<lb>
amiable young ladies who looked as if waiting to say meekly,<lb>
`Yes, thank you.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't excite yourself, my dear; it is all very lamentable<lb>
and laughable, but we must submit till the world learns<lb>
better. There are often excellent young persons among the<lb>
`grasshoppers,' and if you cared to look you might find a<lb>
<pb n="036">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-041">

<figdesc>Page 036.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
pleasant friend here and there,&rdquo; said Mr. Yule, leaning<lb>
a little toward his son's view of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot even do that without being laughed at;<lb>
for no sooner do I mention the word friendship than people<lb>
nod wisely and look as if they said, `Oh, yes, every one<lb>
knows what that sort of thing amounts to.' I should like<lb>
a friend, father; some one beyond home, because he would<lb>
be newer; a man (old or young, I don't care which), because<lb>
men go where they like, see things with their own<lb>
eyes, and have more to tell if they choose. I want a person<lb>
simple, wise, and entertaining; and I think I should make<lb>
a very grateful friend if such an one was kind enough to<lb>
like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would, and perhaps if you try to be more<lb>
like others you will find friends as they do, and so be happy,<lb>
Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot be like others, and their friendships would<lb>
not satisfy me. I don't try to be odd; I long to be quiet<lb>
and satisfied, but I cannot; and when I do what Prue calls<lb>
wild things, it is not because I am thoughtless or idle, but<lb>
because I am trying to be good and happy. The old ways<lb>
fail, so I attempt new ones, hoping they will succeed; but<lb>
they don't, and I still go looking and longing for happiness,<lb>
yet always failing to find it, till sometimes I think I am a<lb>
born disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps love would bring the happiness, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm afraid not; but, however that may be, I shall<lb>
never go running about for a lover as half my mates do.<lb>
When the true one comes I shall know him, love him at<lb>
once, and cling to him forever, no matter what may happen.<lb>
Till then I want a friend, and I will find one if I can.<lb>
Don't you believe there may be real and simple friendships<lb>

<milestn unit="collation" n="4">
between men and women without falling into this everlasting<lb>
sea of love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Yule was laughing quietly under cover of the darkness,<lb>
but composed himself to answer gravely &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for some of the most beautiful and famous friendships<lb>
have been such, and I see no reason why there may<lb>
not be again. Look about, Sylvia, make yourself happy;<lb>
and, whether you find friend or lover, remember there is<lb>
always the old Papa glad to do his best for you in both<lb>
capacities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia's hand crept to her father's shoulder, and her voice<lb>
was full of daughterly affection, as she said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll have no lover but `the old Pupa' for a long while<lb>
yet. But I will look about, and if I am fortunate enough<lb>
to find and good enough to keep the person I want, I shall<lb>
be very happy; for, father, I really think I need a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mark called his sister in to sing to them, a demand<lb>
that would have been refused but for a promise to Prue to<lb>
behave her best as an atonement for past pranks. Stepping<lb>
in she sat down and gave Moor another surprise, as from<lb>
her slender throat there came a voice whose power and<lb>
pathos made a tragedy of the simple ballad she was singing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you choose that plaintive thing, all about<lb>
love, despair, and death? It quite breaks one's heart to<lb>
hear it,&rdquo; said Prue, pausing in a mental estimate of her<lb>
morning's shopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came into my head, and so I sung it. Now I'll try<lb>
another, for I am bound to please you &mdash; if I can.&rdquo; And<lb>
she broke out again with an airy melody as jubilant as if a<lb>
lark had mistaken moonlight for the dawn and soared skyward,<lb>
singing as it went. So blithe and beautiful were<lb>
both voice and song they caused a sigh of pleasure, a<lb>
<pb n="038">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-043">

<figdesc>Page 038.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sensation of keen delight in the listener, and seemed to gift<lb>
the singer with an unsuspected charm. As she ended<lb>
Sylvia turned about, and seeing the satisfaction of their<lb>
guest in his face, prevented him from expressing it in words<lb>
by saying, in her frank way &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the compliments. I know my voice is<lb>
good, for that you may thank nature; that it is well trained,<lb>
for that praise Herr Pedalsturm; and that you have heard<lb>
it at all, you owe to my desire to atone for certain trespasses<lb>
of yesterday and to-day, because I seldom sing before<lb>
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to offer my hearty thanks to Nature, Pedalsturm,<lb>
and Penitence, and also to hope that in time I may<lb>
be regarded, not as a stranger, but a neighbor and a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the gentle emphasis of the last word struck<lb>
pleasantly on the girl's ear, and seemed to answer an unspoken<lb>
longing. She looked up at him with a searching<lb>
glance, appeared to find some `assurance given by looks,'<lb>
and as a smile broke over her face she offered her hand as<lb>
if obeying a sudden impulse, and said, half to him, half to<lb>
herself &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have found the friend already.&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sylvia</hi> sat sewing in the sunshine with an expression on<lb>
her face half mirthful, half melancholy, as she looked<lb>
backward to the girlhood just ended, and forward to the<lb>
womanhood just beginning, for on that midsummer day, she<lb>
was eighteen. Voices roused her from her reverie, and, looking<lb>
up, she saw her brother approaching with two friends,<lb>
their neighbor Geoffrey Moor and his guest Adam Warwick.<lb>
Her first impulse was to throw down her work and run to<lb>
meet them, her second to remember her new dignity and sit<lb>
still, awaiting them with well-bred composure, quite unconcious<lb>
that the white figure among the vines added a picturesque<lb>
finish to the quiet summer scene.</p>
<p>They came up warm and merry, with a brisk row across<lb>
the bay, and Sylvia met them with a countenance that gave<lb>
a heartier welcome than her words, as se greeted the<lb>
neighbor cordially, the stranger courteously, and began to<lb>
gather up her work when they seated themselves in the bamboo<lb>
chairs scattered about the wide piazza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not disturb yourself,&rdquo; said Mark, &ldquo;we are only<lb>
making this a way-station, <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for the studio. Can<lb>
you tell me where my knapsack is to be found? after one<lb>
of Prue's stowages, nothing short of a divining-rod will<lb>
discover it, I'm afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="040">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-045">

<figdesc>Page 040.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where it is. Are you going away again so soon,<lb>
Mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a two days' trip up the river with these mates of<lb>
mine. No, Sylvia, it can't be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in words, but you looked a whole volley of `Can't<lb>
I goes?' and I answered it. No girl but you would dream<lb>
of such a thing; you hate picnics, and as this will be a long<lb>
and rough one, don't you see how absurd it would be for<lb>
you to try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't quite see it, Mark, for this would not be an ordinary<lb>
picnic; it would be like a little romance to me, and<lb>
I had rather have it than any birthday present you could<lb>
give me. We used to have such happy times together<lb>
before we were grown up, I don't like to be so separated now.<lb>
But if it is not best, I'm sorry that I even looked a wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia tried to keep both disappointment and desire out<lb>
of her voice as she spoke, though a most intense longing had<lb>
taken possession of her when she heard of a projected pleasure<lb>
so entirely after her own heart. But there was an<lb>
unconscious reproach in her last words, a mute appeal in<lb>
the wistful eyes that looked across the glittering bay to the<lb>
green hills beyond. Now, Mark was both fond and proud of<lb>
the young sister, who, while he was studying art abroad,<lb>
had studied nature at home, till the wayward but winning<lb>
child had bloomed into a most attractive girl. He remembered<lb>
her devotion to him, his late neglect of her, and<lb>
longed to make atonement. With elevated eyebrows and<lb>
inquiring glances, he turned from one friend to another.<lb>
Moor nodded and smiled, Warwick nodded and sighed privately,<lb>
and having taken the sense of the meeting by a new<lb>
style of vote, Mark suddenly announced &mdash;</p>
<pb n="041">

<milestn unit="collation" n="4 *">
<p>&ldquo;You can go if you like, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried his sister, starting up with a characteristic<lb>
impetuosity that sent her basket tumbling down the<lb>
steps, and crowned her dozing cat with Prue's nightcap<lb>
frills. &ldquo;Do you mean it, Mark? Would n't it spoil your<lb>
pleasure, Mr. Moor? Should n't I be a trouble, Mr. Warwick?<lb>
Tell me frankly, for if I can go I shall be happier<lb>
than I can express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentlemen smiled at her eagerness, but as they saw<lb>
the altered face she turned toward them, each felt already<lb>
repaid for any loss of freedom they might experience hereafter,<lb>
and gave unanimous consent. Upon receipt of which<lb>
Sylvia felt inclined to dance about the three and bless them<lb>
audibly, but restrained herself, and beamed upon them in<lb>
a state of wordless gratitude pleasant to behold. Having<lb>
given a rash consent, Mark now thought best to offer a few<lb>
obstacles to enhance its value and try his sister's mettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't ascend into the air like a young balloon, child,<lb>
but hear the conditions upon which you go, for if you fail<lb>
to work three miracles it is all over with you. Firstly, the<lb>
consent of the higher powers, for father will dread all sorts<lb>
of dangers you are such a frcakish creature, and Prue will<lb>
be scandalized because trips like this are not the fashion for<lb>
young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider that point settled and go on to the next,&rdquo; said<lb>
Sylvia, who, having ruled the house ever since she was<lb>
born, had no fears of success with either father or sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secondly, you must do yourself up in as compact a<lb>
parcel as possible; for though you little women are very<lb>
ornamental on land, you are not very convenient for transportation<lb>
by water. Cambric gowns and French slippers<lb>
are highly appropriate and agreeable at the present moment,<lb>
<pb n="042">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-047">

<figdesc>Page 042.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
but must be sacrificed to the stern necessities of the case.<lb>
You must make a dowdy of yourself in some usefully short,<lb>
scant, dingy costume, which will try the nerves of all<lb>
beholders, and triumphantly prove that women were never<lb>
meant for such excursions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait five minutes and I'll triumphantly prove to the<lb>
contrary,&rdquo; answered Sylvia, as she ran into the house.</p>
<p>Her five minutes was sufficiently elastic to cover fifteen,<lb>
for she was ravaging her wardrobe to effect her purpose<lb>
and convince her brother, whose artistic tastes she consulted,<lb>
with a skill that did her good service in the end.<lb>
Rapidly assuming a gray gown, with a jaunty jacket of the<lb>
same, she kilted the skirt over one of green, the pedestrian<lb>
length of which displayed boots of uncompromising thickness.<lb>
Over her shoulder, by a broad ribbon, she slung a<lb>
prettily wrought pouch, and ornamented her hat pilgrimwise<lb>
with a cockle shell. Then taking her brother's alpenstock<lb>
she crept down, and standing in the door-way presented<lb>
a little figure all in gray and green, like the earth<lb>
she was going to wander over, and a face that blushed and<lb>
smiled and shone as she asked demurely &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mark, am I picturesque and convenient enough<lb>
to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wheeled about and stared approvingly, forgetting<lb>
cause in effect till Warwick began to laugh like a merry<lb>
bass viol, and Moor joined him, saying &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mark, own that you are conquered, and let us<lb>
turn our commonplace voyage into a pleasure pilgrimage,<lb>
with a lively lady to keep us knights and gentlemen<lb>
wherever we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say no more; only remember, Sylvia, if you get<lb>
burnt, drowned, or blown away, I'm not responsible for the<lb>
<pb n="043">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-048">

<figdesc>Page 043.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
damage, and shall have the satisfaction of saying, `There,<lb>
I told you so.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;That satisfaction may be mine when I come home quite<lb>
safe and well,&rdquo; replied Sylvia, serenely. &ldquo;Now for the last<lb>
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick looked with interest from the sister to the<lb>
brother; for, being a solitary man, domestic scenes and<lb>
relations possessed the charm of novelty to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirdly, you are not to carry a boat-load of luggage,<lb>
cloaks, pillows, silver forks, or a dozen napkins, but are to<lb>
fare as we fare, sleeping in hammocks, barns, or on the<lb>
bare ground, without shricking at bats or bewailing the<lb>
want of mosquito netting; eating when, where, and what is<lb>
most convenient, and facing all kinds of weather regardless<lb>
of complexion, dishevelment, and fatigue. If you can<lb>
promise all this, be here loaded and ready to go off at six<lb>
o'clock to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After which cheerful picture of the joys to come, Mark<lb>
marched away to his studio, taking his friends with him.</p>
<p>Sylvia worked the three miracles, and at half past five,<lb>
A. M. was discovered sitting on the piazza, with her hammock<lb>
rolled into a twine sausage at her feet, her hat firmly<lb>
tied on, her scrip packed, and her staff in her hand.<lb>
&ldquo;Waiting till called for,&rdquo; she said, as her brother passed<lb>
her, late and yawning as usual. As the clock struck six<lb>
the carriage drove round, and Moor and Warwick came up<lb>
the avenue in nautical array. Then arose a delightful<lb>
clamor of voices, slamming of doors, hurrying of feet and<lb>
frequent peals of laughter; for every one was in holiday<lb>
spirits, and the morning seemed made for pleasuring.</p>
<p>Mr. Yule regarded the voyagers with an aspect as benign<lb>
as the summer sky overhead; Prue ran to and fro pouring<lb>
<pb n="044">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-049">

<figdesc>Page 044.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
forth a stream of counsels, warnings, and predictions; men<lb>
and maids gathered on the lawn or hung out of upper windows;<lb>
and even old Hecate, the cat, was seen chasing imaginary<lb>
rats and mice in the grass till her yellow eyes<lb>
glared with excitement. &ldquo;All in,&rdquo; was announced at last,<lb>
and as the carriage rolled away its occupants looked at one<lb>
another with faces of blithe satisfaction that their pilgrimage<lb>
was so auspiciously begun.</p>
<p>A mile or more up the river the large, newly-painted<lb>
boat awaited them. The embarkation was a speedy one,<lb>
for the cargo was soon stowed in lockers and under seats,<lb>
Sylvia forwarded to her place in the bow; Mark, as commander<lb>
of the craft, took the helm; Moor and Warwick,<lb>
as crew, sat waiting orders; and Hugh, the coachman,<lb>
stood ready to push off at word of command. Presently it<lb>
came, a strong hand sent them rustling through the flags,<lb>
down dropped the uplifted oars, and with a farewell cheer<lb>
from a group upon the shore the Kelpie glided out into the<lb>
stream.</p>
<p>Sylvia, too full of genuine content to talk, sat listening<lb>
to the musical dip of well-pulled oars, watching the green<lb>
banks on either side, dabbling her hands in the eddies as<lb>
they rippled by, and singing to the wind, as cheerful and<lb>
serene as the river that gave her back a smiling image of<lb>
herself. What her companions talked of she neither heard<lb>
nor cared to know, for she was looking at the great picturebook<lb>
that always lies ready for the turning of the youngest<lb>
or the oldest hands; was receiving the welcome of the playmates<lb>
she best loved, and was silently yielding herself to<lb>
the power which works all wonders with its benignant<lb>
magic. Hour after hour she journeyed along that fluent<lb>
road. Under bridges where early fishers lifted up their<lb>
<pb n="045">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-050">

<figdesc>Page 045.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
lines to let them through; past gardens tilled by unskilful<lb>
townsmen who harvested an hour of strength to pay the<lb>
daily tax the city levied on them; past honeymoon cottages<lb>
where young wives walked with young husbands in the<lb>
dew, or great houses shut against the morning. Lovers<lb>
came floating down the stream with masterless rudder and<lb>
trailing oars. College race-boats shot by with modern<lb>
Greek choruses in full blast and the frankest criticisms from<lb>
their scientific crews. Fathers went rowing to and fro with<lb>
argosies of pretty children, who gave them gay good morrows.<lb>
Sometimes they met fanciful nutshells manned by<lb>
merry girls, who made for shore at sight of them with most<lb>
erratic movements and novel commands included in their<lb>
Art of Navigation. Now and then some poet or philosopher<lb>
went musing by, fishing for facts or fictions, where<lb>
other men catch pickerel or perch.</p>
<p>All manner of sights and sounds greeted Sylvia, and she<lb>
felt as if she were watching a Panorama painted in water<lb>
colors by an artist who had breathed into his work the<lb>
breath of life and given each figure power to play its part.<lb>
Never had human faces looked so lovely to her eye, for<lb>
morning beautified the plainest with its ruddy kiss; never<lb>
had human voices sounded so musical to her ear, for daily<lb>
cares had not yet brought discord to the instruments tuned<lb>
by sleep and touched by sunshine into pleasant sound;<lb>
never had the whole race seemed so near and dear to her,<lb>
for she was unconsciously pledging all she met in that<lb>
genuine Elixir Vit&aelig; which sets the coldest blood aglow<lb>
and makes the whole world kin; never had she felt so<lb>
truly her happiest self, for of all the costlier pleasures she<lb>
had known not one had been so congenial as this, as she<lb>
rippled farther and farther up the stream and seemed to<lb>
<pb n="046">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-051">

<figdesc>Page 046.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
float into a world whose airs brought only health and peace.<lb>
Her comrades wisely left her to her thoughts, a smiling<lb>
Silence for their figure-head, and none among them but<lb>
found the day fairer and felt himself fitter to enjoy it for<lb>
the innocent companionship of maidenhood and a happy<lb>
heart.</p>
<p>At noon they dropped anchor under a wide-spreading<lb>
oak that stood on the river's edge, a green tent for wanderers<lb>
like themselves; there they ate their first meal spread<lb>
among white clovers, with a pair of squirrels staring at<lb>
them as curiously as human spectators ever watched royalty<lb>
at dinner, while several meek cows courteously left their<lb>
guests the shade and went away to dine at a side-table<lb>
spread in the sun. They spent an hour or two talking or<lb>
drowsing luxuriously on the grass; then the springing up<lb>
of a fresh breeze roused them all, and weighing anchor they<lb>
set sail for another port.</p>
<p>Now Sylvia saw new pictures, for, leaving all traces of the<lb>
city behind them, they went swiftly countryward. Sometimes<lb>
by hayfields, each an idyl in itself, with white-sleeved<lb>
mowers all arow; the pleasant sound of whetted scythes;<lb>
great loads rumbling up lanes, with brown-faced children<lb>
shouting atop; rosy girls raising fragrant winrows or bringing<lb>
water for thirsty sweethearts leaning on their rakes. Often<lb>
they saw ancient farm-houses with mossy roofs, and long<lb>
well-sweeps suggestive of fresh draughts, and the drip of<lb>
brimming pitchers; orchards and cornfields rustling on either<lb>
hand, and grandmotherly caps at the narrow windows, or stout<lb>
matrons tending babies in the doorway as they watched<lb>
smaller selves playing keep house under the &ldquo;laylocks&rdquo;<lb>
by the wall. Villages, like white flocks, slept on the hillsides;<lb>
martinbox schoolhouses appeared here and there,<lb>
<pb n="047">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-052">

<figdesc>Page 047.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
astir with busy voices, alive with wistful eyes; and more<lb>
than once they came upon little mermen bathing, who dived<lb>
with sudden splashes, like a squad of turtles tumbling off a<lb>
sunny rock.</p>
<p>Then they went floating under vernal arches, where<lb>
a murmurous rustle seemed to whisper, &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; along<lb>
shadowless sweeps, where the blue turned to gold and dazzled<lb>
with its unsteady shimmer; passed islands so full of<lb>
birds they seemed green cages floating in the sun, or doubled<lb>
capes that opened long vistas of light and shade, through<lb>
which they sailed into the pleasant land where summer<lb>
reigned supreme. To Sylvia it seemed as if the inhabitants<lb>
of these solitudes had flocked down to the shore to greet<lb>
her as she came. Fleets of lilies unfurled their sails on<lb>
either hand, and cardinal flowers waved their scarlet flags<lb>
among the green. The sagitaria lifted its blue spears from<lb>
arrowy leaves; wild roses smiled at her with blooming<lb>
faces; meadow lilies rang their flame-colored bells; and<lb>
clematis and ivy hung garlands everywhere, as if hers were<lb>
a floral progress, and each came to do her honor.</p>
<p>Her neighbors kept up a flow of conversation as steady<lb>
as the river's, and Sylvia listened now. Insensibly the<lb>
changeful scenes before them recalled others, and in the<lb>
friendly atmosphere that surrounded them these reminiscences<lb>
found free expression. Each of the three had been<lb>
fortunate in seeing much of foreign life; each had seen a<lb>
different phase of it, and all were young enough to be still<lb>
enthusiastic, accomplished enough to serve up their recollections<lb>
with taste and skill, and give Sylvia glimpses of the<lb>
world through spectacles sufficiently rose-colored to lend it<lb>
the warmth which even Truth allows to her sister Romance.</p>
<p>The wind served them till sunset, then the sail was<lb>
<pb n="048">

</eaffig>
lowered and the rowers took to their oars. Sylvia demanded<lb>
her turn, and wrestled with one big oar while Warwick sat<lb>
behind and did the work. Having blistered her hands and<lb>
given herself as fine a color as any on her brother's palette,<lb>
she professed herself satisfied, and went back to her seat<lb>
to watch the evening-red transfigure earth and sky, making<lb>
the river and its banks a more royal pageant than<lb>
splendor-loving Elizabeth ever saw along the Thames.</p>
<p>Anxious to reach a certain point, they rowed on into the<lb>
twilight, growing stiller and stiller as the deepening hush<lb>
seemed to hint that Nature was at her prayers. Slowly the<lb>
Kelpie floated along the shadowy way, and as the shores<lb>
grew dim, the river dark with leaning hemlocks or an overhanging<lb>
cliff, Sylvia felt as if she were making the last<lb>
voyage across that fathomless stream where a pale boatman<lb>
plies and many go lamenting.</p>
<p>The long silence was broken first by Moor's voice, saying &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam, sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the influences of the hour had calmed Mark, touched<lb>
Sylvia, and made Moor long for music, they had also softened<lb>
Warwick. Leaning on his oar he lent the music of a<lb>
mellow voice to the words of a German Volksleid, and<lb>
launched a fleet of echoes such as any tuneful vintager<lb>
might have sent floating down the Rhine. Sylvia was no<lb>
weeper, but as she listened, all the day's happiness which<lb>
had been pent up in her heart found vent in sudden tears,<lb>
that streamed down noiseless and refreshing as a warm<lb>
south rain. Why they came she could not tell, for neither<lb>
song nor singer possessed the power to win so rare a<lb>
tribute, and at another time, she would have restrained all<lb>
visible expression of this indefinable yet sweet emotion.<lb>
Mark and Moor had joined in the burden of the song, and<lb>
<pb n="049">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-054">

<figdesc>Page 049.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="5">
when that was done took up another; but Sylvia only<lb>
sat and let her tears flow while they would, singing at<lb>
heart, though her eyes were full and her cheeks wet faster<lb>
than the wind could kiss them dry.</p>
<p>After frequent peerings and tackings here and there,<lb>
Mark at last discovered the haven he desired, and with<lb>
much rattling of oars, clanking of chains, and splashing<lb>
of impetuous boots, a landing was effected, and Sylvia<lb>
found herself standing on a green bank with her hammock<lb>
in her arms and much wonderment in her mind whether the<lb>
nocturnal experiences in store for her would prove as agreeable<lb>
as the daylight ones had been. Mark and Moor unloaded<lb>
the boat and prospected for an eligible sleeping-place.<lb>
Warwick, being an old campaigner, set about building a<lb>
fire, and the girl began her sylvan housekeeping. The<lb>
scene rapidly brightened into light and color as the blaze<lb>
sprang up, showing the little kettle slung gipsywise on<lb>
forked sticks, and the supper prettily set forth in a leafy<lb>
table-service on a smooth, flat stone. Soon four pairs of<lb>
wet feet surrounded the fire; an agreeable oblivion of <hi rend="italics">meum</hi><lb>
and <hi rend="italics">tuum</hi> concerning plates, knives, and cups did away with<lb>
etiquette, and every one was in a comfortable state of weariness,<lb>
which rendered the thought of bed so pleasant that<lb>
they deferred their enjoyment of the reality, as children<lb>
keep the best bite till the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of here all by yourself?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Mark, coming to lounge on his sister's plaid, which she had<lb>
spread somewhat apart from the others, and where she sat<lb>
watching the group before her with a dreamy aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was watching your two friends. See what a fine study<lb>
they make with the red flicker of the fire on their faces and<lb>
the background of dark pines behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="050">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-055">

<figdesc>Page 050.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>They did make a fine study, for both were goodly men<lb>
yet utterly unlike, one being of the heroic type, the other<lb>
of the poetic. Warwick was a head taller than his tall<lb>
friend, broad-shouldered, strong-limbed, and bronzed by<lb>
wind and weather. A massive head, covered with rings of<lb>
ruddy brown hair, gray eyes, that seemed to pierce through<lb>
all disguises, an eminent nose, and a beard like one of<lb>
Mark's stout saints. Power, intellect, and courage were<lb>
stamped on face and figure, making him the manliest man<lb>
that Sylvia had ever seen. He leaned against the stone,<lb>
yet nothing could have been less reposeful than his attitude,<lb>
for the native unrest of the man asserted itself in spite of<lb>
weariness or any soothing influence of time or place. Moor<lb>
was much slighter, and betrayed in every gesture the unconscious<lb>
grace of the gentleman born. A most attractive<lb>
face, with its broad brow, serene eyes, and the cordial smile<lb>
about the mouth. A sweet, strong nature, one would say,<lb>
which, having used life well had learned the secret of a<lb>
true success. Inward tranquillity seemed his, and it was<lb>
plain to see that no wave of sound, no wandering breath,<lb>
no glimpse of color, no hint of night or nature was without<lb>
its charm and its significance for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about that man, Mark. I have heard you speak<lb>
of him since you came home, but supposing he was some<lb>
blowzy artist, I never cared to ask about him. Now I've<lb>
seen him, I want to know more,&rdquo; said Sylvia, as her brother<lb>
laid himself down after an approving glance at the group<lb>
opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him in Munich, when I first went abroad, and<lb>
since then we have often come upon each other in our wanderings.<lb>
He never writes, but goes and comes intent upon<lb>
his own affairs; yet one never can forget him, and is always<lb>
<pb n="051">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-056">

<figdesc>Page 051.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
glad to feel the grip of his hand again, it seems to put such<lb>
life and courage into one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he good? asked Sylvia, woman like, beginning with<lb>
the morals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violently virtuous. He is a masterful soul, bent on<lb>
living out his beliefs and aspirations at any cost. Much<lb>
given to denunciation of wrong-doing everywhere, and eager<lb>
to execute justice upon all offenders high or low. Yet he<lb>
possesses great nobility of character, great audacity of mind,<lb>
and leads a life of the sternest integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his own eyes, because he makes his wants so few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he has no family, and not many friends, for he<lb>
says what he means in the bluntest English, and few stand<lb>
the test his sincerity applies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he do in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Studies it, as we do books; dives into everything, analyzes<lb>
character, and builds up his own with materials which<lb>
will last. If that 's not genius it 's something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he will do much good and be famous, wont he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great good to many, but never will be famous, I fear.<lb>
He is too fierce an iconoclast to suit the old party, too individual<lb>
a reformer to join the new, and being born a century<lb>
too soon must bide his time, or play out his part before stage<lb>
and audience are ready for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, in uncommon sorts of wisdom; left college after<lb>
a year of it, because it could not give him what he wanted,<lb>
and taking the world for his university, life for his tutor,<lb>
says he shall not graduate till his term ends with days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I shall like him very much.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="052">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, for my sake. He is a grand man in the rough,<lb>
and an excellent tonic for those who have courage to try<lb>
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia was silent, thinking over all she had just heard<lb>
and finding much to interest her in it, because, to her imaginative<lb>
and enthusiastic nature, there was something<lb>
irresistibly attractive in the strong, solitary, self-reliant<lb>
man. Mark watched her for a moment, then asked with<lb>
lazy curiosity &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like this other friend of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went away when I was such a child that since he<lb>
came back I've had to begin again; but if I like him at the<lb>
end of another month as much as I do now, I shall try to<lb>
make your friend my friend, because I need such an one<lb>
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark laughed at the innocent frankness of his sister's<lb>
speech but took it as she meant it, and answered soberly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better leave Platonics till you 're forty. Though Moor<lb>
is twelve years older than yourself he is a young man still,<lb>
and you are grown a very captivating little woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked both scornful and indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need have no fears. There <hi rend="italics">is</hi> such a thing as<lb>
true and simple friendship between men and women, and<lb>
if I can find no one of my own sex who can give me the help<lb>
and happiness I want, why may I not look for it anywhere<lb>
and accept it in whatever shape it comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may, my dear, and I'll lend a hand with all my<lb>
heart, but you must be willing to take the consequences in<lb>
whatever shape <hi rend="italics">they</hi> come,&rdquo; said Mark, not ill pleased with<lb>
the prospect his fancy conjured up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Sylvia loftily, and fate took her at her<lb>
word.</p>
<pb n="053">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-058">

<figdesc>Page 053.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="5 *">
<p>Presently some one suggested bed, and the proposition<lb>
was unanimously accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to hang me?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, as<lb>
she laid hold of her hammock and looked about her with<lb>
nearly as much interest as if her suspension was to be of<lb>
the perpendicular order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to be swung up in a tree to-night but laid<lb>
like a ghost, and requested not to walk till morning. There<lb>
is an unused barn close by, so we shall have a roof over us<lb>
for one night longer,&rdquo; answered Mark, playing chamberlain<lb>
while the others remained to quench the fire and secure the<lb>
larder.</p>
<p>An early moon lighted Sylvia to bed, and when shown<lb>
her half the barn, which, as she was a Marine, was very<lb>
properly the bay, Mark explained she scouted the idea of<lb>
being nervous or timid in such rude quarters, made herself<lb>
a cosy nest and bade her brother a merry good night.</p>
<p>More weary than she would confess, Sylvia fell asleep at<lb>
once, despite the novelty of her situation and the noises<lb>
that fill a summer night with fitful rustlings and tones.<lb>
How long she slept she did not know, but woke suddenly<lb>
and sat erect with that curious thrill which sometimes<lb>
startles one out of deepest slumber, and is often the forerunner<lb>
of some dread or danger. She felt this hot tingle<lb>
through blood and nerves, and stared about her thinking of<lb>
fire. But everything was dark and still, and after waiting<lb>
a few moments she decided that her nest had been too warm,<lb>
for her temples throbbed and her cheeks were feverish with<lb>
the close air of the barn half filled with new-made hay.</p>
<p>Creeping up a fragrant slope she spread her plaid again<lb>
and lay down where a cool breath flowed through wide<lb>
chinks in the wall. Sleep was slowly returning when the<lb>
<pb n="054">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-059">

<figdesc>Page 054.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
rustle of footsteps scared it quite away and set her heart<lb>
beating fast, for they came toward the new couch she had<lb>
chosen. Holding her breath she listened. The quiet tread<lb>
drew nearer and nearer till it paused within a yard of her,<lb>
then some one seemed to throw themselves down, sigh heavily<lb>
a few times and grow still as if falling asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Mark,&rdquo; thought Sylvia, and whispered his name, but<lb>
no one answered, and from the other corner of the barn she<lb>
heard her brother muttering in his sleep. Who was it,<lb>
then? Mark had said there were no cattle near, she was<lb>
sure neither of her comrades had left their bivouac, for<lb>
there was her brother talking as usual in his dreams; some<lb>
one seemed restless and turned often with decided motion,<lb>
that was Warwick, she thought, while the quietest sleeper<lb>
of the three betrayed his presence by laughing once with<lb>
the low-toned merriment she recognized as Moor's. These<lb>
discoveries left her a prey to visions of grimy strollers,<lb>
maudlin farm-servants, and infectious emigrants in dismal<lb>
array. A strong desire to cry out possessed her for a moment,<lb>
but was checked; for with all her sensitiveness Sylvia<lb>
had much common sense, and that spirit which hates to be<lb>
conquered even by a natural fear. She remembered her<lb>
scornful repudiation of the charge of timidity, and the<lb>
endless jokes she would have to undergo if her mysterious<lb>
neighbor should prove some harmless wanderer or an imaginary<lb>
terror of her own, so she held her peace, thinking<lb>
valiantly as the drops gathered on her forehead, and every<lb>
sense grew painfully alert &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll not call if my hair turns gray with fright, and I<lb>
find myself an idiot to-morrow. I told them to try me, and<lb>
I wont be found wanting at the first alarm. I'll be still,<lb>
if the thing does not touch me till dawn, when I shall<lb>
<pb n="055">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-060">

<figdesc>Page 055.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
know how to act at once, and so save myself from ridicule<lb>
at the cost of a wakeful night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding fast to this resolve Sylvia lay motionless, listening<lb>
to the cricket's chirp without, and taking uncomfortable<lb>
notes of the state of things within, for the new comer stirred<lb>
heavily, sighed long and deeply, and seemed to wake often,<lb>
like one too sad or weary to rest. She would have been wise<lb>
to have screamed her scream and had the rout over, for she<lb>
tormented herself with the ingenuity of a lively fancy, and<lb>
suffered more from her own terrors than at the discovery of<lb>
a dozen vampires. Every tale of <hi rend="italics">diablerie</hi> she had ever<lb>
heard came most inopportunely to haunt her now, and<lb>
though she felt their folly she could not free herself from<lb>
their dominion. She wondered till she could wonder no<lb>
longer what the morning would show her. She tried to<lb>
calculate in how many springs she could reach and fly over<lb>
the low partition which separated her from her sleeping<lb>
body-guard. She wished with all her heart that she had<lb>
stayed in her nest which was nearer the door, and watched<lb>
for dawn with eyes that ached to see the light.</p>
<p>In the midst of these distressful sensations the far-off crow<lb>
of some vigilant chanticleer assured her that the short summer<lb>
night was wearing away and relief was at hand. This<lb>
comfortable conviction had so good an effect that she lapsed<lb>
into what seemed a moment's oblivion, but was in fact an<lb>
hour's restless sleep, for when her eyes unclosed again the<lb>
first red streaks were visible in the east, and a dim light<lb>
found its way into the barn through the great door which<lb>
had been left ajar for air. An instant Sylvia lay collecting<lb>
herself, then rose on her arm, looked resolutely behind her,<lb>
stared with round eyes a moment, and dropped down again,<lb>
laughing with a merriment, which coming on the heels of<lb>
<pb n="056">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-061">

<figdesc>Page 056.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her long alarm was rather hysterical. All she saw was a<lb>
little soft-eyed Alderney, which lifted its stag-like head, and<lb>
regarded her with a confiding aspect that won her pardon<lb>
for its innocent offence.</p>
<p>Through the relief of both mind and body which she<lb>
experienced in no small degree, the first thought that came<lb>
was a thankful &ldquo;what a mercy I did n't call Mark, for I<lb>
should never have heard the last of this;&rdquo; and having<lb>
fought her fears alone she enjoyed her success alone, and<lb>
girl-like resolved to say nothing of her first night's adventures.<lb>
Gathering herself up the crept nearer and caressed<lb>
her late terror, which stretched its neck toward her with a<lb>
comfortable sound, and munched her shawl like a cosset<lb>
lamb. But before this new friendship was many minutes<lb>
old, Sylvia's heavy lids fell together, her head dropped<lb>
lower and lower, her hand lay still on the dappled neck,<lb>
and with a long sigh of weariness she dropped back upon<lb>
the hay, leaving little Alderney to watch over her much<lb>
more tranquilly than she had watched over it.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Very</hi> early were they afloat again, and as they glided<lb>
up the stream Sylvia watched the earth's awakening, seeing<lb>
in it what her own should be. The sun was not yet visible<lb>
above the hills, but the sky was ready for his coming, with<lb>
the soft flush of color dawn gives only to her royal lover.<lb>
Birds were chanting matins as if all the jubilance of their<lb>
short lives must be poured out at once. Flowers stirred<lb>
and brightened like children after sleep. A balmy wind<lb>
came whispering from the wood, bringing the aroma of<lb>
pines, the cool breath of damp nooks, the healthful kiss<lb>
that leaves a glow behind. Light mists floated down the<lb>
river like departing visions that had haunted it by night,<lb>
and every ripple breaking on the shore seemed to sing a<lb>
musical good morrow.</p>
<p>Sylvia could not conceal the weariness her long vigil left<lb>
behind; and after betraying herself by a drowsy lurch that<lb>
nearly took her overboard, she made herself comfortable,<lb>
and slept till the grating of the keel on a pebbly shore woke<lb>
her to find a new harbor reached under the lee of a cliff,<lb>
whose deep shadow was very grateful after the glare of<lb>
noon upon the water.</p>

afternoon, Adam?&rdquo; asked Mark, when dinner was over and his<lb>
sister busy feeding the birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way,&rdquo; answered Warwick, producing a book<lb>
and settling himself in a commodious cranny of the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moor and I want to climb the cliff and sketch the<lb>
view; but it is too rough a road for Sylvia. Would you<lb>
mind mounting guard for an hour or two? Read away, and<lb>
leave her to amuse herself; only pray don't let her get into<lb>
any mischief by way of enjoying her liberty, for she fears<lb>
nothing and is fond of experiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll do my best,&rdquo; replied Warwick, with an air of resignation.<lb>
</p>
<p>Having slung the hammock and seen Sylvia safely into<lb>
it, the climbers departed, leaving her to enjoy the luxury<lb>
of motion. For half an hour she swung idly, looking up<lb>
into the green pavilion overhead, where many insect families<lb>
were busy with their small joys and cares, or out over<lb>
the still landscape basking in the warmth of a cloudless<lb>
afternoon. Then she opened a book Mark had brought for<lb>
his own amusement, and began to read as intently as her<lb>
companion, who leaned against the boulder slowly turning<lb>
his pages, with leafy shadows flickering over his uncovered<lb>
head and touching it with alternate sun and shade. The<lb>
book proved interesting, and Sylvia was rapidly skimming<lb>
into the heart of the story, when an unguarded motion<lb>
caused her swing to slope perilously to one side, and in<lb>
saving herself she lost her book. This produced a predicament,<lb>
for being helped into a hammock and getting out<lb>
alone are two very different things She eyed the distance<lb>
from her nest to the ground, and fancied it had been made<lb>
unusually great to keep her stationary. She held fast with<lb>
one hand and stretched downward with the other; but the<lb>

</eaffig>
book insolently flirted its leaves just out of reach. She<lb>
took a survey of Warwick; he had not perceived her plight,<lb>
and she felt an unwonted reluctance to call for help, because<lb>
he did not look like one used to come and go at a<lb>
woman's bidding. After several fruitless essays she decided<lb>
to hazard an ungraceful descent; and, gathering herself up,<lb>
was about to launch boldly out, when Warwick cried,<lb>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; in a tone that nearly produced the catastrophe<lb>
he wished to avert. Sylvia subsided, and coming up he<lb>
lifted the book, glanced at the title, then keenly at the<lb>
reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you allowed to read what you choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. That is Mark's choice, however; I brought<lb>
no book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advise you to skim it into the river; it is not a book<lb>
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia caught a glimpse of the one he had been reading<lb>
himself, and impelled by a sudden impulse to see what<lb>
would come of it, she answered with a look as keen as his<lb>
own &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You disapprove of my book; would you recommend<lb>
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, yes; for in one you will find much falsehood<lb>
in purple and fine linen, in the other some truth in figleaves.<lb>
Take your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered both; but Sylvia took refuge in civility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, I'll have neither; but if you will please<lb>
steady the hammock, I will try to find some more harmless<lb>
amusement for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed with one of the humorous expressions which<lb>
<pb n="060">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-065">

<figdesc>Page 060.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
often passed over his face. Sylvia descended as gracefully<lb>
as circumstances permitted, and went roving up and down<lb>
the cliffs. Warwick resumed his seat and the &ldquo;barbaric<lb>
yawp,&rdquo; but seemed to find Truth in demi-toilet less interesting<lb>
than Youth in a gray gown and round hat, for which<lb>
his taste is to be commended. The girl had small scope<lb>
for amusement, and when she had gathered moss for pillows,<lb>
laid out a white fungus to dry for a future pin-cushion,<lb>
harvested penny-royal in little sheaves tied with<lb>
grass-blades, watched a battle between black ants and red,<lb>
and learned the landscape by heart; she was at the end of<lb>
her resources, and leaning on a stone surveyed earth and<lb>
sky with a somewhat despondent air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like something to do, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir; for being rather new to this sort of life, I<lb>
have not yet learned how to dispose of my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that, and having deprived you of one employment<lb>
will try to replace it by another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick rose, and going to the single birch that glimmered<lb>
among the pines like a delicate spirit of the wood,<lb>
he presently returned with strips of silvery bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were wishing for baskets to hold your spoils, yesterday;<lb>
shall we make some now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid in me not to think of that! Yes, thank<lb>
you, I should like it very much;&rdquo; and producing her housewife,<lb>
Sylvia fell to work with a brightening face.</p>
<p>Warwick sat a little below her on the rock, shaping his<lb>
basket in perfect silence. This did not suit Sylvia, for feeling<lb>
lively and loquacious she wanted conversation to occupy<lb>
her thoughts as pleasantly as the birch rolls were occupying<lb>
her hands, and there sat a person who, she was sure, could<lb>
do it perfectly if he chose. She reconnoitered with covert<lb>
<pb n="061">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-066">

<figdesc>Page 061.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="6">
glances, made sundry overtures, and sent out envoys in the<lb>
shape of scissors, needles, and thread. But no answering<lb>
glance met hers; her remarks received the briefest replies,<lb>
and her offers of assistance were declined with an absent<lb>
&ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo; Then she grew indignant at this seeming<lb>
neglect, and thought, as she sat frowning over her work,<lb>
behind his back &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He treats me like a child, &mdash; very well, then, I'll<lb>
behave like one, and beset him with questions till he is<lb>
driven to speak; for he can talk, he ought to talk, he shall<lb>
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Warwick, do you like children?&rdquo; she began, with<lb>
a determined aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than men or women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you enjoy amusing them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exceedingly, when in the humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in the humor now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don't you amuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are not a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancied you thought me one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had, I probably should have put you on my knee,<lb>
and told you fairy tales, or cut dolls for you out of this<lb>
bark, instead of sitting respectfully silent and making a<lb>
basket for your stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a curious smile about Warwick's mouth as he<lb>
spoke, and Sylvia was rather abashed by her first exploit.<lb>
But there was a pleasure in the daring, and choosing another<lb>
topic she tried again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark was telling me last night about the great college<lb>
you had chosen; I thought it must be a very original and<lb>
interesting way to educate one's self, and wanted very much<lb>
<pb n="062">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-067">

<figdesc>Page 062.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to know what you had been studying lately. May I ask<lb>
you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men and women,&rdquo; was the brief answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got your lesson, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A part of it very thoroughly, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you think me rude if I asked which part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what conclusions do you arrive at concerning this<lb>
branch of the subject?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, smiling and interested.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it is both dangerous and unsatisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke so gravely, looked so stern, that Sylvia obeyed<lb>
a warning instinct and sat silent till she had completed a<lb>
canoe-shaped basket, the useful size of which produced<lb>
a sudden longing to fill it. Her eye had already spied a<lb>
knoll across the river covered with vines, and so suggestive<lb>
of berries that she now found it impossible to resist the desire<lb>
for an exploring trip in that direction. The boat was<lb>
too large for her to manage alone, but an enterprising spirit<lb>
had taken possession of her, and having made one voyage<lb>
of discovery with small success she resolved to try again,<lb>
hoping a second in another direction might prove more<lb>
fruitful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your basket done, sir?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; will you have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you have made it as an Indian would, using<lb>
grass instead of thread. It is much more complete than<lb>
mine, for the green stitches ornament the white bark, but<lb>
the black ones disfigure it. I should know a man made<lb>
your basket and a woman mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because one is ugly and strong, the other graceful but<lb>
unable to stand alone?&rdquo; asked Warwick, rising, with a<lb>
<pb n="063">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-068">

<figdesc>Page 063.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
gesture that sent the silvery shreds flying away on the<lb>
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One holds as much as the other, however; and I fancy<lb>
the woman would fill hers soonest if she had the wherewithal<lb>
to do it. Do you know there are berries on that<lb>
hillside opposite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see vines, but consider fruit doubtful, for boys and<lb>
birds are thicker than blackberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've a firm conviction that they have left some for us;<lb>
and as Mark says you like frankness, I think I shall venture<lb>
to ask you to row me over and help me fill the baskets on<lb>
the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked up at him with amerry mixture of doubt<lb>
and daring in her face, and offered him his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, I will,&rdquo; said Warwick, leading the way to<lb>
the boat with an alacrity which proved how much pleasanter<lb>
to him was action than repose.</p>
<p>There was no dry landing-place just opposite, and as he<lb>
rowed higher, Adam fixed his eyes on Sylvia with a look<lb>
peculiar to himself, a gaze more keen than soft, which<lb>
seemed to search one through and through with its rapid<lb>
discernment. He saw a face full of contradictions, &mdash; youthful,<lb>
maidenly, and intelligent, yet touched with the unconscious<lb>
melancholy which is born of disappointment and<lb>
desire. The mouth was sweet and tender as a woman's<lb>
should be, the brow spirited and thoughtful; but the eyes<lb>
were by turns eager, absent, or sad, and there was much<lb>
pride in the carriage of the small head with its hair of wavy<lb>
gold gathered into a green snood, whence little tendrils kept<lb>
breaking loose to dance upon her forehead, or hang about<lb>
her neck. A most significant but not a beautiful face, because<lb>
of its want of harmony. The dark eyes, among their<lb>
<pb n="064">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-069">

<figdesc>Page 064.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fair surroundings, disturbed the sight as a discord in music<lb>
jars upon the ear; even when the lips smiled the sombre<lb>
shadow of black lashes seemed to fill them with a gloom<lb>
that was never wholly lost. The voice, too, which should<lb>
have been a girlish treble, was full and low as a matured<lb>
woman's, with now and then a silvery ring to it, as if another<lb>
and a blither creature spoke.</p>
<p>Sylvia could not be offended by the grave penetration of<lb>
this glance, though an uncomfortable consciousness that<lb>
she was being analyzed and tested made her meet it with<lb>
a look intended to be dignified, but which was also somewhat<lb>
defiant, and more than one smile passed over Warwick's<lb>
countenance as he watched her. The moment the<lb>
boat glided with a soft swish among the rushes that<lb>
fringed the shore, she sprang up the bank, and leaving a<lb>
basket behind her by way of hint, hurried to the sandy<lb>
knoll, where, to her great satisfaction, she found the vines<lb>
heavy with berries. As Warwick joined her she held up<lb>
a shining cluster, saying with a touch of exultation in her<lb>
voice &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faith is rewarded; taste and believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accepted them with a nod, and said pleasantly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As my prophecy has failed, let us see if yours will be<lb>
fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept the challenge.&rdquo; And down upon her knees<lb>
went Sylvia among the vines, regardless of stains, rents, or<lb>
wounded hands.</p>
<p>Warwick strolled away to leave her &ldquo;claim&rdquo; free, and<lb>
silence fell between them; for one was too busy with<lb>
thorns, the other with thoughts, to break the summer stillness.<lb>
Sylvia worked with as much energy as if a silver<lb>
cup was to be the reward of success. The sun shone<lb>
<pb n="065">

<milestn unit="collation" n="6 *">
fervently and the wind was cut off by the hill, drops gathered<lb>
on her forehead and her cheeks glowed; but she only<lb>
pushed off her hat, thrust back her hair, and moved on to a<lb>
richer spot. Vines caught at her by sleeve and skirt as if<lb>
to dishearten the determined plunderer, but on she went<lb>
with a wrench and a rip, an impatient &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and a hasty<lb>
glance at damaged fabrics and fingers. Lively crickets<lb>
flew up in swarms about her, surly wasps disputed her<lb>
right to the fruit, and drunken bees blundered against<lb>
her as they met zigzagging homeward much the worse for<lb>
blackberry wine. She never heeded any of them, though<lb>
at another time she would gladly have made friends with<lb>
all, but found compensation for her discomforts in the busy<lb>
twitter of sand swallows perched on the mullein-tops, the<lb>
soft flight of yellow butterflies, and the rapidity with which<lb>
the little canoe received its freight of &ldquo;Ethiop sweets.&rdquo; As<lb>
the last handful went in she sprung up crying &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;<lb>
with a suddenness that broke up the Long Parliament and<lb>
sent its members skimming away as if a second &ldquo;Noll&rdquo;<lb>
had appeared among them. &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; came back Warwick's<lb>
answer like a deep echo from below, and hurrying<lb>
down to meet him she displayed her success, saying<lb>
archly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad we both won, though to be perfectly candid<lb>
I think mine is decidedly the fullest.&rdquo; But as she swung up<lb>
her birch pannier the handle broke, and down went basket,<lb>
berries and all, into the long grass rustling at her feet.</p>
<p>Warwick could not restrain a laugh at the blank dismay<lb>
that fell upon the exultation of Sylvia's face, and for a<lb>
moment she was both piqued and petulant. Hot, tired,<lb>
disappointed, and, hardest of all, laughed at, it was one of<lb>
those times that try girls' souls. But she was too old to<lb>
<pb n="066">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-071">

<figdesc>Page 066.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
cry, too proud to complain, too well-bred to resent, so the<lb>
little gust passed over unseen, she thought, and joining in<lb>
the merriment she said, as she knelt down beside the<lb>
wreck &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a practical illustration of the old proverb, and<lb>
I deserve it for my boasting. Next time I'll try to combine<lb>
strength and beauty in my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To wise people character is betrayed by trifles. Warwick<lb>
stopped laughing, and something about the girlish<lb>
figure in the grass, regathering with wounded hands the<lb>
little harvest lately lost, seemed to touch him. His face<lb>
softened suddenly as he collected several broad leaves,<lb>
spread them on the grass, and sitting down by Sylvia,<lb>
looked under her hat-brim with a glance of mingled penitence<lb>
and friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young philosopher, pile up your berries in that<lb>
green platter while I repair the basket. Bear this in mind<lb>
when you work in bark: make your handle the way of the<lb>
grain, and choose a strip both smooth and broad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then drawing out his knife he fell to work, and while<lb>
he tied green withes, as if the task were father to the<lb>
thought, he told her something of a sojourn among the<lb>
Indians, of whom he had learned much concerning their<lb>
woodcraft, arts, and superstitions; lengthening the legend<lb>
till the little canoe was ready for another launch. With<lb>
her fancy full of war-trails and wampum. Sylvia followed<lb>
to the river-side, and as they floated back dabbled her<lb>
stained fingers in the water, comforting their smart with<lb>
its cool flow till they swept by the landing-place, when she<lb>
asked, wonderingly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going now? Have I been so troublesome<lb>
that I must be taken home?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="067">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-072">

<figdesc>Page 067.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to get a third course to follow the berries,<lb>
unless you are afraid to trust yourself to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I'm not; take me where you like, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in her frank tone, her confiding look, seemed<lb>
to please Warwick; he sat a moment looking into the<lb>
brown depths of the water, and let the boat drift, with no<lb>
sound but the musical drip of drops from the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going upon a rock, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did that three months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke as if to himself, his face darkened, and he<lb>
shook the hair off his forehead with an impatient gesture.<lb>
A swift stroke averted the shock, and the boat shot down<lb>
the stream, leaving a track of foam behind it as Warwick<lb>
rowed with the energy of one bent on outstripping some<lb>
importunate remembrance or dogging care. Sylvia marvelled<lb>
greatly at the change which came upon him, but<lb>
held fast with flying hair and lips apart to catch the<lb>
spray, enjoying the breezy flight along a path tessellated<lb>
with broad bars of blue and gold. The race ended as<lb>
abruptly as it began, and Warwick seemed the winner,<lb>
for when they touched the coast of a floating lily-island,<lb>
the cloud was gone. As he shipped his oars he turned,<lb>
saying, with very much the look and manner of a pleasant<lb>
boy &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were asleep when we passed this morning; but I<lb>
know you like lilies, so let us go a fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, capturing a great white<lb>
flower with a clutch that nearly took her overboard. Warwick<lb>
drew her back and did the gathering himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, sir, quite enough. Here are plenty to trim<lb>
our table and ourselves with; leave the rest for other voyagers<lb>
who may come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="068">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-073">

<figdesc>Page 068.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>As Warwick offered her the dripping nosegay he looked<lb>
at the white hand scored with scarlet lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor hand! let the lilies comfort it. You are a true<lb>
woman, Miss Sylvia, for though your palm is purple there 's<lb>
not a stain upon your lips, and you have neither worked<lb>
nor suffered for yourself it seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't deserve that compliment, because I was only<lb>
intent on outdoing you if possible; so you are mistaken<lb>
again you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely, I think. Some faces are so true an index<lb>
of character that one cannot be mistaken. If you doubt<lb>
this look down into the river, and such an one will inevitably<lb>
smile back at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleased, yet somewhat abashed, Sylvia busied herself in<lb>
knotting up the long brown stems and tinging her nose<lb>
with yellow pollen as she inhaled the bitter-sweet breath of<lb>
the lilies. But when Warwick turned to resume the oars,<lb>
she said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us float out as we floated in. It is so still and<lb>
lovely here I like to stay and enjoy it, for we may never<lb>
see just such a scene again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed, and both sat silent, watching the meadows<lb>
that lay green and low along the shore, feeding their eyes<lb>
with the beauty of the landscape, till its peaceful spirit<lb>
seemed to pass into their own, and lend a subtle charm to<lb>
that hour, which henceforth was to stand apart, serene and<lb>
happy, in their memories forever. A still August day, with<lb>
a shimmer in the air that veiled the distant hills with the<lb>
mellow haze, no artist ever truly caught. Midsummer<lb>
warmth and ripeness brooded in the verdure of field and<lb>
forest. Wafts of fragrance went wandering by from newmown<lb>
meadows and gardens full of bloom. All the sky<lb>
<pb n="069">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-074">

<figdesc>Page 069.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
wore its serenest blue, and up the river came frolic winds,<lb>
ruffling the lily leaves until they showed their purple linings,<lb>
sweeping shadowy ripples through the long grass, and<lb>
lifting the locks from Sylvia's forehead with a grateful<lb>
touch, as she sat softly swaying with the swaying of the<lb>
boat. Slowly they drifted out into the current, slowly<lb>
Warwick cleft the water with reluctant stroke, and slowly<lb>
Sylvia's mind woke from its trance of dreamy delight, as<lb>
with a gesture of assent she said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am ready now. That was a happy little moment,<lb>
and I am glad to have lived it, for such times return<lb>
to refresh me when many a more stirring one is quite forgotten.&rdquo;<lb>
A moment after she added, eagerly, as a new<lb>
object of interest appeared: &ldquo;Mr. Warwick, I see smoke.<lb>
I know there is a wood on fire; I want to see it; please<lb>
land again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced over his shoulder at the black cloud trailing<lb>
away before the wind, saw Sylvia's desire in her face, and<lb>
silently complied; for being a keen student of character,<lb>
he was willing to prolong an interview that gave him<lb>
glimpses of a nature in which the woman and the child<lb>
were curiously blended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love fire, and that must be a grand one, if we could<lb>
only see it well. This bank is not high enough; let us go<lb>
nearer and enjoy it,&rdquo; said Sylvia, finding that an orchard<lb>
and a knoll or two intercepted the view of the burning<lb>
wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I am no helpless, fine lady. I can walk,<lb>
run, and climb like any boy; so you need have no fears for<lb>
me. I may never see such a sight again, and you know<lb>
you 'd go if you were alone. Please come, Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="070">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-075">

<figdesc>Page 070.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised Mark to take care of you, and for the very<lb>
reason that you love fire, I'd rather not take you into that<lb>
furnace, lest you never come out again. Let us go back<lb>
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision of his tone ruffled Sylvia, and she turned<lb>
wilful at once, saying in a tone as decided as his own &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I wish to see it. I am always allowed to do what<lb>
I wish, so I shall go;&rdquo; with which mutinous remark she<lb>
walked straight away towards the burning wood.</p>
<p>Warwick looked after her, indulging a momentary desire<lb>
to carry her back to the boat, like a naughty child. But<lb>
the resolute aspect of the figure going on before him, convinced<lb>
him that the attempt would be a failure, and with<lb>
an amused expression he leisurely followed her.</p>
<p>Sylvia had not walked five minutes before she was satisfied<lb>
that it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> too far: but having rebelled, she would<lb>
not own herself in the wrong, and being perverse, insisted<lb>
upon carrying her point, though she walked all night. On<lb>
she went over walls, under rails, across brooks, along the<lb>
furrows of more than one ploughed field, and in among the<lb>
rustling corn, that turned its broad leaves to the sun,<lb>
always in advance of her companion, who followed with<lb>
exemplary submission, but also with a satirical smile, that<lb>
spurred her on as no other demonstration could have done.<lb>
Six o'clock sounded from the church behind the hill; still<lb>
the wood seemed to recede as she pursued, still close behind<lb>
her came the steady footfalls, with no sound of weariness<lb>
in them, and still Sylvia kept on, till, breathless, but successful,<lb>
she reached the object of her search.</p>
<p>Keeping to the windward of the smoke, she gained a<lb>
rocky spot still warm and blackened by the late passage of<lb>
the flames, and pausing there, forgot her own pranks in<lb>
<pb n="071">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-076">

<figdesc>Page 071.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
watching those which the fire played before her eyes.<lb>
Many acres were burning, the air was full of the rush and<lb>
roar of the victorious element, the crash of trees that fell<lb>
before it, and the shouts of men who fought it unavailingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is grand! I wish Mark and Mr. Moor were<lb>
here. Are n't you glad you came, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia glanced up at her companion, as he stood regarding<lb>
the scene with the intent, alert expression one often<lb>
sees in a fine hound when he scents danger in the air. But<lb>
Warwick did not answer, for as she spoke a long, sharp cry<lb>
of human suffering rose above the tumult, terribly distinct<lb>
and full of ominous suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one was killed when that tree fell! Stay here<lb>
till I come back;&rdquo; and Adam strode away into the wood<lb>
as if his place were where the peril lay.</p>
<p>For ten minutes Sylvia waited, pale and anxious; then<lb>
her patience gave out, and saying to herself, &ldquo;I can go<lb>
where he does, and women are always more helpful than<lb>
men at such times,&rdquo; she followed in the direction whence<lb>
came the fitful sound of voices. The ground was hot underneath<lb>
her feet, red eyes winked at her from the blackened<lb>
sod, and fiery tongues darted up here and there, as if<lb>
the flames were lurking still, ready for another outbreak.<lb>
Intent upon her charitable errand, and excited by the novel<lb>
scene, she pushed recklessly on, leaping charred logs, skirting<lb>
still burning stumps, and peering eagerly into the dunveil<lb>
that wavered to and fro. The appearance of an impassable<lb>
ditch obliged her to halt, and pausing to take<lb>
breath, she became aware that she had lost her way. The<lb>
echo of voices had ceased, a red glare was deepening in<lb>
front, and clouds of smoke enveloped her in a stifling atmosphere.<lb>
A sense of bewilderment crept over her; she<lb>
<pb n="072">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-077">

<figdesc>Page 072.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
knew not where she was; and after a rapid flight in what<lb>
she believed a safe direction had been cut short by the fall<lb>
of a blazing tree before her, she stood still, taking counsel<lb>
with herself. Darkness and danger seemed to encompass<lb>
her, fire flickered on every side, and suffocating vapors<lb>
shrouded earth and sky. A bare rock suggested one hope<lb>
of safety, and muffling her head in her skirt, she lay down<lb>
faint and blind, with a dull pain in her temples, and a fear<lb>
at her heart fast deepening into terror, as her breath grew<lb>
painful and her head began to swim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the last of the pleasant voyage! Oh, why does<lb>
no one think of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the regret rose, a cry of suffering and entreaty broke<lb>
from her. She had not called for help till now, thinking<lb>
herself too remote, her voice too feeble to overpower the<lb>
din about her. But some one had thought of her, for as<lb>
the cry left her lips steps came crashing through the wood,<lb>
a pair of strong arms caught her up, and before she could<lb>
collect her scattered senses she was set down beyond all<lb>
danger on the green bank of a little pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, salamander, have you had fire enough?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Warwick, as he dashed a handful of water in her face with<lb>
such energetic goodwill that it took her breath away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh yes, &mdash; and of water, too! Please stop, and let<lb>
me get my breath!&rdquo; gasped Sylvia, warding off a second<lb>
baptism and staring dizzily about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you quit the place where I left you?&rdquo; was<lb>
the next question, somewhat sternly put.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to know what had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you walked into a bonfire to satisfy your curiosity,<lb>
though you had been told to keep out of it? You 'd never<lb>
make a Casabianea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, for of all silly children, that boy was the<lb>
silliest, and he deserved to be blown up for his want of<lb>
common sense,&rdquo; cried the girl, petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obedience is an old-fashioned virtue, which you would<lb>
do well to cultivate along with your common sense, young<lb>
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia changed the subject, for Warwick stood regarding<lb>
her with an irate expression that was somewhat alarming.<lb>
Fanning herself with the wet hat, she asked abruptly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the man hurt, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I not do something for him? He is very far from<lb>
any house, and I have some experience in wounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is past all help, above all want now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia sat down as suddenly as she had risen, and covered<lb>
her face with a shiver, remembering that her own wilfulness<lb>
had tempted a like fate, and she too, might now<lb>
have been `past help, above all want.' Warwick went<lb>
down to the pool to bathe his hot face and blackened hands;<lb>
as he returned Sylvia met him with a submissive &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go back now if you are ready, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the way had seemed long in coming it was doubly so<lb>
in returning, for neither pride nor perversity sustained her<lb>
now, and every step cost an effort. &ldquo;I can rest in the boat,&rdquo;<lb>
was her sustaining thought; great therefore was her dismay<lb>
when on reaching the river no boat was to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Warwick, where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long way down the river by this time, probably.<lb>
<pb n="074">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-079">

</eaffig>
Believing that we landed only for a moment, I did not fasten<lb>
it, and the tide has carried it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of two things, &mdash; spend the night here, or go round<lb>
by the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some three or four miles, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no shorter way? no boat or carriage to be<lb>
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you care to wait, I can look for our runaway, or get<lb>
a wagon from the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is growing late and you would be gone a long time, I<lb>
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which had we better do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not venture to advise. Suit yourself, I will<lb>
obey orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were alone what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked disturbed, Warwick impenetrable, the river<lb>
wide, the road long, and the cliffs the most inaccessible<lb>
of places. An impressive pause ensued, then she said<lb>
frankly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my own fault and I'll take the consequences. I<lb>
choose the bridge and leave you the river. If I don't appear<lb>
till dawn, tell Mark I sent him a good night,&rdquo; and<lb>
girding up her energies she walked bravely off with much<lb>
external composure and internal chagrin.</p>
<p>As before, Warwick followed in silence. For a time<lb>
she kept in advance, then allowed him to gain upon her,<lb>
and presently fell behind, plodding doggedly on through<lb>
thick and thin, vainly trying to conceal the hunger and<lb>
<pb n="075">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-080">

<figdesc>Page 075.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fatigue that were fast robbing her of both strength and<lb>
spirits. Adam watched her with a masculine sense of the<lb>
justice of the retribution which his wilful comrade had<lb>
brought upon herself. But as he saw the elasticity leave<lb>
her steps, the color fade from her cheeks, the resolute<lb>
mouth relax, and the wistful eyes dim once or twice with<lb>
tears of weariness and vexation, pity got the better of pique,<lb>
and he relented. His steady tramp came to a halt, and<lb>
stopping by a wayside spring, he pointed to a mossy stone,<lb>
saying with no hint of superior powers &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are tired, let us rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia dropped down at once, and for a few minutes<lb>
neither spoke, for the air was full of sounds more pertinent<lb>
to the summer night than human voices. From the copse<lb>
behind them, came the coo of wood-pigeons, from the grass<lb>
at their feet the plaintive chirp of crickets; a busy breeze<lb>
whispered through the willow, the little spring dripped<lb>
musically from the rock, and across the meadows came the<lb>
sweet chime of a bell. Twillight was creeping over forest,<lb>
hill, and stream, and seemed to drop refreshment and repose<lb>
upon all weariness of soul and body, more grateful to<lb>
Sylvia, than the welcome seat and leafy cup of water Warwick<lb>
brought her from the spring.</p>
<p>The appearance of a thirsty sparrow gave her thoughts a<lb>
pleasant turn, for, sitting motionless, she watched the little<lb>
creature trip down to the pool, drink and bathe, then flying<lb>
to a willow spray, dress its feathers, dry its wings, and sit<lb>
chirping softly as if it sang its evening hymn. Warwick<lb>
saw her interest, and searching in his pocket, found the<lb>
relics of a biscuit, strewed a few bits upon the ground before<lb>
him, and began a low, sweet whistle, which rose gradually<lb>
to a varied strain, alluring, spirited, and clear as any<lb>
<pb n="076">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-081">

<figdesc>Page 076.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
bird voice of the wood. Little sparrow ceased his twitter,<lb>
listened with outstretched neck and eager eye, hopping<lb>
restlessly from twig to twig, until he hung just over the<lb>
musician's head, agitated with a small flutter of surprise,<lb>
delight, and doubt. Gathering a crumb or two into his<lb>
hand, Warwick held it toward the bird, while softer, sweeter,<lb>
and more urgent rose the invitation, and nearer and<lb>
nearer drew the winged guest, fascinated by the spell.</p>
<p>Suddenly a belated blackbird lit upon the wall, surveyed<lb>
the group and burst into a jubilant song, that for a<lb>
moment drowned his rival's notes. Then, as if claiming<lb>
the reward, he fluttered to the grass, ate his fill, took a sip<lb>
from the mossy basin by the way, and flew singing over the<lb>
river, leaving a trail of music behind him. There was a<lb>
dash and daring about this which fired little sparrow with<lb>
emulation. His last fear seemed conquered, and he flew<lb>
confidingly to Warwick's palm, pecking the crumbs with<lb>
grateful chirps and friendly glances from its quick, bright<lb>
eye. It was a pretty picture for the girl to see; the man,<lb>
an image of power, in his hand the feathered atom, that,<lb>
with unerring instinct, divined and trusted the superior<lb>
nature which had not yet lost its passport to the world of<lb>
innocent delights that Nature gives to those who love her<lb>
best. Involuntarily Sylvia clapped her hands, and, startled<lb>
by the sudden sound, little sparrow skimmed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the pleasantest sight I've seen for many<lb>
a day. How did you learn this gentle art, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a solitary boy, and found my only playmates in<lb>
the woods and fields. I learned their worth, they saw my<lb>
need, and when I asked their friendship, gave it freely.<lb>
Now we should go; you are very tired, let me help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held his hand to her, and she put her own into it with<lb>
<pb n="077">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-082">

<figdesc>Page 077.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="7 *">
a confidence as instinctive as the bird's. Then, hand in<lb>
hand they crossed the bridge and struck into the wilderness<lb>
again; climbing slopes still warm and odorous, passing<lb>
through dells full of chilly damps, along meadows spangled<lb>
with fire-flies, and haunted by sonorous frogs; over rocks<lb>
crisp with pale mosses, and between dark firs, where shadows<lb>
brooded, and melancholy breezes rocked themselves to sleep.<lb>
Speaking seldom, yet feeling no consciousness of silence, no<lb>
sense of restraint, for they no longer seemed like strangers<lb>
to one another, and this spontaneous friendliness lent an<lb>
indefinable charm to the dusky walk. Warwick found satisfaction<lb>
in the knowledge of her innocent faith in him, the<lb>
touch of the little hand he held, the sight of the quiet figure<lb>
at his side. Sylvia felt that it was pleasant to be the<lb>
object of his care, fancied that they would learn to know<lb>
each other better in three days of this free life than in as<lb>
many months at home, and rejoiced over the discovery of<lb>
unsuspected traits in him, like the soft lining of the chestnut<lb>
burr, to which she had compared him more than once<lb>
that afternoon. So, mutually and unconsciously yielding<lb>
to the influence of the hour and the mood it brought<lb>
them, they walked through the twilight in that eloquent<lb>
silence which often proves more persuasive than the most<lb>
fluent speech.</p>
<p>The welcome blaze of their own fire gladdened them at<lb>
length, and when the last step was taken, Sylvia sat down<lb>
with an inward conviction she never could get up again.<lb>
Warwick told their mishap in the fewest possible words,<lb>
while Mark, in a spasm of brotherly solicitude, goaded the<lb>
fire to a roar that his sister's feet might be dried, administered<lb>
a cordial as a preventive against cold, and prescribed<lb>
her hammock the instant supper was done. She went<lb>
<pb n="078">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-083">

<figdesc>Page 078.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
away with him, but a moment after she came to Warwick<lb>
with a box of Prue's ointment and a soft handkerchief stripped<lb>
into bandages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to dress your burns, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will do well enough with a little water; go you<lb>
and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Warwick, you know you ate your supper with<lb>
your left hand, and put both behind you when you saw me<lb>
looking at them. Please let me make them easier; they<lb>
were burnt for me, and I shall get no sleep till I have had<lb>
my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a curious mixture of command and entreaty<lb>
in her manner, and before their owner had time to refuse or<lb>
comply, the scorched hands were taken possession of, the<lb>
red blisters covered with a cool bandage, and the frown of<lb>
pain smoothed out of Warwick's forehead by the prospect<lb>
of relief. As she tied the last knot, Sylvia glanced up<lb>
with a look that mutely asked pardon for past waywardness,<lb>
and expressed gratitude for past help; then, as if her<lb>
heart were set at rest, she was gone before her patient could<lb>
return his thanks.</p>
<p>She did not reappear, Mark went to send a lad after the<lb>
lost boat, and the two friends were left alone; Warwick<lb>
watching the blaze, Moor watching him, till, with a nod<lb>
toward a pair of diminutive boots that stood turning out<lb>
their toes before the fire, Adam said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wearer of those defiant-looking articles is the most<lb>
capricious piece of humanity it was ever my fortune to see.<lb>
You have no idea of the life she has led me since you left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is as freakish, and wears as many shapes as Puck;<lb>
<pb n="079">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-084">

<figdesc>Page 079.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
a gnat, a will-o'-the-wisp, a Sister of Charity, a meek-faced<lb>
child; and one does not know in which guise she pleases<lb>
most. Hard the task of him who has and tries to hold<lb>
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard yet happy; for a word will tame the high spirit,<lb>
a look touch the warm heart, a kind act be repaid with one<lb>
still kinder. She is a woman to be studied well, taught<lb>
tenderly, and, being won, cherished with an affection that<lb>
knows no shadow of a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moor spoke low, and on his face the fire-light seemed to<lb>
shed a ruddier glow than it had done before. Warwick<lb>
eyed him keenly for a moment, then said, with his usual<lb>
abruptness &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geoffrey, you should marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set me the example by mortgaging your own heart,<lb>
Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so. Tell me the romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the old story &mdash; a handsome woman, a foolish man;<lb>
a few weeks of doubt, a few of happiness; then the two<lb>
stand apart to view the leap before they take it; after that,<lb>
peace or purgatory, as they choose well or ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is the probation over, Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In June, God willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hope of deliverance gave to Warwick's tone the<lb>
fervor of desire, and led his friend to believe in the existence<lb>
of a passion deep and strong as the heart he knew so<lb>
well. No further confessions disturbed his satisfaction, for<lb>
Warwick scorned complaint; pity he would not receive,<lb>
sympathy was powerless to undo the past, time alone would<lb>
mend it, and to time he looked for help. He rose presently<lb>
as if bedward bound, but paused behind Moor, turned his<lb>

</eaffig>
face upward, and said, bending on it a look given to this<lb>
friend alone &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my confidence were a good gift, you should have it.<lb>
But my experience must not mar your faith in womankind.<lb>
Keep it as chivalrous as ever, and may God send you the<lb>
mate whom you deserve. Geoffrey, good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a hand-shake more expressive of affection than<lb>
many a tenderer demonstration, they parted &mdash; Warwick to<lb>
watch the stars for hours, and Moor to muse beside the fire<lb>
till the little boots were dry.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hitherto</hi> they had been a most decorous crew, but the<lb>
next morning something in the air seemed to cause a general<lb>
overflow of spirits, and they went up the river like a party<lb>
of children on a merry-making. Sylvia decorated herself<lb>
with garlands till she looked like a mermaid; Mark, as<lb>
skipper, issued his orders with the true Marblehead twang;<lb>
Moor kept up a fire of pun-provoking raillery; Warwick<lb>
sung like a jovial giant; while the Kelpie danced over the<lb>
water as if inspired with the universal gayety, and the very<lb>
ripples seemed to laugh as they hurried by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark, there is a boat coming up behind us with three<lb>
gentlemen in it, who evidently intend to pass us with a<lb>
great display of skill. Of course you won't let it,&rdquo; said<lb>
Sylvia, welcoming the prospect of a race.</p>
<p>Her brother looked over his shoulder, took a critical survey,<lb>
and nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are worth a lesson, and shall have it. Easy, now,<lb>
till they pass; then hard all, and give them a specimen of<lb>
high art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden lull ensued on board the Kelpie while the blue<lb>
shirts approached, caught, and passed with a great display<lb>
of science, as Sylvia had prophesied, and as good an imitation<lb>
of the demeanor of experienced watermen as could be<lb>
<pb n="082">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-087">

<figdesc>Page 082.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
assumed by a trio of studious youths not yet out of their<lb>
teens. As the foam of their wake broke against the other<lb>
boat's side, Mark hailed them &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen! We 'll wait for you above<lb>
there, at the bend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All serene,&rdquo; returned the rival helmsman, with a bow<lb>
in honor of Sylvia, while the other two caused a perceptible<lb>
increase in the speed of the &ldquo;Juanita,&rdquo; whose<lb>
sentimental name was not at all in keeping with its rakish<lb>
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short-sighted infants, to waste their wind in that style;<lb>
but they pull well for their years,&rdquo; observed Mark, paternally,<lb>
as he waited till the others had gained sufficient<lb>
advantage to make the race a more equal one. &ldquo;Now,<lb>
then!&rdquo; he whispered a moment after; and, as if suddenly<lb>
endowed with life, the Kelpie shot away with the smooth<lb>
speed given by strength and skill. Sylvia watched both<lb>
boats, yearning to take an oar herself, yet full of admiration<lb>
for the well-trained rowers, whose swift strokes set the<lb>
river in a foam and made the moment one of pleasure and<lb>
excitement. The blue shirts did their best against competitors<lb>
who had rowed in many crafts and many waters.<lb>
They kept the advantage till near the bend, then Mark's<lb>
crew lent their reserved strength to a final effort, and bending<lb>
to their oars with a will, gained steadily, till, with a<lb>
triumphant stroke, they swept far ahead, and with oars at<lb>
rest waited in magnanimous silence till the Juanita came<lb>
up, gracefully confessing her defeat by a good-humored<lb>
cheer from her panting crew.</p>
<p>For a moment the two boats floated side by side, while<lb>
the young men interchanged compliments and jokes, for a<lb>
river is a highway where all travellers may salute each<lb>
<pb n="083">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-088">

<figdesc>Page 083.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
other, and college boys are &ldquo;Hail fellow! well met&rdquo; with<lb>
all the world.</p>
<p>Sylvia sat watching the lads, and one among them struck<lb>
her fancy. The helmsman who had bowed to her was slight<lb>
and swarthy, with Southern eyes, vivacious manners, and a<lb>
singularly melodious voice. A Spaniard, she thought, and<lb>
pleased herself with this picturesque figure till a traitorous<lb>
smile about the young man's mouth betrayed that he was<lb>
not unconscious of her regard. She colored as she met the<lb>
glance of mingled mirth and admiration that he gave her,<lb>
and hastily began to pull off the weedy decorations which<lb>
she had forgotten. But she paused presently, for she heard<lb>
a surprised voice exclaim &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Warwick! is that you or your ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking up Sylvia saw Adam lift the hat he had pulled<lb>
over his brows, and take a slender brown hand extended over<lb>
the boat-side with something like reluctance, as he answered<lb>
the question in Spanish. A short conversation ensued, in<lb>
which the dark stranger seemed to ask innumerable questions,<lb>
Warwick to give curt replies, and the names Gabriel<lb>
and Ottila to occur with familiar frequency. Sylvia knew<lb>
nothing of the language, but received an impression that<lb>
Warwick was not overjoyed at the meeting; that the youth<lb>
was both pleased and perplexed by finding him there; and<lb>
that neither parted with much regret as the distance slowly<lb>
widened between the boats, and with a farewell salute parted<lb>
company, each taking a different branch of the river, which<lb>
divided just there.</p>
<p>For the first time Warwick allowed Mark to take his<lb>
place at the oar, and sat looking into the clear depths below<lb>
as if some scene lay there which other eyes could not discover.<lb>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the olive-colored party with the fine eyes and<lb>
foreign accent?&rdquo; asked Mark, lazily rowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel Andr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he an Italian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; a Cuban.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot you had tried that mixture of Spain and Alabama.<lb>
How was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As such climates always are to me, &mdash; intoxicating to-day,<lb>
enervating to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel tropically inclined, so tell us about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll prove that by a catechism. Where did you stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Havana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but with whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel Andr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The father of the saffron youth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of whom did the family consist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark, leave Mr. Warwick alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as he answers I shall question. Name the<lb>
four persons, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel, sen., Dolores his wife, Gabriel, jun., Catalina,<lb>
his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! now we progress. Was se&ntilde;orita Catalina as<lb>
comely as her brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You adored her, of course?&rdquo;</p>

it, I know by the satirical glimmer in his eye; therefore I<lb>
continue. She adored you, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will return and marry her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your depravity appals me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I volunteer its discovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I demand it now. You left this girl believing that you<lb>
adored her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew I was fond of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parting was tender?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On her part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iceberg! she wept in your arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gave me an orange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cherished it, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ate it immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What want of sentiment! You promised to return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will never keep the promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never break one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet will not marry her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask how old the lady was, Mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Age, Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark caught a crab of the largest size at this reply, and<lb>
remained where he fell, among the ruins of the castle in<lb>
Spain, which he had erected with the scanty materials<lb>
vouchsafed to him, while Warwick went back to his meditations.<lb>
</p>
<p>A drop of rain roused Sylvia from the contemplation of<lb>
an imaginary portrait of the little Cuban girl, and looking<lb>

skyward she saw that the frolicsome wind had prepared a<lb>
practical joke for them in the shape of a thunder-shower.<lb>
A consultation was held, and it was decided to row on till a<lb>
house appeared, in which they would take refuge till the<lb>
storm was over. On they went, but the rain was in greater<lb>
haste than they, and a summary drenching was effected<lb>
before the toot of a dinner-horn guided them to shelter.<lb>
Landing they marched over the fields, a moist and mirthful<lb>
company, toward a red farm-house standing under venerable<lb>
elms, with a patriarchal air which promised hospitable<lb>
treatment and good cheer. A promise speedily fulfilled by<lb>
the lively old woman, who appeared with an energetic<lb>
&ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo; for the speckled hens congregated in the porch,<lb>
and a hearty welcome for the weather-beaten strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;you be in a mess, aint<lb>
you? Come right in and make yourselves to home. Abel,<lb>
take the men folks up chamber, and fit 'em out with anything<lb>
dry you kin lay hands on. Phebe, see to this poor<lb>
little creeter, and bring her down lookin' less like a drownded<lb>
kitten. Nat, clear up your wittlin's, so 's't they kin toast<lb>
their feet when they come down; and, Cinthy, don't dish<lb>
up dinner jest yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These directions were given with such vigorous illustration,<lb>
and the old face shone with such friendly zeal, that<lb>
the four submitted at once, sure that the kind soul was<lb>
pleasing herself in serving them, and finding something<lb>
very attractive in the place, the people, and their own position.<lb>
Abel, a staid farmer of forty, obeyed his mother's<lb>
order regarding the &ldquo;men folks;&rdquo; and Phebe, a buxom<lb>
girl of sixteen, led Sylvia to her own room, eagerly offering<lb>
her best.</p>
<p>As shed dried and redressed herself, Sylvia made sundry<lb>
<pb n="087">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-092">

<figdesc>Page 087.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
discoveries, which added to the romance and the enjoyment<lb>
of the adventure. A smart gown lay on the bed in the low<lb>
chamber, also various decorations upon chair and table,<lb>
suggesting that some festival was afloat; and a few questions<lb>
elicited the facts. Grandpa had seven sons and three<lb>
daughters, all living, all married, and all blessed with flocks<lb>
of children. Grandpa's birthday was always celebrated by<lb>
a family gathering; but to-day, being the fiftieth anniversary<lb>
of his wedding, the various households had resolved<lb>
to keep it with unusual pomp; and all were coming for a<lb>
supper, a dance, and a &ldquo;sing&rdquo; at the end. Upon receipt<lb>
of which intelligence Sylvia proposed an immediate departure;<lb>
but the grandmother and daughter cried out at this,<lb>
pointed to the still falling rain, the lowering sky, the wet<lb>
hcap on the floor, and insisted on the strangers all remaining<lb>
to enjoy the festival, and give an added interest by their<lb>
presence.</p>
<p>Half promising what she wholly desired, Sylvia put on<lb>
Phebe's second best blue gingham gown for the preservation<lb>
of which she added a white apron, and completing the<lb>
whole with a pair of capacious shoes, went down to find her<lb>
party and reveal the state of affairs. They were bestowed<lb>
in the prim, best parlor, and greeted her with a peal of<lb>
laughter, for all were <hi rend="italics">en costume.</hi> Abel was a stout man,<lb>
and his garments hung upon Moor with a melancholy air;<lb>
Mark had disdained them, and with an eye to effect laid<lb>
hands on an old uniform, in which he looked like a volunteer<lb>
of 1812; while Warwick's superior height placed<lb>
Abel's wardrobe out of the question; and grandpa, taller<lb>
than any of his seven goodly sons, supplied him with a sober<lb>
suit, &mdash; roomy, square-flapped, and venerable, &mdash; which became<lb>
him, and with his beard produced the curious effect<lb>
<pb n="088">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-093">

</eaffig>
of a youthful patriarch. To Sylvia's relief it was unanimously<lb>
decided to remain, trusting to their own penetration<lb>
to discover the most agreeable method of returning the<lb>
favor; and regarding the adventure as a welcome change,<lb>
after two days' solitude, all went out to dinner prepared to<lb>
enact their parts with spirit.</p>
<p>The meal being despatched, Mark and Warwick went to<lb>
help Abel with some out-door arrangements; and begging<lb>
grandma to consider him one of her own boys, Moor tied<lb>
on an apron and fell to work with Sylvia, laying the long<lb>
table which was to receive the coming stores. True breeding<lb>
is often as soon felt by the uncultivated as by the<lb>
cultivated; and the zeal with which the strangers threw<lb>
themselves into the business of the hour won the family,<lb>
and placed them all in friendly relations at once. The old<lb>
lady let them do what they would, admiring everything, and<lb>
declaring over and over again that her new assistants &ldquo;beat<lb>
her boys and girls to nothin' with their tastiness and smartness.&rdquo;<lb>
Sylvia trimmed the table with common flowers till<lb>
it was an inviting sight before a viand appeared upon it,<lb>
and hung green boughs about the room, with candles here<lb>
and there to lend a festal light. Moor trundled a great<lb>
cheese in from the dairy, brought milk-pans without mishap,<lb>
disposed dishes, and caused Nat to cleave to him by<lb>
the administration of surreptitious titbits and jocular suggestions;<lb>
while Phebe tumbled about in every one's way,<lb>
quite wild with excitement; and grandma stood in her<lb>
pantry like a culinary general, swaying a big knife for a<lb>
baton, as she issued orders and marshalled her forces, the<lb>
busiest and merriest of them all.</p>
<p>When the last touch was given, Moor discarded his apron<lb>
and went to join Mark. Sylvia presided over Phebe's<lb>
<pb n="089">

<milestn unit="collation" n="8 *">
toilet, and then sat herself down to support Nat through<lb>
the trying half hour before, as he expressed it, &ldquo;the party<lb>
came in.&rdquo; The twelve years' boy was a cripple, one of<lb>
those household blessings which, in the guise of an affliction,<lb>
keep many hearts tenderly united by a common love<lb>
and pity. A cheerful creature, always chirping like a<lb>
cricket on the hearth as he sat carving or turning bits<lb>
of wood into useful or ornamental shapes for such as cared<lb>
to buy them of him, and hoarding up the proceeds like a<lb>
little miser for one more helpless than himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these, Nat?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, with the interest<lb>
that always won small people, because their quick instincts<lb>
felt that it was sincere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them are spoons &mdash; 'postle spoons, they call 'em. You<lb>
see I 've got a cousin what reads a sight, and one day he<lb>
says to me, `Nat, in a book I see somethin' about a set of<lb>
spoons with a 'postle's head on each of 'em; you make<lb>
some and they 'll sell, I bet.' So I got gramper's Bible,<lb>
found the picters of the 'postles, and worked and worked<lb>
till I got the faces good; and now it 's fun, for they do sell,<lb>
and I 'm savin' up a lot. It ain't for me, you know, but<lb>
mother, 'cause she 's wuss 'n I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she sick, Nat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ain't she! Why she has n't stood up this nine<lb>
year. We was smashed in a wagon that tipped over when<lb>
I was three years old. It done somethin' to my legs, but it<lb>
broke her back, and made her no use, only jest to pet me,<lb>
and keep us all kind of stiddy, you know. Ain't you seen<lb>
her? Don't you want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She admires to see folks, and asked about you at dinner;<lb>
so I guess you 'd better go see her. Look ahere, you<lb>
<pb n="090">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-095">

<figdesc>Page 090.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
like them spoons, and I'm agoin' to give you one; I'd<lb>
give you all on 'em if they wasn't promised. I can make<lb>
one more in time, so you jest take your pick, 'cause I like<lb>
you, and want you not to forgit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia chose Saint John, because it resembled Moor, she<lb>
thought; bespoke and paid for a whole set, and privately<lb>
resolved to send tools and rare woods to the little artist that<lb>
he might serve his mother in his own pretty way. Then<lb>
Nat took up his crutches and hopped nimbly before her to<lb>
the room, where a plain, serene-faced woman lay knitting,<lb>
with her best cap on, her clean handkerchief and large<lb>
green fan laid out upon the coverlet. This was evidently the<lb>
best room of the house; and as Sylvia sat talking to the invalid<lb>
her eye discovered many traces of that refinement<lb>
which comes through the affections. Nothing seemed too<lb>
good for &ldquo;daughter Patience;&rdquo; birds, books, flowers, and<lb>
pictures were plentiful here though visible nowhere else.<lb>
Two easy-chairs beside the bed showed where the old<lb>
folks oftenest sat; Abel's home corner was there by the<lb>
antique desk covered with farmers' literature and samples<lb>
of seeds; Phebe's work-basket stood in the window; Nat's<lb>
lathe in the sunniest corner; and from the speckless carpet<lb>
to the canary's clear water-glass all was exquisitely neat,<lb>
for love and labor were the handmaids who served the helpless<lb>
woman and asked no wages but her comfort.</p>
<p>Sylvia amused her new friends mightily, for finding that<lb>
neither mother nor son had any complaints to make, any<lb>
sympathy to ask, she exerted herself to give them what<lb>
both needed, and kept them laughing by a lively recital of<lb>
her voyage and its mishaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aint she prime, mother?&rdquo; was Nat's candid commentary<lb>
when the story ended, and he emerged red and shiny<lb>
<pb n="091">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-096">

<figdesc>Page 091.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
from the pillows where he had burrowed with boyish explosions<lb>
of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She's very kind, dear, to amuse two stay-at-home folks<lb>
like you and me, who seldom see what's going on outside<lb>
four walls. You have a merry heart, miss, and I hope<lb>
will keep it all your days, for it's a blessed thing to own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you have something better, a contented one,&rdquo;<lb>
said Sylvia, as the woman regarded her with no sign of<lb>
envy or regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have; nine years on a body's back can<lb>
teach a sight of things that are wuth knowin'. I've learnt<lb>
patience pretty well I guess, and contentedness aint fur<lb>
away, for though it sometimes seems ruther long to look<lb>
forward to, perhaps nine more years layin' here, I jest<lb>
remember it might have been wuss, and if I don't do<lb>
much now there's all eternity to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the woman's manner struck Sylvia as she<lb>
watched her softly beating some tune on the sheet with her<lb>
quiet eyes turned toward the light. Many sermons had<lb>
been less eloquent to the girl than the look, the tone, the<lb>
cheerful resignation of that plain face. She stooped and<lb>
kissed it, saying gently &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall remember this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray! there they be; I hear Ben!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away clattered Nat to be immediately absorbed into<lb>
the embraces of a swarm of relatives who now began to<lb>
arrive in a steady stream. Old and young, large and<lb>
small, rich and poor, with overflowing hands or trifles humbly<lb>
given, all were received alike, all hugged by grandpa,<lb>
kissed by grandma, shaken half breathless by Uncle Abel,<lb>
welcomed by Aunt Patience, and danced round by Phebe<lb>
and Nat till the house seemed a great hive of hilarious and<lb>
<pb n="092">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-097">

<figdesc>Page 092.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
affectionate bees. At first the strangers stood apart, but<lb>
Phebe spread their story with such complimentary additions<lb>
of her own that the family circle opened wide and took<lb>
them in at once.</p>
<p>Sylvia was enraptured with the wilderness of babies, and<lb>
leaving the others to their own devices followed the matrons<lb>
to &ldquo;Patience's room,&rdquo; and gave herself up to the pleasant<lb>
tyranny of the small potentates, who swarmed over her as<lb>
she sat on the floor, tugging at her hair, exploring her<lb>
eyes, covering her with moist kisses, and keeping up a<lb>
babble of little voices more delightful to her than the discourse<lb>
of the flattered mammas who benignly surveyed her<lb>
admiration and their offspring's prowess.</p>
<p>The young people went to romp in the barn; the men,<lb>
armed with umbrellas, turned out <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> to inspect the<lb>
farm and stock, and compare notes over pig pens and garden<lb>
gates. But Sylvia lingered where she was, enjoying a<lb>
scene which filled her with a tender pain and pleasure, for<lb>
each baby was laid on grandma's knee, its small virtues,<lb>
vices, ailments, and accomplishments rehearsed, its beauties<lb>
examined, its strength tested, and the verdict of the family<lb>
oracle pronounced upon it as it was cradled, kissed, and<lb>
blessed on the kind old heart which had room for every<lb>
care and joy of those who called her mother. It was a<lb>
sight the girl never forgot, because just then she was ready<lb>
to receive it. Her best lessons did not come from books,<lb>
and she learned one then as she saw the fairest success of<lb>
a woman's life while watching this happy grandmother with<lb>
fresh faces framing her withered one, daughterly voices<lb>
chorusing good wishes, and the harvest of half a century of<lb>
wedded life beautifully garnered in her arms.</p>
<p>The fragrance of coffee and recollections of Cynthia's<lb>
<pb n="093">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-098">

<figdesc>Page 093.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
joyful aberrations at such periods caused a breaking up of<lb>
the maternal conclave. The babies were borne away to<lb>
simmer between blankets until called for. The women<lb>
unpacked baskets, brooded over teapots, and kept up an<lb>
harmonious clack as the table was spread with pyramids of<lb>
cake, regiments of pies, quagmires of jelly, snow-banks of<lb>
bread, and gold mines of butter; every possible article of<lb>
food, from baked beans to wedding cake, finding a place on<lb>
that sacrificial altar.</p>
<p>Fearing to be in the way, Sylvia departed to the barn,<lb>
where she found her party in a chaotic Babel; for the offshoots<lb>
had been as fruitful as the parent tree, and some<lb>
four dozen young immortals were in full riot. The bashful<lb>
roosting with the hens on remote lofts and beams; the bold<lb>
flirting or playing in the full light of day; the boys whooping,<lb>
the girls screaming, all effervescing as if their spirits<lb>
had reached the explosive point and must find vent in noise.<lb>
Mark was in his element, introducing all manner of new<lb>
games, the liveliest of the old and keeping the revel at its<lb>
height; for rosy, bright-eyed girls were plenty, and the<lb>
ancient uniform universally approved. Warwick had a<lb>
flock of lads about him absorbed in the marvels he was<lb>
producing with knife, stick, and string; and Moor a rival<lb>
flock of little lasses breathless with interest in the tales he<lb>
told. One on each knee, two at each side, four in a row<lb>
on the hay at his feet, and the boldest of all with an arm<lb>
about his neck and a curly head upon his shoulder, for<lb>
Uncle Abel's clothes seemed to invest the wearer with a<lb>
passport to their confidence at once. Sylvia joined this<lb>
group and partook of a quiet entertainment with as childlike<lb>
a relish as any of them, while the merry tumult went<lb>
on about her.</p>
<pb n="094">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-099">

<figdesc>Page 094.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The toot of the horn sent the whole barnful streaming<lb>
into the house like a flock of hungry chickens, where, by<lb>
some process known only to the mothers of large families,<lb>
every one was wedged close about the table, and the feast<lb>
began. This was none of your stand-up, wafery, bread and<lb>
butter teas, but a thorough-going, sit-down supper, and<lb>
all settled themselves with a smiling satisfaction, prophetic<lb>
of great powers and an equal willingness to employ them.<lb>
A detachment of half-grown girls was drawn up behind<lb>
grandma, as waiters; Sylvia insisted on being one of them,<lb>
and proved herself a neat-handed Phillis, though for a time<lb>
slightly bewildered by the gastronomic performances she<lb>
beheld. Babies ate pickles, small boys sequestered pie with<lb>
a velocity that made her wink, women swam in the tea, and<lb>
the men, metaphorically speaking, swept over the table like<lb>
a swarm of locusts, while the host and hostess beamed upon<lb>
one another and their robust descendants with an honest<lb>
pride, which was beautiful to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Mr. Wackett ain't eat scursely nothin', he jest<lb>
sets lookin' round kinder 'mazed like. Do go and make<lb>
him fall to on somethin', or I shan't take a mite of comfort<lb>
in my vittles,&rdquo; said grandma, as the girl came with an<lb>
empty cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is enjoying it with all his heart and eyes, ma'am,<lb>
for we don't see such fine spectacles every day. I'll take<lb>
him something that he likes and make him eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive! be you to be Mis' Wackett? I'd no idee<lb>
of it, you look so young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I; we are only friends, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and the monosyllable was immensely expressive,<lb>
as the old lady confided a knowing nod to the teapot, into<lb>
whose depths she was just then peering. Sylvia walked<lb>
<pb n="095">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-100">

<figdesc>Page 095.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
away wondering why persons were always thinking and saying<lb>
such things.</p>
<p>As she paused behind Warwick's chair with a glass of<lb>
cream and a round of brown bread, he looked up at her<lb>
with his blandest expression, though a touch of something<lb>
like regret was in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a sight worth living eighty hard years to see, and<lb>
I envy that old couple as I never envied any one before.<lb>
To rear ten virtuous children, put ten useful men and<lb>
women into the world, and give them health and courage to<lb>
work out their own salvation as these honest souls will do,<lb>
is a better job done for the Lord, than winning a battle, or<lb>
ruling a State. Here is all honor to them. Drink it with<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the glass to her lips, drank what she left, and<lb>
rising, placed her in his seat with the decisive air which<lb>
few resisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take no thought for yourself and are doing too<lb>
much; sit here a little, and let me take a few steps where<lb>
you have taken many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He served her, and standing at her back, bent now and<lb>
then to speak, still with that softened look upon the face<lb>
so seldom stirred by the gentler emotions that lay far<lb>
down in that deep heart of his; for never had he felt so<lb>
solitary.</p>
<p>All things must have an end, even a family feast, and<lb>
by the time the last boys buttons peremptorily announced,<lb>
`Thus far shalt thou go and no farther,' all professed themselves<lb>
satisfied, and a general uprising took place. The<lb>
surplus population were herded in parlor and chambers,<lb>
while a few energetic hands cleared away, and with much<lb>
clattering of dishes and wafting of towels, left grandma's<lb>
<pb n="096">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-101">

<figdesc>Page 096.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
spandy clean premises as immaculate as ever. It was dark<lb>
when all was done, so the kitchen was cleared, the candles<lb>
lighted, Patience's door set open, and little Nat established<lb>
in an impromptu orchestra, composed of a table and a<lb>
chair, whence the first squeak of his fiddle proclaimed that<lb>
the ball had begun.</p>
<p>Everybody danced; the babies stacked on Patience's bed,<lb>
or penned behind chairs, sprawled and pranced in unsteady<lb>
mimicry of their elders. Ungainly farmers, stiff with labor,<lb>
recalled their early days and tramped briskly as they swung<lb>
their wives about with a kindly pressure of the hard hands<lb>
that had worked so long together. Little pairs toddled<lb>
gravely through the figures, or frisked promiscuously in a<lb>
grand conglomeration of arms and legs. Gallant cousins<lb>
kissed pretty cousins at exciting periods, and were not rebuked.<lb>
Mark wrought several of these incipient lovers to a<lb>
pitch of despair, by his devotion to the comeliest damsels,<lb>
and the skill with which he executed unheard-of evolutions<lb>
before their admiring eyes; Moor led out the poorest and<lb>
the plainest with a respect that caused their homely faces<lb>
to shine, and their scant skirts to be forgotten. Warwick<lb>
skimmed his five years partner through the air in a way<lb>
that rendered her speechless with delight; and Sylvia danced<lb>
as she never danced before. With sticky-fingered boys,<lb>
sleepy with repletion, but bound to last it out; with roughfaced<lb>
men who paid her paternal compliments; with smart<lb>
youths who turned sheepish with that white lady's hand in<lb>
their big brown ones, and one ambitious lad who confided<lb>
to her his burning desire to work a sawmill, and marry a<lb>
girl with black eyes and yellow hair. While, perched aloft,<lb>
Nat bowed away till his pale face glowed, till all hearts<lb>
warmed, all feet beat responsive to the good old tunes which<lb>
<pb n="097">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-102">

<figdesc>Page 097.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="9">
have put so much health into human bodies, and so much<lb>
happiness into human souls.</p>
<p>At the stroke of nine the last dance came. All down the<lb>
long kitchen stretched two breathless rows; grandpa and<lb>
grandma at the top, the youngest pair of grandchildren at<lb>
the bottom, and all between fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts,<lb>
and cousins, while such of the babies as were still extant,<lb>
bobbed with unabated vigor, as Nat struck up the Virginia<lb>
Reel, and the sturdy old couple led off as gallantly as the<lb>
young one who came tearing up to meet them. Away they<lb>
went, grandpa's white hair flying in the wind, grandma's<lb>
impressive cap awry with excitement, as they ambled down<lb>
the middle, and finished with a kiss when their tuneful<lb>
journey was done, amid immense applause from those who<lb>
regarded this as the crowning event of the day.</p>
<p>When all had had their turn, and twirled till they were<lb>
dizzy, a short lull took place, with refreshments for such as<lb>
still possessed the power of enjoying them. Then Phebe<lb>
appeared with an armful of books, and all settled themselves<lb>
for the family &ldquo;sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia had heard much fine music, but never any that<lb>
touched her like this, for, though often discordant, it was<lb>
hearty, with that under-current of feeling which adds sweetness<lb>
to the rudest lay, and is often more attractive than the<lb>
most florid ornament or faultless execution. Every one<lb>
sang as every one had danced, with all their might; shrill<lb>
children, soft-voiced girls, lullaby-singing mothers, gruff<lb>
boys, and strong-lunged men; the old pair quavered, and<lb>
still a few indefatigable babies crowed behind their little<lb>
coops. Songs, ballads, comic airs, popular melodies, and<lb>
hymns, came in rapid succession. And when they ended<lb>
with that song which should be classed with sacred music<lb>
<pb n="098">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-103">

<figdesc>Page 098.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
for association's sake, and standing hand in hand about the<lb>
room with the golden bride and bridegroom in their midst,<lb>
sang &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; Sylvia leaned against her brother with dim<lb>
eyes and a heart too full to sing.</p>
<p>Still standing thus when the last note had soared up and<lb>
died, the old man folded his hands and began to pray. It<lb>
was an old-fashioned prayer, such as the girl had never<lb>
heard from the Bishop's lips; ungrammatical, inelegant, and<lb>
long. A quiet talk with God, manly in its straightforward<lb>
confession of short-comings, childlike in its appeal for<lb>
guidance, fervent in its gratitude for all good gifts, and the<lb>
crowning one of loving children. As if close intercourse<lb>
had made the two familiar, this human father turned to the<lb>
Divine, as these sons and daughters turned to him, as free<lb>
to ask, as confident of a reply, as all afflictions, blessings,<lb>
cares, and crosses, were laid down before him, and the work<lb>
of eighty years submitted to his hand. There were no<lb>
sounds in the room but the one voice often tremulous with<lb>
emotion and with age, the coo of some dreaming baby, or the<lb>
low sob of some mother whose arms were empty, as the old<lb>
man stood there, rugged and white atop as the granite hills,<lb>
with the old wife at his side, a circle of sons and daughters<lb>
girdling them round, and in all hearts the thought that as<lb>
the former wedding had been made for time, this golden<lb>
one at eighty must be for eternity.</p>
<p>While Sylvia looked and listened a sense of genuine devotion<lb>
stole over her; the beauty and the worth of prayer<lb>
grew clear to her through the earnest speech of that unlettered<lb>
man, and for the first time she fully felt the nearness<lb>
and the dearness of the Universal Father, whom she had<lb>
been taught to fear, yet longed to love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my children, you must go before the little folks<lb>

are tuckered out,&rdquo; said Grandpa, heartily. &ldquo;Mother and<lb>
me can't say enough toe thank you for the presents you<lb>
have fetched us, the dutiful wishes you have give us, the<lb>
pride and comfort you have allers ben toe us. I aint no<lb>
hand at speeches, so I shan't make none, but jest say ef<lb>
any 'fliction falls on any on you, remember mother's here<lb>
toe help you bear it; ef any worldly loss comes toe you,<lb>
remember father's house is yourn while it stans, and so the<lb>
Lord bless and keep us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for gramper and grammer!&rdquo; roared a<lb>
six-foot scion as a safety valve for sundry unmasculine<lb>
emotions, and three rousing hurras made the rafters ring,<lb>
struck terror to the heart of the oldest inhabitant of the<lb>
rat-haunted garret, and summarily woke all the babies.</p>
<p>Then the good-byes began, the flurry of wrong baskets,<lb>
pails and bundles in wrong places; the sorting out of small<lb>
folk too sleepy to know or care what became of them; the<lb>
maternal cluckings, and paternal shouts for Kitty, Cy,<lb>
Ben, Bill, or Mary Ann; the piling into vehicles with<lb>
much ramping of indignant horses unused to such late<lb>
hours; the last farewells, the roll of wheels, as one by one<lb>
the happy loads departed, and peace fell upon the household<lb>
for another year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare for't, I never had sech an out an out good<lb>
time sense I was born intoe the world. Ab'ram, you are<lb>
fit to drop, and so be I; now let's set and talk it over along<lb>
of Patience fore we go toe bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old couple got into their chairs, and as they sat there<lb>
side by side, remembering that she had given no gift, Sylvia<lb>
crept behind them, and lending the magic of her voice<lb>
to the simple air, sang the fittest song for time and place&mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;John Anderson my Jo.&rdquo; It was too much for grandma,<lb>
<pb n="100">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-105">

<figdesc>Page 100.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the old heart overflowed, and reckless of the cherished cap<lb>
she laid her head on her &ldquo;John's&rdquo; shoulder, exclaiming<lb>
through her tears &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's the cap shcaf of the hull, and I can't bear no<lb>
more to-night. Ab'ram, lend me your hankchif, for I dunno<lb>
where mine is, and my face is all of a drip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the red bandana had gently performed its work<lb>
in grandpa's hand, Sylvia beckoned her party from the<lb>
room, and showing them the clear moonlight night which<lb>
followed the storm, suggested that they should both save<lb>
appearances and enjoy a novel pleasure by floating homeward<lb>
instead of sleeping. The tide against which they had<lb>
pulled in coming up would sweep them rapidly along, and<lb>
make it easy to retrace in a few hours the way they had<lb>
loitered over for three days.</p>
<p>The pleasant excitement of the evening had not yet subsided,<lb>
and all applauded the plan as a fit finale to their<lb>
voyage. The old lady strongly objected, but the young<lb>
people overruled her, and being re-equipped in their damaged<lb>
garments they bade the friendly family a grateful<lb>
adieu, left their more solid thanks under Nat's pillow, and<lb>
re-embarked upon their shining road.</p>
<p>All night Sylvia lay under the canopy of boughs her<lb>
brother made to shield her from the dew, listening to the<lb>
soft sounds about her, the twitter of a restless bird, the<lb>
bleat of some belated lamb, the ripple of a brook babbling<lb>
like a baby in its sleep. All night she watched the changing<lb>
shores, silvery green or dark with slumberous shadow,<lb>
and followed the moon in its tranquil journey through the<lb>
sky. When it set, she drew her cloak about her, and, pillowing<lb>
her head upon her arm, exchanged the waking for a<lb>
sleeping dream.</p>
<pb n="101">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>A thick mist encompassed her when she awoke. Above<lb>
the sun shone dimly, below rose and fell the billows of the<lb>
sea, before her sounded the city's fitful hum, and far behind<lb>
her lay the green wilderness where she had lived and<lb>
learned so much. Slowly the fog lifted, the sun came dazzling<lb>
down upon the sea, and out into the open bay they<lb>
sailed with the pennon streaming in the morning wind.<lb>
But still with backward glance the girl watched the misty<lb>
wall that rose between her and the charmed river, and still<lb>
with yearning heart confessed how sweet that brief experience<lb>
had been, for though she had not yet discovered it,<lb>
like</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">I never</hi> did understand you, Sylvia; and this last<lb>
month you have been a perfect enigma to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With rocking-chair in full action, suspended needle and<lb>
thoughtful expression, Miss Yule had watched her sister<lb>
for ten minutes as she sat with her work at her feet, her<lb>
hands folded on her lap, and her eyes dreamily fixed on<lb>
vacancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always was to myself, Prue, and am more so than<lb>
ever now,&rdquo; answered Sylvia, waking out of her reverie with<lb>
a smile that proved it had been a pleasant one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some reason for this great change in<lb>
you. Come, tell me, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a motherly gesture Miss Yule drew the girl to her<lb>
knee, brushed back the bright hair, and looked into the face<lb>
so freely turned to hers. Through all the years they had<lb>
been together, the elder sister had never seen before the<lb>
expression which the younger's face now wore. A vague<lb>
expectancy sat in her eyes, some nameless content sweetened<lb>
her smile, a beautiful repose replaced the varying, enthusiasm,<lb>
listlessness, and melancholy that used to haunt her<lb>
countenance and make it such a study. Miss Yule could<lb>
not read the secret of the change, yet felt its novel charm;<lb>
Sylvia could not explain it, though penetrated by its power;<lb>
<pb n="103">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-108">

<figdesc>Page 103.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and for a moment the sisters looked into each other's faces,<lb>
wondering why each seemed altered. Then Prue, who never<lb>
wasted much time in speculations of any kind, shook her<lb>
head, and repeated &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't understand it, but it must be right, because<lb>
you are so improved in every way. Ever since that wild<lb>
trip up the river you have been growing quiet, lovable, and<lb>
cheerful, and I really begin to hope that you will become<lb>
like other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know that I am happy, Prue. Why it is so I<lb>
cannot tell; but now I seldom have the old dissatisfied and<lb>
restless feeling. Everything looks pleasant to me, every<lb>
one seems kind, and life begins to be both sweet and earnest.<lb>
It is only one of my moods, I suppose; but I am grateful<lb>
for it, and pray that it may last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So earnestly she spoke, so cheerfully she smiled, that<lb>
Miss Yule blessed the mood and echoed Sylvia's wish,<lb>
exclaiming in the next breath, with a sudden inspiration &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, dear, I've got it! You are growing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am. You tried to make a woman of me at<lb>
sixteen, but it was impossible until the right time came.<lb>
That wild trip up the river, as you call it, did more for me<lb>
than I can ever tell, and when I seemed most like a child<lb>
I was learning to be a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, go on as you've begun, and I shall be<lb>
more than satisfied. What merry-making is on foot to-night?<lb>
Mark and these friends of his keep you in constant<lb>
motion with their riding, rowing, and rambling excursions,<lb>
and if it did not agree with you so excellently, I really<lb>
should like a little quiet after a month of bustle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are only coming up as usual, and that reminds<lb>
me that I must go and dress.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="104">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-109">

<figdesc>Page 104.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another new change, Sylvia. You never used<lb>
to care what you wore or how you looked, no matter how<lb>
much time and trouble I expended on you and your wardrobe.<lb>
Now you do care, and it does my heart good to see<lb>
you always charmingly dressed, and looking your prettiest,&rdquo;<lb>
said Miss Yule, with the satisfaction of a woman who<lb>
heartily believed in costume as well as all the other elegances<lb>
and proprieties of fashionable life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I ever that, Prue?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, pausing on the<lb>
threshold with a shy yet wistful glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever what, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always so to me; and now I think every one finds you<lb>
very attractive because you try to please, and seem to succeed<lb>
delightfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia had never asked that question before, had never<lb>
seemed to know or care, and could not have chosen a more<lb>
auspicious moment for her frank inquiry than the present.<lb>
The answer seemed to satisfy her, and smiling at some<lb>
blithe anticipation of her own, she went away to make a<lb>
lampless toilet in the dusk, which proved how slight a hold<lb>
the feminine passion for making one's self pretty had yet<lb>
taken upon her.</p>
<p>The September moon was up and shining clearly over<lb>
garden, lawn, and sea, when the sound of voices called her<lb>
down. At the stair-foot she paused with a disappointed<lb>
air, for only one hat lay on the hall table, and a glance<lb>
showed her only one guest with Mark and Prue. She<lb>
strolled irresolutely through the breezy hall, looked out at<lb>
either open door, sung a little to herself, but broke off in<lb>
the middle of a line, and as if following a sudden impulse,<lb>
went out into the mellow moonlight, forgetful of uncovered<lb>
<pb n="105">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-110">

<figdesc>Page 105.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
head or dewy damage to the white hem of her gown.<lb>
Half way down the avenue she paused before a shady nook,<lb>
and looked in. The evergreens that enclosed it made the<lb>
seat doubly dark to eyes inured to the outer light, and seeing<lb>
a familiar seeming figure sitting with its head upon its<lb>
hand, Sylvia leaned in, saying, with a daughterly caress &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is my romantie father doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sense of touch was quicker than that of sight, and<lb>
with an exclamation of surprise she had drawn back before<lb>
Warwick replied &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the old man, but the young one, who is romancing<lb>
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon! We have been waiting for you;<lb>
what thought is so charming that you forgot us all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia was a little startled, else she would scarcely have<lb>
asked so plain a question. But Warwick often asked much<lb>
blunter ones, always told the naked truth without prevarication<lb>
or delay, and straightway answered &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thought of the woman whom I hope to make my<lb>
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia stood silent for a moment as if intent on fastening<lb>
in her hair the delicate spray of hop-bells just gathered<lb>
from the vine that formed a leafy frame for the graceful<lb>
picture which she made standing, with uplifted arms, behind<lb>
the arch. When she spoke it was to say, as she<lb>
moved on toward the house &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too beautiful a night to stay in doors, but Prue is<lb>
waiting for me, and Mark wants to plan with you about<lb>
our ride to-morrow. Shall we go together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She beckoned, and he came out of the shadow showing<lb>
her an expression which she had never seen before. His<lb>
face was flushed, his eye unquiet, his manner eager yet<lb>
<pb n="106">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-111">

<figdesc>Page 106.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
restrained. She had seen him intellectually excited many<lb>
times; never emotionally till now. Something wayward,<lb>
yet warm, in this new mood attracted her, because so like<lb>
her own. But with a tact as native as her sympathy she<lb>
showed no sign of this, except in the attentive look she<lb>
fixed upon him as the moonlight bathed him in its splendor.<lb>
He met the glance, seemed to interpret it aright, but<lb>
did not answer its unconscious inquiry; for pausing, he<lb>
asked abruptly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should a rash promise be considered binding when it<lb>
threatens to destroy one's peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia pondered an instant before she answered slowly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the promise was freely given, no sin committed in its<lb>
keeping, and no peace troubled but one's own, I should say<lb>
yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still pausing, he looked down at her with that unquiet<lb>
glance as she looked up with her steady one, and with the<lb>
same anxiety he asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you keep such a promise inviolate, even though<lb>
it might cost you the sacrifice of something dearer to you<lb>
than your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought again, and again looked up, answering with<lb>
the sincerity that he had taught her &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be unwise, but if the sacrifice was not one of<lb>
principle or something that I ought to love more than life,<lb>
I think I should keep the promise as religiously as an<lb>
Indian keeps a vow of vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, some recollection seemed to strike Warwick<lb>
like a sudden stab. The flush died out of his face, the fire<lb>
from his eyes, and an almost grim composure fell upon him<lb>
as he said low to himself, with a forward step as if eager<lb>
to leave some pain behind him &mdash;</p>
<pb n="107">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-112">

<figdesc>Page 107.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better so; for his sake I will leave all to time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia saw his lips move, but caught no sound till he<lb>
said with a gravity that was almost gloom &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would; therefore, beware how you bind<lb>
yourself with such verbal bonds. Let us go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went; Warwick to the drawing-room, but Sylvia<lb>
ran up stairs for the Berlin wools, which in spite of heat<lb>
and the sure staining of fingers were to be wound that<lb>
night according to contract, for she kept a small promise<lb>
as sacredly as she would have done a greater one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing to give yourself such an<lb>
uplifted expression, Sylvia?&rdquo; said Mark, as she came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feasting my eyes on lovely colors. Does not that look<lb>
like a folded rainbow?&rdquo; she answered, laying her brilliant<lb>
burden on the table where Warwick sat examining a broken<lb>
reel, and Prue was absorbed in getting a carriage blanket<lb>
under way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Sylvia, I shall soon be ready for the first shade,&rdquo;<lb>
she said, clashing her formidable needles. &ldquo;Is that past<lb>
mending, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, without better tools than a knife, two pins, and a<lb>
bodkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must put the skeins on a chair, Sylvia. Try<lb>
not to tangle them, and spread your handkerchief in your<lb>
lap, for that maroon color will stain sadly. Now don't<lb>
speak to me, for I must count my stitches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia began to wind the wools with a swift dexterity as<lb>
natural to her hands as certain little graces of gesture<lb>
which made their motions pleasant to watch. Warwick<lb>
never rummaged work-baskets, gossipped, or paid compliments<lb>
for want of something to do. If no little task appeared<lb>
for them, he kept his hands out of mischief, and if<lb>
<pb n="108">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-113">

<figdesc>Page 108.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
nothing occurred to make words agreeable or necessary, he<lb>
proved that he understood the art of silence, and sat with<lb>
those vigilant eyes of his fixed upon whatever object attracted<lb>
them. Just then the object was a bright band slipping<lb>
round the chair-back, with a rapidity that soon produced a<lb>
snarl, but no help till patient fingers had smoothed and<lb>
wound it up. Then, with the look of one who says to himself,<lb>
&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; he turned, planted himself squarely before<lb>
Sylvia, and held out his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a reel that will neither tangle nor break your<lb>
skeins, will you use it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, and in return I'll wind your color first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is my color?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fine scarlet, strong, enduring, and martial, like<lb>
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so; Mr. Moor prefers blue, and I violet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue and red make violet,&rdquo; called Mark from his corner,<lb>
catching the word &ldquo;color,&rdquo; though busy with a sketch for a<lb>
certain fair Jessie Hope.</p>
<p>Moor was with Mr. Yule in his study, Prue mentally<lb>
wrapped in her blanket, and when Sylvia was drawn into<lb>
an artistic controversy with her brother, Warwick fell into<lb>
deep thought.</p>
<p>With the pride of a proud man once deceived, he had<lb>
barred his heart against womankind, resolving that no second<lb>
defeat should oppress him with that distrust of self and<lb>
others, which is harder for a generous nature to bear, than<lb>
the pain of its own wound. He had yet to learn that the<lb>
shadow of love suggests its light, and that they who have<lb>
been cheated of the food, without which none can truly live,<lb>
long for it with redoubled hunger. Of late he had been<lb>
<pb n="109">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-114">

<figdesc>Page 109.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="10">
discovering this, for a craving, stronger than his own strong<lb>
will, possessed him. He tried to disbelieve and silence it;<lb>
attacked it with reason, starved it with neglect, and chilled it<lb>
with contempt. But when he fancied it was dead, the longing<lb>
rose again, and with a clamorous cry, undid his work. For<lb>
the first time, this free spirit felt the master's hand, confessed<lb>
a need its own power could not supply, and saw that<lb>
no man can live alone on even the highest aspirations without<lb>
suffering for the vital warmth of the affections. A<lb>
month ago he would have disdained the hope that now was<lb>
so dear to him. But imperceptibly the influences of domestic<lb>
life had tamed and won him. Solitude looked barren,<lb>
vagrancy had lost its charm; his life seemed cold and bare,<lb>
for, though devoted to noble aims, it was wanting in the<lb>
social sacrifices, cares, and joys, that foster charity, and<lb>
sweeten character. An impetuous desire to enjoy the rich<lb>
experience which did so much for others, came over him to-night<lb>
as it had often done while sharing the delights of this<lb>
home, where he had made so long a pause. But with the<lb>
desire came a memory that restrained him better than his<lb>
promise. He saw what others had not yet discovered, and<lb>
obeying the code of honor which governs a true gentleman,<lb>
loved his friend better than himself and held his<lb>
peace.</p>
<p>The last skein came, and as she wound it, Sylvia's glance<lb>
involuntarily rose from the strong hands to the face above<lb>
them, and lingered there, for the penetrating gaze was averted,<lb>
and an unwonted mildness inspired confidence as its<lb>
usual expression of power commanded respect. His silence<lb>
troubled her, and with curious yet respectful scrutiny, she<lb>
studied his face as she had never done before. She found<lb>
it full of a noble gravity and kindliness; candor and<lb>
<pb n="110">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-115">

<figdesc>Page 110.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
courage spoke in the lines of the mouth, benevolence and intellect<lb>
in the broad arch of the forehead, ardor and energy in<lb>
the fire of the eye, and on every lineament the stamp of that<lb>
genuine manhood, which no art can counterfeit. Intent<lb>
upon discovering the secret of the mastery he exerted over<lb>
all who approached him, Sylvia had quite forgotten herself,<lb>
when suddenly Warwick's eyes were fixed full upon her own.<lb>
What spell lay in them she could not tell, for human eye<lb>
had never shed such sudden summer over her. Admiration<lb>
was not in it, for it did not agltate; nor audacity, for it did<lb>
not abash; but something that thrilled warm through blood<lb>
and nerves, that filled her with a glad submission to some<lb>
power, absolute yet tender, and caused her to turn her innocent<lb>
face freely to his gaze, letting him read therein a<lb>
sentiment for which she had not yet found a name.</p>
<p>It lasted but a moment; yet in that moment, each saw<lb>
the other's heart, and each turned a new page in the romance<lb>
of their lives. Sylvia's eyes fell first, but no blush<lb>
followed, no sign of anger or perplexity, only a thoughtful<lb>
silence, which continued till the last violet thread dropped<lb>
from his hands, and she said almost regretfully &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he echoed the words Warwick rose suddenly and went<lb>
to talk with Mark, whose sketch was done. Sylvia sat a<lb>
moment as if quite forgetful where she was, so absorbing<lb>
was some thought or emotion. Presently she seemed to<lb>
glow and kindle with an inward fire; over face and forehead<lb>
rushed an impetuous color, her eyes shone, and her lips<lb>
trembled with the fluttering of her breath. Then a panic<lb>
appeared to seize her, for, stealing noiselessly away, she<lb>
hurried to her room, and covering up her face as if to hide<lb>
<pb n="111">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-116">

<figdesc>Page 111.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
it even from herself, whispered to that full heart of hers,<lb>
with quick coming tears that belied the words &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know why I am happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long she lay there weeping and smiling in the moonlight<lb>
she never knew. Her sister's call broke in upon the<lb>
first love dream she had ever woven for herself, and she<lb>
went down to bid the friends good night. The hall was<lb>
only lighted by the moon, and in the dimness of the shadow<lb>
where she stood, no one saw traces of that midsummer<lb>
shower on her cheeks, or detected the soft trouble in her<lb>
eye, but for the first time Moor felt her hand tremble in<lb>
his own and welcomed the propitious omen.</p>
<p>Being an old-fashioned gentleman, Mr. Yule preserved in<lb>
his family the pleasant custom of hand-shaking, which<lb>
gives such heartiness to the morning and evening greetings<lb>
of a household. Moor liked and adopted it; Warwick<lb>
had never done so, but that night he gave a hand to Prue<lb>
and Mark with his most cordial expression, and Sylvia felt<lb>
both her own taken in a warm lingering grasp, although he<lb>
only said &ldquo;good by!&rdquo; Then they went; but while the<lb>
three paused at the door held by the beauty of the night,<lb>
back to them on the wings of the wind came Warwick's<lb>
voice singing the song that Sylvia loved. All down the<lb>
avenue, and far along the winding road they traced his progress,<lb>
till the strain died in the distance leaving only the<lb>
echo of the song to link them to the singer.</p>
<p>When evening came again Sylvia waited on the lawn<lb>
to have the meeting over in the dark, for love made her<lb>
very shy. But Moor came alone, and his first words were,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfort me, Sylvia, Adam is gone. He went as unexpectedly<lb>
as he came, and when I woke this morning a<lb>
note lay at my door, but my friend was not there.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="112">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-117">

<figdesc>Page 112.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>She murmured some stereotyped regret, but there was a<lb>
sharp pain at her heart till there came to her the remembrance<lb>
of Warwick's question, uttered on the spot where she<lb>
was standing. Some solace she must have, and clinging to<lb>
this one thought hopefully within herself &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has made some promise, has gone to get released<lb>
from it, and will come back to say what he looked last<lb>
night. He is so true I will believe in him and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did wait, but week after week went by and Warwick<lb>
did not come.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whoever</hi> cares only for incident and action in a book<lb>
had better skip this chapter and read on; but those who<lb>
take an interest in the delineation of character will find the<lb>
key to Sylvia's here.</p>
<p>John Yule might have been a poet, painter, or philanthropist,<lb>
for Heaven had endowed him with fine gifts; he was a<lb>
prosperous merchant with no ambition but to leave a fortune<lb>
to his children and live down the memory of a bitter past.<lb>
On the threshold of his life he stumbled and fell; for as<lb>
he paused there, waiting for the first step to appear, Providence<lb>
tested and found him wanting. On one side, Poverty<lb>
offered the aspiring youth her meagre hand; but he was not<lb>
wise enough to see the virtues hidden under her hard<lb>
aspect, nor brave enough to learn the stern yet salutary<lb>
lessons which labor, necessity, and patience teach, giving to<lb>
those who serve and suffer the true success. On the other<lb>
hand Opulence allured him with her many baits, and, silencing<lb>
the voice of conscience, he yielded to temptation and<lb>
wrecked his nobler self.</p>
<p>A loveless marriage was the price he paid for his ambition;<lb>
not a costly one, he thought, till time taught him that<lb>
whosoever mars the integrity of his own soul by transgressing<lb>
the great laws of life, even by so much as a hair's<lb>
<pb n="114">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-119">

<figdesc>Page 114.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
breadth, entails upon himself and heirs the inevitable<lb>
retribution which proves their worth and keeps them sacred.<lb>
The tie that bound and burdened the unhappy twain, worn<lb>
thin by constant friction, snapped at last, and in the solemn<lb>
pause death made in his busy life, there rose before him<lb>
those two ghosts who sooner or later haunt us all, saying<lb>
with reproachful voices, &mdash; &ldquo;This I might have been,&rdquo; and<lb>
&ldquo;This I am.&rdquo; Then he saw the failure of his life. At<lb>
fifty he found himself poorer than when he made his momentous<lb>
choice; for the years that had given him wealth,<lb>
position, children, had also taken from him youth, self-respect,<lb>
and many a gift whose worth was magnified by loss.<lb>
He endeavored to repair the fault so tardily acknowledged,<lb>
but found it impossible to cancel it when remorse, embittered<lb>
effort, and age left him powerless to redeem the rich inheritance<lb>
squandered in his prime.</p>
<p>If ever man received punishment for a self-inflicted<lb>
wrong it was John Yule. A punishment as subtle as the<lb>
sin; for in the children growing up about him every relinquished<lb>
hope, neglected gift, lost aspiration, seemed to live<lb>
again; yet on each and all was set the direful stamp of<lb>
imperfection, which made them visible illustrations of the<lb>
great law broken in his youth.</p>
<p>In Prudence, as she grew to womanhood, he saw his own<lb>
practical tact and talent, nothing more. She seemed the<lb>
living representative of the years spent in strife for profit,<lb>
power, and place; the petty cares that fret the soul, the<lb>
mercenary schemes that waste a life, the worldly formalities,<lb>
frivolities, and fears, that so belittle character. All these<lb>
he saw in this daughter's shape; and with pathetic patience<lb>
bore the daily trial of an over active, over anxious, affectionate<lb>
but most prosaic child.</p>

</p>
<p>In Mark he saw his ardor for the beautiful, his love of<lb>
the poetic, his reverence for genius, virtue, heroism. But<lb>
here too the subtle blight had fallen. This son, though<lb>
strong in purpose was feeble in performance; for some<lb>
hidden spring of power was wanting, and the shadow of<lb>
that earlier defeat chilled in his nature the energy which is<lb>
the first attribute of all success. Mark loved poetry, and<lb>
&ldquo;wrote in numbers for the numbers came;&rdquo; but, whether<lb>
tragic, tender, or devout, in each attempt there was enough<lb>
of the divine fire to warm them into life, yet not enough to<lb>
gift them with the fervor that can make a line immortal,<lb>
and every song was a sweet lament for the loftier lays that<lb>
might have been. He loved art and gave himself to it;<lb>
but though studying all forms of beauty he never reached<lb>
its soul, and every effort tantalized him with fresh glimpses<lb>
of the fair ideal which he could not reach. He loved the<lb>
true, but high thoughts seldom blossomed into noble deeds;<lb>
for when the hour came the man was never ready, and disappointment<lb>
was his daily portion. A sad fate for the son,<lb>
a far sadder one for the father who had bequeathed it to<lb>
him from the irrecoverable past.</p>
<p>In Sylvia he saw, mysteriously blended, the two natures<lb>
that had given her life, although she was born when the<lb>
gulf between regretful husband and sad wife was widest.<lb>
As if indignant Nature rebelled against the outrage done<lb>
her holiest ties, adverse temperaments gifted the child with<lb>
the good and ill of each. From her father she received<lb>
pride, intellect, and will; from her mother passion, imagination,<lb>
and the fateful melancholy of a woman defrauded<lb>
of her dearest hope. These conflicting temperaments, with<lb>
all their aspirations, attributes, and inconsistencies, were<lb>
woven into a nature fair and faulty; ambitious, yet not<lb>
<pb n="116">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-121">

<figdesc>Page 116.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
self-reliant; sensitive, yet not keen-sighted. These two<lb>
masters ruled soul and body, warring against each other,<lb>
making Sylvia an enigma to herself and her life a train of<lb>
moods.</p>
<p>A wise and tender mother would have divined her nameless<lb>
needs, answered her vague desires, and through the<lb>
medium of the most omnipotent affection given to humanity,<lb>
have made her what she might have been. But Sylvia had<lb>
never known mother-love, for her life came through death;<lb>
and the only legacy bequeathed her was a slight hold upon<lb>
existence, a ceaseless craving for affection, and the shadow<lb>
of a tragedy that wrung from the pale lips, that grew cold<lb>
against her baby cheek, the cry, &ldquo;Free at last, thank God for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prudence could not fill the empty place, though the<lb>
good-hearted housewife did her best. Neither sister understood<lb>
the other, and each tormented the other through her<lb>
very love. Prue unconsciously exasperated Sylvia, Sylvia<lb>
unconsciously shocked Prue, and they hitched along together<lb>
each trying to do well and each taking diametrically opposite<lb>
measures to effect her purpose. Mark briefly but<lb>
truly described them when he said, &ldquo;Sylvia trims the<lb>
house with flowers, but Prudence dogs her with a dustpan.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>Mr. Yule was now a studious, melancholy man, who,<lb>
having said one fatal &ldquo;No&rdquo; to himself, made it the satisfaction<lb>
of his life to say a never varying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to his<lb>
children. But though he left no wish of theirs ungratified,<lb>
he seemed to have forfeited his power to draw and hold<lb>
them to himself. He was more like an unobtrusive guest<lb>
than a master in his house. His children loved, but never<lb>
clung to him, because unseen yet impassible, rose the<lb>
<pb n="117">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-122">

<figdesc>Page 117.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
barrier of an instinctive protest against the wrong done their<lb>
dead mother, unconscious on their part but terribly significant<lb>
to him.</p>
<p>Mark had been years away; and though the brother and<lb>
sister were tenderly attached, sex, tastes, and pursuits kept<lb>
them too far apart, and Sylvia was solitary even in this<lb>
social seeming home. Dissatisfied with herself, she endeavored<lb>
to make her life what it should be with the energy<lb>
of an ardent, aspiring nature; and through all experiences,<lb>
sweet or bitter, all varying moods, successes and defeats, a<lb>
sincere desire for happiness the best and highest, was<lb>
the little rushlight of her soul that never wavered or went<lb>
out.</p>
<p>She never had known friendship in its truest sense, for<lb>
next to love it is the most abused of words. She had<lb>
called many &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; but was still ignorant of that sentiment,<lb>
cooler than passion, warmer than respect, more just<lb>
and generous than either, which recognizes a kindred spirit<lb>
in another, and claiming its right, keeps it sacred by the<lb>
wise reserve that is to friendship what the purple bloom is<lb>
to the grape, a charm which once destroyed can never be<lb>
restored. Love she had desired, yet dreaded, knowing her<lb>
own passionate nature, and when it came to her, making<lb>
that brief holiday the fateful point of her life, she gave<lb>
herself to it wholly. Before that time she had rejoiced<lb>
over a more tranquil pleasure, and believed that she had<lb>
found her friend in the neighbor who after long absence<lb>
had returned to his old place.</p>
<p>Nature had done much for Geoffrey Moor, but the wise<lb>
mother also gave him those teachers to whose hard lessons<lb>
she often leaves her dearest children. Five years spent in<lb>
the service of a sister, who, through the sharp discipline of<lb>
<pb n="118">

<figdesc>Page 118.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
pain was fitting her meek soul for heaven, had given him an<lb>
experience such as few young men receive. This fraternal<lb>
devotion proved a blessing in disguise; it preserved him<lb>
from any profanation of his youth, and the companionship<lb>
of the helpless creature whom he loved had proved an<lb>
ever present stimulant to all that was best and sweetest in<lb>
the man. A single duty faithfully performed had set the<lb>
seal of integrity upon his character, and given him grace to<lb>
see at thirty the rich compensation he had received for the<lb>
ambitions silently sacrificed at twenty five. When his<lb>
long vigil was over he looked into the world to find his place<lb>
again. But the old desires were dead, the old allurements<lb>
had lost their charm, and while he waited for time to show<lb>
him what good work he should espouse, no longing was so<lb>
strong as that for a home, where he might bless and be<lb>
blessed in writing that immortal poem a virtuous and<lb>
happy life.</p>
<p>Sylvia soon felt the power and beauty of this nature,<lb>
and remembering how well he had ministered to a physical<lb>
affliction, often looked into the face whose serenity was a<lb>
perpetual rebuke, longing to ask him to help and heal the<lb>
mental ills that perplexed and burdened her. Moor soon<lb>
divined the real isolation of the girl, read the language of<lb>
her wistful eyes, felt that he could serve her, and invited<lb>
confidence by the cordial alacrity with which he met her<lb>
least advance.</p>
<p>But while he served he learned to love her, for Sylvia,<lb>
humble in her own conceit, and guarded by the secret passion<lb>
that possessed her, freely showed the regard she felt,<lb>
with no thought of misapprehension, no fear of consequences.<lb>
Unconscious that such impulsive demonstration<lb>
made her only more attractive, that every manifestation of<lb>
<pb n="119">

<figdesc>Page 119.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her frank esteem was cherished in her friend's heart of<lb>
hearts, and that through her he was enjoying the blossom<lb>
time of life. So peacefully and pleasantly the summer<lb>
ripened into autumn and Sylvia's interest into an enduring<lb>
friendship.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Drawn</hi> curtains shut out the frosty night, the first fire<lb>
of the season burned upon the hearth, and basking in its<lb>
glow sat Sylvia, letting her thoughts wander where they<lb>
would. As books most freely open at pages oftenest read,<lb>
the romance of her summer life seldom failed to unclose at<lb>
passages where Warwick's name appeared. Pleasant as<lb>
were many hours of that time, none seemed so full of<lb>
beauty as those passed with him, and sweetest of them all<lb>
the twilight journey hand in hand. It now returned to<lb>
her so freshly that she seemed to hear again the evening<lb>
sounds, to feel the warm, fern-scented wind blow over her,<lb>
to see the strong hand offered helpfully, and with an impulse<lb>
past control she stretched her own to that visionary<lb>
Warwick as the longing of her heart found vent in an<lb>
eager</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice replied, a hand pressed hers, and springing up<lb>
she saw, not Adam, but Moor, standing beside her with a<lb>
beaming face. Concealing the thrill of joy, the pang of<lb>
pain he had brought her, she greeted him cordially, and<lb>
reseating herself, instinctively tried to turn the current of<lb>
her thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you came, for I have built castles in the air<lb>
long enough, and you will give me more substantial entertainment,<lb>
as you always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The broken dream had left tokens of its presence in the<lb>
unwonted warmth of Sylvia's manner; Moor felt it, and<lb>
for a moment did not answer. Much of her former shyness<lb>
had crept over her of late; she sometimes shunned him,<lb>
was less free in conversation, less frank in demonstration,<lb>
and once or twice had colored deeply as she caught his eye<lb>
upon her. These betrayals of Warwick's image in her<lb>
thoughts seemed to Moor the happy omens he had waited<lb>
eagerly to see, and each day his hope grew more assured.<lb>
He had watched her unseen while she was busied with her<lb>
mental pastime, and as he looked his heart had grown unspeakably<lb>
tender, for never had her power over him been<lb>
so fully felt, and never had he so longed to claim her in<lb>
the name of his exceeding love. A pleasant peace reigned<lb>
through the house, the girl sat waiting at his side, the moment<lb>
looked auspicious, the desire grew irresistible, and he<lb>
yielded to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are thinking of something new and pleasant to tell<lb>
me, I hope, &mdash; something in keeping with this quiet place<lb>
and hour,&rdquo; said Sylvia, glancing up at him with the traitorous<lb>
softness still in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and hoping you would like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have never heard it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, please; I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She folded her hands together on her knee, turned her<lb>
face attentively to his, and unwittingly composed herself to<lb>
listen to the sweet story so often told, and yet so hard to<lb>
tell. Moor meant to woo her very gently, for he believed<lb>
<pb n="122">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-127">

<figdesc>Page 122.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
that love was new to her. He had planned many graceful<lb>
illustrations for his tale, and rounded many smoothly flowing<lb>
sentences in which to unfold it. But the emotions are<lb>
not well bred, and when the moment came nature conquered<lb>
art. No demonstration seemed beautiful enough to<lb>
grace the betrayal of his passion, no language eloquent<lb>
enough to tell it, no power strong enough to hold in check<lb>
the impulse that mastered him. He went to her, knelt<lb>
down upon the cushion at her feet, and lifting to her a face<lb>
flushed and fervent with the ardor of a man's first love,<lb>
said impetuously &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, read it here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no need for her to look; act, touch, and tone<lb>
told the story better than the most impassioned speech.<lb>
The supplication of his attitude, the eager beating of his<lb>
heart, the tender pressure of his hand, dispelled her blindness<lb>
in the drawing of a breath, and showed her what she<lb>
had done. Now neglected warnings, selfish forgetfulness,<lb>
and the knowledge of an unconscious but irremediable<lb>
wrong frightened and bewildered her; she hid her face<lb>
and shrunk back trembling with remorse and shame.<lb>
Moor, seeing in her agitation only maiden happiness or<lb>
hesitancy, accepted and enjoyed a blissful moment while<lb>
he waited her reply. It was so long in coming that he<lb>
gently tried to draw her hands away and look into her<lb>
face, whispering like one scarcely doubtful of assent &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love me, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only half audible was the reluctant answer, yet he<lb>
heard it, smiled at what he fancied a shy falsehood, and<lb>
said tenderly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me love you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="123">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-128">

<figdesc>Page 123.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fainter than before was the one word, but it reached<lb>
and startled him. Hurriedly he asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I nothing to you but a friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick gesture he put down her hands and looked<lb>
at her. Grief, regret, and pity, filled her face with trouble,<lb>
but no love was there. He saw, yet would not believe the<lb>
truth, felt that the sweet certainty of love had gone, yet<lb>
could not relinquish the fond hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, I do! but I cannot say what you would have me,<lb>
and I must tell the truth, although it breaks my heart.<lb>
Geoffrey, I do not love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I not teach you?&rdquo; he pleaded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no desire to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Softly she spoke, remorseful she looked, but the words<lb>
wounded like a blow. All the glad assurance died, the<lb>
passionate glow faded, the caress, half tender, half timid,<lb>
fell away, and nothing of the happy lover remained in face<lb>
or figure. He rose slowly as if the heavy disappointment<lb>
oppressed both soul and body. He fixed on her a glance of<lb>
mingled incredulity, reproach, and pain, and said, like one<lb>
bent on ending suspense at once &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not see that I loved you? Can you have been<lb>
trifling with me? Sylvia, I thought you too simple and<lb>
sincere for heartless coquetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am! You shall not suspect me of that, though I deserve<lb>
all other reproaches. I have been very selfish, very<lb>
blind. I should have remembered that in your great kindness<lb>
you might like me too well for your own peace. I<lb>
should have believed Mark, and been less candid in my<lb>
<pb n="124">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-129">

<figdesc>Page 124.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
expressions of esteem. But I wanted a friend so much; I<lb>
found all I could ask in you; I thought my youth, my<lb>
faults, my follies, would make it impossible for you to see<lb>
in me anything but a wayward girl, who frankly showed<lb>
her regard, and was proud of yours. It was one of my sad<lb>
mistakes; I see it now; and now it is too late for anything<lb>
but penitence. Forgive me if you can; I've taken all the<lb>
pleasure, and left you all the pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia spoke in a paroxysm of remorseful sorrow. Moor<lb>
listened with a sinking heart, and when she dropped her<lb>
face into her hands again, unable to endure the pale expectancy<lb>
of his, he turned away, saying with an accent of<lb>
quiet despair &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have worked and waited all this summer to see<lb>
my harvest fail at last. Oh, Sylvia, I so loved, so trusted<lb>
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned his arm on the low chimney piece, laid down<lb>
his head upon it and stood silent, trying to forgive.</p>
<p>It is always a hard moment for any woman, when it demands<lb>
her bravest sincerity to look into a countenance of<lb>
eager love, and change it to one of bitter disappointment by<lb>
the utterance of a monosyllable. To Sylvia it was doubly<lb>
hard, for now her blindness seemed as ineredible as cruel;<lb>
her past frankness unjustifiable; her pleasure selfish; her<lb>
refusal the blackest ingratitude, and her dream of friendship<lb>
forever marred. In the brief pause that fell, every<lb>
little service he had rendered her, rose freshly in her memory;<lb>
every hour of real content and genuine worth that he<lb>
had given her, seemed to come back and reproach her;<lb>
every look, accent, action, of both happy past and sad present<lb>
seemed to plead for him. Her conscience cried out<lb>
against her, her heart overflowed with penitence and pity.<lb>
<pb n="125">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-130">

<figdesc>Page 125.</figdesc>

<milestn unit="collation" n="11*">
She looked at him, longing to say something, do something<lb>
that should prove her repentance, and assure him of the affection<lb>
which she felt. As she looked, two great tears fell<lb>
glittering to the hearth, and lay there such eloquent reproaches,<lb>
that, had Sylvia's heart been hard and cold as<lb>
the marble where they shone, it would have melted then.<lb>
She could not bear it, she went to him, took in both her<lb>
own the rejected hand that hung at his side, and feeling<lb>
that no act could too tenderly express her sorrow, lifted it<lb>
to her lips and softly kissed it.</p>
<p>An instant she was permitted to lay her cheek against it<lb>
as a penitent child mutelyy imploring pardon might have<lb>
done. Then it broke from her hold, and gathering her to<lb>
himself, Moor looked up exclaiming with renewed hope, unaltered<lb>
longing &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do care for me, then? You give yourself to me in<lb>
spite of that hard No? Ah, Sylvia, you are capricious<lb>
even in your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not answer, for if that first No had been hard<lb>
to utter, this was impossible. It seemed like turning the<lb>
knife in the wound, to disappoint the hope that had gathered<lb>
strength from despair, and she could only lay her head<lb>
down on his breast, weeping the saddest tears she had ever<lb>
shed. Still happy in his new delusion, Moor softly stroked<lb>
the shining hair, smiling so tenderly, so delightedly, that<lb>
it was well for her she did not see the smile, the words were<lb>
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sylvia, I have tried so hard to make you love me<lb>
how could you help it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reason sprung to her lips, but maiden pride and<lb>
shame withheld it. What could she tell except that she<lb>
had cherished a passion, based only on a look. She had<lb>
<pb n="126">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-131">

<figdesc>Page 126.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
deceived herself in her belief that Moor was but a friend,<lb>
might she not also have deceived herself in believing Warwick<lb>
was a lover? She could not own this secret, its betrayal<lb>
could not alter her reply, nor heal Moor's wound,<lb>
but the thought of Warwick strengthened her. It always<lb>
did, as surely as the influence of his friend always soothed<lb>
her, for one was an embodiment of power, the other of tenderness.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geoffrey, let me be true to you and to myself,&rdquo; she<lb>
said, so earnestly that it gave weight to her broken words.<lb>
&ldquo;I cannot be your wife, but I can be your dear friend forever.<lb>
Try to believe this, &mdash; make my task easier by giving<lb>
up your hope, &mdash; and oh, be sure that while I live I cannot<lb>
do enough to show my sorrow for the great wrong I have<lb>
done you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must it be so? I find it very hard to accept the truth<lb>
and give up the hope that has made my happiness so long.<lb>
Let me keep it, Sylvia; let me wait and work again. I<lb>
have a firm belief that you <hi rend="italics">will</hi> love me yet, because I<lb>
cleave to you with heart and soul, long for you continually,<lb>
and think you the one woman of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if it were only possible!&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me make it so! In truth, I think I should not<lb>
labor long. You are so young, dear, you have not learned<lb>
to know your own heart yet. It was not pity nor penitence<lb>
alone that brought you here to comfort me. Was it,<lb>
Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Had it been love, could I stand as I am now and<lb>
not show it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him, showed him that though her cheeks<lb>
were wet there was no rosy dawn of passion there; though<lb>
her eyes were as full of affection as of grief, there was no<lb>
<pb n="127">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-132">

<figdesc>Page 127.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
shy avoidance of his own, no dropping of the lids, lest they<lb>
should tell too much; and though his arm encircled her,<lb>
she did not cling to him as loving women cling when they<lb>
lean on the strength which, touched by love, can both<lb>
cherish and sustain. That look convinced him better than<lb>
a flood of words. A long sigh broke from his lips, and,<lb>
turning from her the eyes that had so wistfully searched<lb>
and found not, they went wandering drearily hither and<lb>
thither as if seeking the hope whose loss made life seem<lb>
desolate. Sylvia saw it, groaned within herself, but still<lb>
held fast to the hard truth, and tried to make it kinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geoffrey, I once heard you say to Mark, `Friendship<lb>
is the best college character can graduate from. Believe in<lb>
it, seek for it, and when it comes keep it as sacredly as<lb>
love.' All my life I have wanted a friend, have looked for<lb>
one, and when he came I welcomed him. May I not keep<lb>
him, and preserve the friendship dear and sacred still, although<lb>
I cannot offer love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Softly, seriously, she spoke, but the words sounded cold<lb>
to him; friendship seemed so poor now, love so rich, he<lb>
could not leave the blessed sunshine which transfigured the<lb>
whole earth and sit down in the little circle of a kindly<lb>
fire without keen regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say yes, I will try to do it if nothing easier<lb>
remains to me. Sylvia, for five years I have longed and<lb>
waited for a home. Duty forbade it then, because poor<lb>
Marion had only me to make her sad life happy, and my<lb>
mother left her to my charge. Now the duty is ended, the<lb>
old house very empty, my heart very hungry for affection.<lb>
You are all in all to me, and I find it so difficult to relinquish<lb>
my dream that I must be importunate. I have<lb>
spoken too soon, you have had no time to think, to look<lb>
<pb n="128">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-133">

<figdesc>Page 128.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
into yourself and question your own heart. Go, now, recall<lb>
what I have said, remember that I will wait for you<lb>
patiently, and when I leave, an hour hence, come down and<lb>
give me my last answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia was about to speak, but the sound of an approaching<lb>
step brought over her the shyness she had not felt before,<lb>
and without a word she darted from the room. Then romance<lb>
also fled, for Prue came bustling in, and Moor was<lb>
called to talk of influenzas while his thoughts were full of<lb>
love.</p>
<p>Alone in her chamber Sylvia searched herself. She pictured<lb>
the life that would be hers with Moor. The old<lb>
house so full of something better than its opulence, an<lb>
atmosphere of genial tranquillity which made it home-like<lb>
to whoever crossed its threshold. Herself the daily companion<lb>
and dear wife of the master who diffused such<lb>
sunshine there; whose serenity soothed her restlessness;<lb>
whose affection would be as enduring as his patience; whose<lb>
character she so truly honored. She felt that no woman<lb>
need ask a happier home, a truer or more tender lover.<lb>
But when she looked into herself she found the cordial, unimpassioned<lb>
sentiment he first inspired still unchanged, and<lb>
her heart answered &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of Warwick, and the other home that might<lb>
be hers. Fancy painted in glowing colors the stirring life,<lb>
the novelty, excitement, and ever new delight such wanderings<lb>
would have for her. The joy of being always with<lb>
him; the proud consciousness that she was nearest and<lb>
dearest to such a man; the certainty that she might share<lb>
the knowledge of his past, might enjoy his present, help to<lb>
shape his future. There was no time to look into her heart,<lb>
<pb n="129">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-134">

<figdesc>Page 129.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
for up sprung its warm blood to her check, its hope to her<lb>
eye, its longing to her lips, its answer glad and ready &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clock struck ten, and after lingering a little Sylvia<lb>
went down. Slowly, because her errand was a hard one;<lb>
thoughtfully, because she knew not where nor how she could<lb>
best deliver it. No need to look for him or linger for his<lb>
coming; he was already there. Alone in the hall, absently<lb>
smoothing a little silken shawl she often wore, and waiting<lb>
with a melancholy patience that smote her to the heart<lb>
He went to meet her, took both her hands in his, and looked<lb>
into her face so tenderly, so wistfully! &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, is it good night or good by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes filled, her hands trembled, her color paled, but<lb>
she answered steadily &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me; it is good by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Another</hi> gift for you, Sylvia. I don't know the writing,<lb>
but it smells like flowers,&rdquo; said Mark, as a smiling maid<lb>
brought in a package on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>Sylvia tore off the wrapper, lifted a cover, and exclaimed<lb>
with pleasure, though it was the simplest present she had<lb>
received that day. Only an osier basket, graceful in design<lb>
and shape, lined with moss, and filled with holly sprays,<lb>
the scarlet berries glowing beautifully among the polished<lb>
green. No note, no card, no hint of its donor anywhere<lb>
appeared, for none of them recognized the boldly written<lb>
address. Presently a thought came to Sylvia; in a moment<lb>
the mystery seemed to grow delightfully clear, and<lb>
she said to herself with a glow of joy, &ldquo;This is so like<lb>
Adam I know he sent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say it is the most peculiar present I ever saw,<lb>
and it is my belief that the boy who brought it stole whatever<lb>
article of value it contained, for it was very carelessly<lb>
done up. No person in their senses would send a few<lb>
sprigs of common holly to a young lady in this odd way,&rdquo;<lb>
said Prue, poking here and there in hopes of finding some<lb>
clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not common, but very beautiful; we seldom see<lb>
<pb n="131">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-136">

<figdesc>Page 131.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
any so large and green, and full of berries. Nor is it odd,<lb>
but very kind, because from the worn look of the wrapper<lb>
I know it has been sent a long way to please me. Look at<lb>
the little ferns in the moss, and smell the sweet moist odor<lb>
that seems to take us into summer woods in spite of a snowstorm.<lb>
Ah, he knew what I should like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knew?&rdquo; asked Mark, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must guess.&rdquo; And fearing that she had betrayed<lb>
herself, Sylvia hurried across the room to put the holly in<lb>
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha, I see,&rdquo; said Mark, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked Prue, looking mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geoffrey,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Yule, with an air of satisfaction.<lb>
</p>
<p>Then all three looked at one another, all three nodded<lb>
sagely, and all three glanced at the small person bending<lb>
over the table with cheeks almost as rosy as the berries in<lb>
her hand.</p>
<p>Every one knows what a Christmas party is when a general<lb>
friendliness pervades the air, and good wishes fly about<lb>
like <hi rend="italics">confetto</hi> during Carnival. To such an one went Sylvia<lb>
and Mark that night, the brother looking unusually blithe<lb>
and debonair, because the beloved Jessie had promised to be<lb>
there if certain aunts and uncles would go away in time;<lb>
the sister in a costume as pretty as appropriate, for snow<lb>
and holly made her a perfect Yule. Sylvia loved dancing,<lb>
and knew &ldquo;wall flowers&rdquo; only by sight; therefore she was<lb>
busy; her lover's gift shone greenly in bosom hair, and<lb>
fleecy skirts; therefore she was beautiful, and the thought<lb>
that Adam had not forgotten her lay warm at her heart;<lb>
therefore she was supremely happy. Mark was devoted,<lb>
but disappointed, for Jessie did not come, and having<lb>
<pb n="132">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-137">

<figdesc>Page 132.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
doomed the detaining aunts and uncles to a most unblessed<lb>
fate, he sought consolation among less fair damsels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go and enjoy yourself. I shall dance no more<lb>
round dances, for I'd rather not with any one but you, and<lb>
you have been a martyr long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark roamed away, and finding a cool corner Sylvia watched<lb>
the animated scene before her till her wandering glance was<lb>
arrested by the sight of a new comer, and her mind busied<lb>
with trying to recollect where she had seen him. The<lb>
slender figure, swarthy face, and vivacious eyes all seemed<lb>
familiar, but she could find no name for their possessor till<lb>
he caught her eye, when he half bowed and wholly smiled.<lb>
Then she remembered, and while still recalling that brief<lb>
interview one of their young hosts appeared with the<lb>
stranger, and Gabriel Andr&eacute; was duly presented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could hardly expect to be remembered, and am much<lb>
flattered, I assure you. Did you suffer from the shower<lb>
that day, Miss Yule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech was nothing, but the foreign accent gave a<lb>
softness to the words, and the southern grace of manner<lb>
gave an air of romance to the handsome youth. Sylvia<lb>
was in the mood to be pleased with everybody, everything,<lb>
and was unusually gracious as they merrily pursued the<lb>
subject suggested by his question. Presently he asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Warwick with you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not staying with us, but with his friend, Mr.<lb>
Moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the gentleman who pulled so well that day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Warwick with him still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he went away three months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="133">
<p>

<figdesc>Page 133.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="12">
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wish had been impulsively expressed, and was as<lb>
impulsively echoed. Young Andr&eacute; smiled, and liked Miss<lb>
Yule the better for forgetting that somewhat lofty air of<lb>
hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no conjecture, then? I wish to find him,<lb>
much, very much, but cannot put myself upon his trail.<lb>
He is so what you call peculiar that he writes no letters,<lb>
leaves no address, and roves here and there like a born<lb>
gitano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ill news for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the best a man could desire; but fear that while<lb>
I look for him he has gone to make a disappointment for<lb>
himself. You are a friend, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know much of him, his life, his ways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, both from himself and Mr. Moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know of his betrothal to my cousin, doubtless,<lb>
and I may speak of it, because if you will be so kind<lb>
you may perhaps help us to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know &mdash; perhaps he did not wish it &mdash;&rdquo; began<lb>
Sylvia, folding one hand tightly in the other, with a<lb>
quick breath and a momentary sensation as if some one had<lb>
struck her in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks so little of us I shall not regard his wish<lb>
just now. If you will permit me I would say a word for<lb>
my cousin's sake, as I know you will be interested for her,<lb>
and I do not feel myself strange with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia bowed, and standing before her with an air half<lb>
mannish, half boyish, Gabriel went on in the low, rapid<lb>
tone peculiar to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, then, my cousin was betrothed in May. A month<lb>
<pb n="134">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-139">

<figdesc>Page 134.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
after Adam cries out that he loves too much for his peace,<lb>
that he has no freedom of his heart or mind, that he must<lb>
go away and take his breath before he is made a happy<lb>
slave forever. Ottila told me this. She implored him to<lb>
stay; but no, he vows he will not come again till they<lb>
marry, in the next June. He thinks it a weakness to adore<lb>
a woman. Impertinente! I have no patience for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriel spoke indignantly, and pressed his foot into the<lb>
carpet with a scornful look. But Sylvia took no heed of<lb>
his petulance, she only kept her eyes fixed upon him with<lb>
an intentness which he mistook for interest. The eyes<lb>
were fine, the interest was flattering, and though quite<lb>
aware that he was both taking a liberty and committing a<lb>
breach of confidence, the impulsive young gentleman chose<lb>
to finish what he had begun, and trust that no harm would<lb>
follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been gone now more than half a year, but has<lb>
sent no letter, no message, nothing to show that he still<lb>
lives. Ottila waits, she writes, she grows too anxious to<lb>
endure, she comes to look for him. I help her, but we do<lb>
not find him yet, and meantime I amuse her. My friends<lb>
are kind, and we enjoy much as we look about us for this<lb>
truant Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Sylvia could have doubted the unexpected revelation,<lb>
this last trait was so like Warwick it convinced her at once.<lb>
Though the belief to which she had clung so long was suddenly<lb>
swept from under her, she floated silently with no<lb>
outward sign of shipwreck as her hope went down. Pride<lb>
was her shield, and crowding back all other emotions she<lb>
kept herself unnaturally calm behind it till she was alone.<lb>
If Gabriel had been watching her he would only have discovered<lb>
that she was a paler blonde than he had thought<lb>
<pb n="135">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-140">

<figdesc>Page 135.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her; that her address was more coldly charming than before;<lb>
and that her eye no longer met his, but rested<lb>
steadily on the folded fan she held. He was not watching<lb>
her, however, but glancing frequently over her head at<lb>
something at the far end of the rooms which a crowd of<lb>
assiduous gentlemen concealed. His eye wandered, but his<lb>
thoughts did not; for still intent on the purpose that seemed<lb>
to have brought him to her, he said, as if reluctant to be<lb>
importunate, yet resolved to satisfy himself &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me that I so poorly entertain you, and let me<lb>
ask one other question in Ottila's name. This Moor, would<lb>
he not give us some clue to Adam's haunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is absent, and will be till spring, I think. Where<lb>
I do not know, else I could write for you. Did Mr. Warwick<lb>
promise to return in June?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if he lives, he will come. Your cousin must<lb>
wait; it will not be in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man's voice was stern, and a passionate glitter<lb>
made his black eyes fierce. Then the former suavity<lb>
returned, and with his most gallant air he said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are kind, Miss Yule; I thank you, and put away<lb>
this so troublesome affair. May I have the honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had proposed to waltz over a precipice Sylvia felt<lb>
as if she could have accepted, provided there was time to<lb>
ask a question or two before the crash came. A moment<lb>
afterward Mark was surprised to see her floating round the<lb>
room on the arm of &ldquo;the olive-colored party,&rdquo; whom he<lb>
recognized at once. His surprise soon changed to pleasure,<lb>
for his beauty-loving eye as well as his brotherly pride was<lb>
gratified as the whirling couples subsided and the young<lb>

</eaffig>
pair went circling slowly by, giving to the graceful pastime<lb>
the enchantment few have skill to lend it, and making it a<lb>
spectacle of life-enjoying youth to be remembered by the<lb>
lookers on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! I have not enjoyed such a waltz since I<lb>
left Cuba. It is the rudest of rude things to say, but to<lb>
you I may confide it, because you dance like a Spaniard.<lb>
The ladies here seem to me as cold as their own snow, and<lb>
they make dancing a duty, not a pleasure. They should<lb>
see Ottila; she is all grace and fire. I could kill myself<lb>
dancing with her. Adam used to say it was like wine to<lb>
watch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she was here to give us a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is, but will not dance to-night.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, stopping abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Elyott is mad for her, and gave me no<lb>
peace till I brought her. She is behind that wall of men;<lb>
shall I make a passage for you? She will be glad to talk<lb>
with you of Adam, and I to show you the handsomest<lb>
woman in Haba&ntilde;a.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us wait a little; I should be afraid to talk before<lb>
so many. She is very beautiful, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will laugh and call me extravagant, as others do,<lb>
if I say what I think; so I will let you judge for yourself.<lb>
See, your brother stands on tiptoe to peep at her. Now<lb>
he goes in, and there he will stay. You do not like that,<lb>
perhaps. But Ottila cannot help her beauty, nor the power<lb>
she has of making all men love her. I wish she could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is gifted and accomplished, as well as lovely?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Sylvia, glancing at her companion's gloomy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is everything a woman should be, and I could<lb>
shoot Adam for his cruel neglect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gabriel's dark face kindled as he spoke, and Sylvia<lb>
drearily wished he would remember how ill-bred it was to<lb>
tire her with complaints of her friend, and raptures over<lb>
his cousin. He seemed to perceive this, turned a little<lb>
haughty at her silence, and when he spoke was all the<lb>
stranger again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a contra danza; shall we give the snow-ladies<lb>
another lesson? First, may I do myself the pleasure of<lb>
getting you an ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A glass of water, please; I am cool enough without<lb>
more ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seated her and went upon his errand. She <hi rend="italics">was</hi> cool<lb>
now; weary-footed, sick at heart, and yearning to be alone.<lb>
But in these days women do not tear their hair and make<lb>
scenes, though their hearts may ache and burn with the<lb>
same sharp suffering as of old. Till her brother came she<lb>
knew she must bear it, and make no sign. She did bear<lb>
it, drank the water with a smile, danced the dance with<lb>
spirit, and bore up bravely till Mark appeared. She was<lb>
alone just then, and his first words were &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; take me where I can, and tell me what you know<lb>
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, but that she is Andr&eacute;'s cousin, and he adores<lb>
her, as boys always do a charming woman who is kind to<lb>
them. Affect to be admiring these flowers, and look without<lb>
her knowing it, or she will frown at you like an insulted<lb>
princess, as she did at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked, saw the handsomest woman in Havana,<lb>
and hated her immediately. It was but natural, for Sylvia<lb>
was a very human girl, and Ottila one whom no woman<lb>
would love, however much she might admire.</p>
<pb n="138">

</p>
<p>Hers was that type of character which every age has<lb>
reproduced, varying externally with climates and conditions,<lb>
but materially the same since fabled Circe down to<lb>
Lola Montes, or some less famous syren whose subjects are<lb>
not kings. The same passions that in ancient days broke<lb>
out in heaven-defying crimes; the same power off beauty,<lb>
intellect, or subtlety; the same untamable spirit and lack<lb>
of moral sentiment are the attributes of all; latent or alert<lb>
as the noble or ignoble nature may predominate. Most of<lb>
us can recall some glimpse of such specimens of Nature's<lb>
work in a daring mood. Many of our own drawing-rooms<lb>
have held illustrations of the nobler type, and modern men<lb>
and women have quailed before royal eyes whose possessors<lb>
ruled all spirits but their own. Born in Athens, and endowed<lb>
with a finer intellect, Ottila might have been an<lb>
Aspasia; or cast in that great tragedy the French Revolution,<lb>
have played a brave part and died heroically like<lb>
Roland and Corday. But set down in uneventful times,<lb>
the courage, wit, and passion that might have served high<lb>
ends dwindled to their baser counterparts, and made her<lb>
what she was, &mdash; a fair allurement to the eyes of men, a<lb>
born rival to the peace of women, a rudderless nature absolute<lb>
as fate.</p>
<p>Sylvia possessed no knowledge that could analyze for her<lb>
the sentiment which repelled, even while it attracted her<lb>
toward Warwick's betrothed. That he loved her she did<lb>
not doubt, because she felt that even his pride would yield<lb>
to the potent fascination of this woman. As Sylvia looked,<lb>
her feminine eye took in every gift of face and figure, every<lb>
grace of attitude or gesture, every daintiness of costume,<lb>
and found no visible flaw in Ottila, from her haughty head<lb>
to her handsome foot. Yet, when her scrutiny ended, the<lb>
<pb n="139">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-144">

<figdesc>Page 139.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
girl felt a sense of disappointment, and no envy mingled<lb>
with her admiration.</p>
<p>As she stood, forgetting to assume interest in the camellias<lb>
before her, she saw Gabriel join his cousin, saw her<lb>
pause and look up at him with an anxious question. He<lb>
answered it, glancing toward that part of the room where<lb>
she was standing. Ottila's gaze was fixed upon her instantly;<lb>
a rapid, but keen survey followed, and then the<lb>
lustrous eyes turned away with such supreme indifference,<lb>
that Sylvia's blood tingled as if she had received an insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark, I am going home,&rdquo; she said, abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I'm ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When safe in her own room Sylvia's first act was to take<lb>
off the holly wreath, for her head throbbed with a heavy<lb>
pain that forbade hope of sleep that night. Looking at the<lb>
little chaplet so happily made, she saw that all the berries<lb>
had fallen, and nothing but the barbed leaves remained.<lb>
A sudden gesture crushed it in both her hands, and standing<lb>
so, she gathered many a scattered memory to confirm<lb>
that night's discovery.</p>
<p>Warwick had said, with such a tender accent in his voice,<lb>
&ldquo;I thought of the woman I would make my wife.&rdquo; That<lb>
was Ottila. He had asked so anxiously, &ldquo;If one should<lb>
keep a promise when it disturbed one's peace?&rdquo; That was<lb>
because he repented of his hasty vow to absent himself till<lb>
June. It was not love she saw in his eyes the night they<lb>
parted, but pity. He read her secret before that compassionate<lb>
glance revealed it to herself, and he had gone away<lb>
to spare her further folly. She had deceived herself, had<lb>
blindly cherished a baseless hope, and this was the end.<lb>
Even for the nameless gift she found a reason, with a woman's<lb>
skill, in self-torture. Moor had met Adam, had told<lb>
<pb n="140">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-145">

<figdesc>Page 140.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
his disappointment, and still pitying her Warwick had sent<lb>
the pretty greeting to console her for the loss of both friend<lb>
and lover.</p>
<p>This thought seemed to sting her into sudden passion.<lb>
As if longing to destroy every trace of her delusion, she<lb>
tore away the holly wreaths and flung them in the fire;<lb>
took down the bow and arrow Warwick had made her from<lb>
above the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;tag&egrave;re,</hi> where she had arranged the spoils of her<lb>
happy voyage, snapped them across her knee and sent them<lb>
after the holly; followed by the birch canoe, and every<lb>
pebble, moss, shell, or bunch of headed grass he had given<lb>
her then. The osier basket was not spared, the box went<lb>
next, and even the wrapper was on its way to immolation,<lb>
when, as she rent it apart, with a stern pleasure in the<lb>
sacrifice it was going to complete, from some close fold of<lb>
the paper hitherto undisturbed a card dropped at her feet.</p>
<p>She caught it up and read in handwriting almost as<lb>
familiar as her own: &ldquo;To Sylvia, &mdash; A merry Christmas<lb>
and best wishes from her friend, Geoffrey Moor.&rdquo; The word<lb>
&ldquo;friend&rdquo; was underscored, as if he desired to assure her<lb>
that he still cherished the only tie permitted him, and sent<lb>
the green token to lighten her regret that she could give no<lb>
more.</p>
<p>Warm over Sylvia's sore heart rushed the tender thought<lb>
and longing, as her tears began to flow. &ldquo;He cares for<lb>
me! he remembered me! I wish he would come back and<lb>
comfort me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is easy to say, &ldquo;I will forget,&rdquo; but perhaps the hardest<lb>
task given us is to lock up a natural yearning of the heart,<lb>
and turn a deaf ear to its plaint, for captive and jailer<lb>
must inhabit the same small cell. Sylvia was proud, with<lb>
that pride which is both sensitive and courageous, which<lb>
can not only suffer but wring strength from suffering.<lb>
While she struggled with a grief and shame that aged her<lb>
with their pain, she asked no help, made no complaint; but<lb>
when the forbidden passion stretched its arms to her, she<lb>
thrust it back and turned to pleasure for oblivion.</p>
<p>Those who knew her best were troubled and surprised by<lb>
the craving for excitement which now took possession of<lb>
her, the avidity with which she gratified it, regardless of<lb>
time, health, and money. All day she hurried here and<lb>
there, driving, shopping, sight-seeing, or entertaining guests,<lb>
at home. Night brought no cessation of her dissipation,<lb>
for when balls, masquerades, and concerts failed, there still<lb>
remained the theatre. This soon became both a refuge and<lb>
a solace, for believing it to be less harmful than other excitements,<lb>
her father indulged her new whim. But, had she<lb>
known it, this was the most dangerous pastime she could<lb>
have chosen. Calling for no exertion of her own, it left<lb>
her free to passively receive a stimulant to her unhappy love<lb>
<pb n="142">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-147">

<figdesc>Page 142.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
in watching its mimic semblance through all phases of<lb>
tragic suffering and sorrow, for she would see no comedies,<lb>
and Shakespeare's tragedies became her study.</p>
<p>This lasted for a time, then the reaction came. A black<lb>
melancholy fell upon her, and energy deserted soul and<lb>
body. She found it a weariness to get up in the morning<lb>
and weariness to lie down at night. She no longer cared<lb>
even to seem cheerful, owned that she was spiritless, hoped<lb>
she should be ill, and did not care if she died to-morrow.<lb>
When this dark mood seemed about to become chronic she<lb>
began to mend, for youth is wonderfully recuperative, and<lb>
the deepest wounds soon heal even against the sufferer's<lb>
will. A quiet apathy replaced the gloom, and she let the<lb>
tide drift her where it would, hoping nothing, expecting<lb>
nothing, asking nothing but that she need not suffer any<lb>
more.</p>
<p>She lived fast; all processes with her were rapid; and the<lb>
secret experience of that winter taught her many things.<lb>
She believed it had only taught her to forget, for now the<lb>
outcast love lay very still, and no longer beat despairingly<lb>
against the door of her heart, demanding to be taken in<lb>
from the cold. She fancied that neglect had killed it, and<lb>
that its grave was green with many tears. Alas for Sylvia!<lb>
how could she know that it had only sobbed itself to sleep,<lb>
and would wake beautiful and strong at the first sound of<lb>
its master's voice.</p>
<p>Mark became eventful. In his fitful fashion he had<lb>
painted a picture of the Golden Wedding, from sketches<lb>
taken at the time. Moor had suggested and bespoken it,<lb>
that the young artist might have a motive for finishing it,<lb>
because, though he excelled in scenes of that description, he<lb>
thought them beneath him, and tempted by more ambitious<lb>
<pb n="143">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-148">

<figdesc>Page 143.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
designs, neglected his true branch of the art. In April it<lb>
was finished, and at his father's request Mark reluctantly<lb>
sent it with his Clytemnestra to the annual exhibition. One<lb>
morning at breakfast Mr. Yule suddenly laughed out behind<lb>
his paper, and with a face of unmixed satisfaction<lb>
passed it to his son, pointing to a long critique upon the<lb>
Exhibition. Mark prepared himself to receive with becoming<lb>
modesty the praises lavished upon his great work, but<lb>
was stricken with amazement to find Clytemnestra disposed<lb>
of in a single sentence, and the Golden Wedding lauded in<lb>
a long enthusiastic written paragraph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce does the man mean!&rdquo; he ejaculated,<lb>
staring at his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means that the work which warms the heart is<lb>
greater than that which freezes the blood, I suspect. Moor<lb>
knew what you could do and has made you do it, sure that<lb>
if you worked for fame unconsciously you should achieve it.<lb>
This is a success that I can appreciate, and I congratulate<lb>
you heartily, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. But upon my word I don't understand<lb>
it, and if this was n't written by the best Art critic<lb>
in the country I should feel inclined to say the writer was<lb>
a fool. Why that little thing was a daub compared to the<lb>
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no farther in his protest against this unexpected<lb>
freak of fortune, for Sylvia seized the paper and read the<lb>
paragraph aloud with such happy emphasis amid Prue's<lb>
outcries and his father's applause, that Mark began to feel<lb>
that he really had done something praiseworthy, and that<lb>
the &ldquo;daub&rdquo; was not so despicable after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm going to look at it from this new point of sight,&rdquo;<lb>
was his sole comment as he went away.</p>
<pb n="144">

<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-149">

</p>
<p>Three hours afterward he appeared to Sylvia as she sat<lb>
sewing alone, and startled her with the mysterious announcement.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done what? Have you burnt poor Clytemnestra?&rdquo;<lb>
&ldquo;Hang Clytemnestra! I'll begin at the beginning and<lb>
prepare you for the grand finale. I went to the Exhibition,<lb>
and stared at Father Blake and his family for an hour.<lb>
Decided that was n't bad, though I still admire the other<lb>
more. Then people began to come and crowd up, so that I<lb>
slipped away for I could n't stand the compliments. Dahlmann,<lb>
Scott, and all the rest of my tribe were there, and,<lb>
as true as my name is Mark Yule, every man of them<lb>
ignored the Greek party and congratulated me upon the<lb>
success of that confounded Golden Wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest boy, I am so proud! so glad! What is the<lb>
matter? Have you been bitten by a tarantula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She might well ask, for Mark was dancing all over the<lb>
carpet in a most extraordinary style, and only stopped long<lb>
enough to throw a little case into Sylvia's lap, asking as a<lb>
whole faceful of smiles broke loose &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened it, and a suspicious circlet of diamonds appeared,<lb>
at sight of which she clapped her hands, and cried<lb>
out &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You 're going to ask Jessie to wear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have! I have!&rdquo; sung Mark, dancing more wildly<lb>
than ever. Sylvia chased him into a corner and held him<lb>
there, almost as much excited as he, while she demanded a<lb>
full explanation, which he gave her, laughing like a boy,<lb>
and blushing like a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no business to ask, but of course I'm dying<lb>

<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-150">

<figdesc>Page 145.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="13">
to tell you. I went from that Painter's Purgatory as we<lb>
call it, to Mr. Hope's, and asked for Miss Jessie. My angel<lb>
came down; I told her of my success, and she smiled as<lb>
never a woman did before; I added that I'd only waited to<lb>
make myself more worthy of her, by showing that I had<lb>
talent, as well as love and money to offer her, and she began<lb>
to cry, whereat I took her in my arms and ascended<lb>
straight into heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please be sobor, Mark, and tell me all about it. Was<lb>
she glad? Did she say she would? And is everything<lb>
as we would have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all perfect, divine, and rapturous, to the last degree.<lb>
Jessie has liked me ever since she was born, she<lb>
thinks; adores you and Prue for sisters; yearns to call my<lb>
parent father; allowed me to say and do whatever I liked,<lb>
and gave me a ravishing kiss just there. Sacred spot; I<lb>
shall get a mate to it when I put this on her blessed little<lb>
finger. Try it for me, I want it to be right, and your hands<lb>
are of a size. That fits grandly. When shall I see a joyful<lb>
sweetheart doing this on his own behalf, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook off the ring as if it burnt her, watching it roll<lb>
glittering away, with a somewhat tragical expression. Then<lb>
she calmed herself, and sitting down to her work, enjoyed<lb>
Mark's raptures for an hour.</p>
<p>The distant city bells were ringing nine that night as a<lb>
man paused before Mr. Yule's house, and attentively scrutinized<lb>
each window. Many were alight, but on the drawn<lb>
curtain of one a woman's shadow came and went. He<lb>
watched it a moment, passed up the steps, and noiselessly<lb>
went in. The hall was bright and solitary; from above<lb>
came the sound of voices, from a room to the right, the stir<lb>
<pb n="146">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-151">

<figdesc>Page 146.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of papers and the scratch of a pen, from one on the left, a<lb>
steady rustle as of silk, swept slowly to and fro. To the<lb>
threshold of this door the man stepped and looked in.</p>
<p>Sylvia was just turning in her walk, and as she came<lb>
musing down the room, Moor saw her well. With some<lb>
women dress has no relation to states of mind; with Sylvia<lb>
it was often an indication of the mental garb she wore.<lb>
Moor remembered this trait, and saw in both countenance<lb>
and costume the change that had befallen her in his long<lb>
absence. Her face was neither gay nor melancholy, but<lb>
serious and coldly quiet, as if some inward twilight reigned.<lb>
Her dress, a soft, sad grey, with no decoration but a<lb>
knot of snowdrops in her bosom. On these pale flowers her<lb>
eyes were fixed, and as she walked with folded arms and<lb>
drooping head, she sang low to herself &mdash;</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>`Upon the convent roof, the snows</l>
<l rend="indent">Lie sparkling to the moon;</l>
<l>My breath to heaven like incense goes,</l>
<l rend="indent">May my soul follow soon.</l>
<l>Lord, make my spirit pure and clear,</l>
<l rend="indent">As are the frosty skies,</l>
<l>Or this first snowdrop of the year,</l>
<l rend="indent">That in my bosom lies.'</l>
</lg></q>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very gentle was the call, but she started as if it had been<lb>
a shout, looked an instant while light and color flashed into<lb>
her face, then ran to him exclaiming joyfully &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Geoffrey! I am glad! I am glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be but one answer to such a welcome, and<lb>
Sylvia received it as she stood there, not weeping now, but<lb>
smiling with the sincerest satisfaction, the happiest surprise.<lb>
Moor shared both emotions, feeling as a man might feel<lb>
<pb n="147">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-152">

<figdesc>Page 147.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
when, parched with thirst, he stretches out his hand for a<lb>
drop of rain, and receives a brimming cup of water. He<lb>
drank a deep draught gratefully, then, fearing that it might<lb>
be as suddenly withdrawn, asked anxiously &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, are we friends or lovers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything, if you will only stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up as she spoke, and her face betrayed that a<lb>
conflict between desire and doubt was going on within her.<lb>
Impulse had sent her there, and now it was so sweet to<lb>
know herself beloved, she found it hard to go away. Her<lb>
brother's happiness had touched her heart, roused the old<lb>
craving for affection, and brought a strong desire to fill the<lb>
aching void her lost love had left with this recovered one.<lb>
Sylvia had not learned to reason yet, she could only feel,<lb>
because, owing to the unequal development of her divided<lb>
nature, the heart grew faster than the intellect. Instinct<lb>
was her surest guide, and when she followed it unblinded<lb>
by a passion, unthwarted by a mood, she prospered. But<lb>
now she was so blinded and so thwarted, and now her great<lb>
temptation came. Ambition, man's idol, had tempted the<lb>
father; love, woman's god, tempted the daughter; and, as<lb>
if the father's atonement was to be wrought out through his<lb>
dearest child, the daughter also made the fatal false step of<lb>
her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you <hi rend="italics">have</hi> learned to love me, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the old feeling has not changed except to grow<lb>
more remorseful, more eager to prove its truth. Once you<lb>
asked me if I did not wish to love you; then I did not,<lb>
now I sincerely do. If you still want me with my many<lb>
faults, and will teach me in your gentle way to be all I<lb>
should to you, I will gladly learn, because I never needed<lb>
love as I do now. Geoffrey, shall I stay or go?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="148">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-153">

<figdesc>Page 148.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Sylvia. Ah, thank God for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had ever hoped that Moor would forget her for his<lb>
own sake, she now saw how vain such hope would have been,<lb>
and was both touched and troubled by the knowledge of<lb>
her supremacy which that hour gave her. She was as much<lb>
the calmer as friendship is than love, and was the first to<lb>
speak again, still standing there content although her words<lb>
expressed a doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very sure you want me? Are you not tired of<lb>
the thorn that has fretted you so long? Remember, I am<lb>
so young, so ignorant, and unfitted for a wife. Can I give<lb>
you real happiness? make home what you would have it?<lb>
and never see in your face regret that some wiser, better<lb>
woman was not in my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of myself, and satisfied with you, as you are<lb>
no wiser, no better, nothing but my Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very sweet to hear you say that with such a look.<lb>
I do not deserve it but I will. Is the pain I once gave you<lb>
gone now, Geoffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am satisfied, and will begin my life anew by<lb>
trying to learn well the lesson my kind master is to teach<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Moor went that night Sylvia followed him, and as<lb>
they stood together this happy moment seemed to recall that<lb>
other sad one, for taking her hands again he asked, smiling<lb>
now &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, is it good night or good by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good by and come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nothing</hi> could have been more unlike than the two pairs<lb>
of lovers who from April to August haunted Mr. Yule's<lb>
house. One pair was of the popular order, for Mark was<lb>
tenderly tyrannical, Jessie adoringly submissive, and at all<lb>
hours of the day they were to be seen making tableaux of<lb>
themselves. The other pair were of the peculiar order,<lb>
undemonstrative and unsentimental, but quite as happy.<lb>
Moor knew his power, but used it generously, asking little<lb>
while giving much. Sylvia as yet found nothing to regret,<lb>
for so gently was she taught, the lesson could not seem<lb>
hard, and when her affection remained unchanged in kind,<lb>
although it deepened in degree, she said within herself &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That strong and sudden passion was not true love, but<lb>
an unwise, unhappy delusion of my own. I should be glad<lb>
that it is gone, because I know I am not fit to be Warwick's<lb>
wife. This quiet feeling which Geoffrey inspires must be<lb>
a safer love for me, and I should be grateful that in making<lb>
his happiness I may yet find my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried heartily to forget herself in others, unconscious<lb>
that there are times when the duty we owe ourselves is<lb>
greater than that we owe to them. In the atmosphere of<lb>
cheerfulness that now surrounded her she could not but be<lb>
cheerful, and soon it would have been difficult to find a<lb>
<pb n="150">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-155">

<figdesc>Page 150.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
more harmonious household than this. One little cloud<lb>
alone remained to mar the general sunshine. Mark was<lb>
in a frenzy to be married, but had set his heart on a double<lb>
wedding, and Sylvia would not fix the time, always pleading&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be quite sure of myself before I take this step,<lb>
and do not wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matters stood thus till Mark, having prepared his honeymoon<lb>
cottage, as a relief to his impatience, found it so irresistible<lb>
that he announced his marriage for the first of<lb>
August, and declared no human power should change his<lb>
purpose. Sylvia promised to think of it, but gave no decided<lb>
answer, for though she would hardly own it to<lb>
herself she longed to remain free till June was past. It<lb>
came and went without a sign, and July began before the<lb>
longing died a sudden death, and she consented to be<lb>
married.</p>
<p>Mark and Jessie came in from the city one warm morning<lb>
and found Sylvia sitting idly in the hall. She left her<lb>
preparations all to Prue, who revelled in such things, and<lb>
applied herself diligently to her lesson as if afraid she<lb>
might not learn it as she should. Half way up stairs Mark<lb>
turned and said, laughing &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, I saw Searle to-day, &mdash; one of the fellows whom<lb>
we met on the river last summer, &mdash; and he began to tell<lb>
me something about Andr&eacute; and the splendid cousin, who is<lb>
married and gone abroad it seems. I did not hear much,<lb>
for Jessie was waiting; but you remember the handsome<lb>
Cubans we saw at Christmas, don't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought you 'd like to know that the lad had<lb>
gone home to Cleopatra's wedding, so you cannot have him<lb>
<pb n="151">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-156">

<figdesc>Page 151.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to dance at yours. Have you forgotten how you waltzed<lb>
that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I've not forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark went off to consult Prue, and Jessie began to display<lb>
her purchases before eyes that only saw a blur of<lb>
shapes and colors, and expatiate upon their beauties to ears<lb>
that only heard the words &mdash; &ldquo;The splendid cousin is married<lb>
and gone abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should enjoy these pretty things a thousand times<lb>
more if you would please us all by being married when we<lb>
are,&rdquo; sighed Jessie, looking at her pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, really? Sylvia, you are a perfect darling!<lb>
Mark! Prue! she says she will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away flew Jessie to proclaim the glad tidings, and Sylvia,<lb>
with a curious expression of relief, regret, and resolve, repeated<lb>
to herself that decided &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one took care that Miss Caprice should not have<lb>
time to change her mind. The whole house was soon in a<lb>
bustle, for Prue ruled supreme. Mr. Yule fled from the<lb>
din of women's tongues, the bridegrooms were kept on a<lb>
very short allowance of bride, and Sylvia and Jessie were<lb>
almost invisible, for milliners and mantua-makers swarmed<lb>
about them till they felt like animated pin-cushions. The<lb>
last evening came at length, and Sylvia was just planning<lb>
an escape into the garden when Prue, whose tongue wagged<lb>
as rapidly as her hands worked, exclaimed &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you stand staring out of window when there<lb>
is so much to do? Here are all these trunks to pack,<lb>
Maria in her bed with every tooth in a frightful state of<lb>
inflammation, and that capable Jane What 's-her-name gone<lb>
<pb n="152">

</eaffig>
off while I was putting a chamomile poultice on her face.<lb>
If you are tired sit down and try on all your shoes, for though<lb>
Mr. Peggit has your measure, those absurd clerks seem to<lb>
think it a compliment to send children's sizes to grown<lb>
women. I'm sure my rubbers were a perfect insult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia sat down, tugged on one boot and fell into a<lb>
reverie with the other in her hand, while Prue clacked on<lb>
like a wordmill in full operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I'm ever to get all these gowns into that trunk<lb>
passes my comprehension. There 's a tray for each, of<lb>
course; but a ball dress is such a fractious thing. I could<lb>
shake that Antoinette Roche for disappointing you at the<lb>
last minute; and what you are to do for a maid, I don't<lb>
know. You 'll have so much dressing to do you will be<lb>
quite worn out; and I want you to look your best on all<lb>
occasions, for you will meet everybody. This collar won't<lb>
wear well; Clara has n't a particle of judgment, though<lb>
her taste is sweet. These hose, now, are a good, firm<lb>
article; I chose them myself. Do be sure you get all your<lb>
things from the wash. At those great hotels there 's a deal<lb>
of pilfering, and you are so careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Sylvia came out of her reverie with a sigh that was<lb>
almost a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't they fit? I knew they would n't!&rdquo; said Prue,<lb>
with an air of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boots suit me, but the hotels do not; and if it was<lb>
not ungrateful, after all your trouble, I should like to make<lb>
a bonfire of this roomful of haberdashery, and walk quietly<lb>
away to my new home by the light of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the bare idea of such an awful proceeding robbed<lb>
her of all strength, Miss Yule sat suddenly down in the<lb>
trunk by which she was standing. Fortunately it was<lb>
<pb n="153">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-158">

<figdesc>Page 153.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
nearly full, but her appearance was decidedly ludicrous as<lb>
she sat with the collar in one uplifted hand, the hose in the<lb>
other, and the ball dress laid over her lap like a fainting<lb>
lady; while she said, with imploring solemnity, which<lb>
changed abruptly from the pathetic to the comic at the end<lb>
of her speech &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, if I ever cherished a wish in this world of disappointment,<lb>
it is that your wedding shall have nothing<lb>
peculiar about it, because every friend and relation you 've<lb>
got expects it. Do let me have the comfort of knowing<lb>
that every one was surprised and pleased; for if the expression<lb>
was elegant (which it is n't, and only suggested by<lb>
my trials with those dressmakers), I should say I was on<lb>
pins and needles till it 's all over. Bless me! and so I am,<lb>
for here are three on the floor and one in my shoe.&rdquo; Prue<lb>
paused to extract the appropriate figure of speech which she<lb>
had chosen, and Sylvia said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have everything else as you wish it, would you<lb>
mind if we did n't go the journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I should. Every one goes a wedding trip,<lb>
its part of the ceremony; and if two carriages and two<lb>
bridal pairs don't leave here to-morrow, I shall feel as if all<lb>
my trouble had been thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll go, Prue, I'll go; and you shall be satisfied. But<lb>
I thought we might go from here in style, and then slip off<lb>
on some quieter trip. I am so tired I dread the idea of<lb>
frolicking for a whole month, as Mark and Jessie mean<lb>
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Prue's turn to groan now, and she did so dismally.<lb>
But Sylvia had never asked a favor in vain, and<lb>
this was not the moment to refuse to her anything, so<lb>
worldly pride yielded to sisterly affection, and Prue said<lb>
<pb n="154">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-159">

<figdesc>Page 154.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with resignation, as she fell to work more vigorously than<lb>
ever, because she had wasted five good minutes &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you like, dear, you shall not be crossed on your<lb>
last day at home. Ask Geoffrey, and if you are happy I'm<lb>
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Sylvia could thank her sister there came a tap<lb>
and a voice asking &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can get in,&rdquo; answered Prue, as, reversing her<lb>
plan in her hurry, she whisked the collar into a piecebag<lb>
and the hose into a bandbox.</p>
<p>Moor paused on the threshold in a masculine maze, that<lb>
one small person could need so much drapery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I borrow Sylvia for a little while? A breath of<lb>
air will do her good, and I want her bright and blooming<lb>
for to-morrow, else young Mrs. Yule will outshine young<lb>
Mrs. Moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a thoughtful creature you are, Geoffrey. Take<lb>
her and welcome, only pray put on a shawl, Sylvia, and<lb>
don't stay out late, for a bride with a cold in her head is<lb>
the saddest of spectacles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glad to be released Sylvia went away, and, dropping the<lb>
shawl as soon as she was out of Prue's sight, paced up and<lb>
down the garden walks upon her lover's arm. Having<lb>
heard her wish and given a hearty assent Moor asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we go? Tell me what you would like<lb>
best and you shall have it. You will not let me give you<lb>
many gifts, but this pleasure you will accept from me I<lb>
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give me yourself, that is more than I deserve.<lb>
But I should like to have you take me to the place you like<lb>
best. Don't tell me beforehand, let it be a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="155">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-160">

<figdesc>Page 155.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, it is already settled, and I know you will like<lb>
it. Is there no other wish to be granted, no doubt to be<lb>
set at rest, or regret withheld that I should know. Tell<lb>
me, Sylvia, for if ever there should be confidence between<lb>
us it is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the desire to tell him of her love for Adam<lb>
rose within her, but with the desire came a thought that<lb>
modified the form in which impulse prompted her to make<lb>
confession. Moor was both sensitive and proud, would not<lb>
the knowledge of the fact mar for him the friendship that<lb>
was so much to both? From Warwick he would never<lb>
learn it, from her he should have only a half confidence,<lb>
and so love both friend and wife with an untroubled heart.<lb>
Few of us can always control the rebellious nature that so<lb>
often betrays and then reproaches, few always weigh the<lb>
moment and the act that bans or blesses it, and where is<lb>
the life that has not known some turning-point when a<lb>
fugitive emotion has decided great issues for good or ill?<lb>
Such an emotion came to Sylvia then, and another temptation,<lb>
wearing the guise of generosity, urged her to another<lb>
false step, for when the first is taken a second inevitably<lb>
follows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish, no regret, nothing but the old doubt<lb>
of my unstable self, and the fear that I may fail to make<lb>
you happy. But I should like to tell you something. I<lb>
don't know that you will care for it, or that there is any<lb>
need to tell it, but when you said there should be confidence<lb>
between us, I felt that I wanted you to know that I<lb>
had loved some one before I loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not see her face, he only heard her quiet voice.<lb>
He had no thought of Adam, whom she had known so short<lb>
a time, who was already bound; he only fancied that she<lb>
<pb n="156">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-161">

<figdesc>Page 156.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
spoke of some young lover who had touched her heart, and<lb>
while he smiled at the nice sense of honor that prompted<lb>
the innocent confession, he said, with no coldness, no curiosity<lb>
in voice or face &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to tell it, dear. I have no jealousy of any one<lb>
who has gone before me. Rest assured of this, for if I<lb>
could not share so large a heart with one who will never<lb>
claim my share I should not deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so like you! Now I am quite at ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at her as she went beside him, thinking<lb>
that of all the brides he had ever seen his own looked least<lb>
like one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought that you would make a very ardent<lb>
lover, Sylvia. That you would be excited, gay, and brilliant<lb>
at a time like this. But you are so quiet, so absorbed,<lb>
and so unlike your former self that I begin to think I do<lb>
not know you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will in time. I am passionate and restless by<lb>
nature, but I am also very sensitive to all influences, personal<lb>
or otherwise, and were you different from your tranquil,<lb>
sunshiny self, I too should change. I am quiet because<lb>
I seem in a pleasant state, half waking, half dreaming,<lb>
from which I never wish to wake. I am tired of the<lb>
past, contented with the present, and to you I leave the<lb>
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be a happy one if I can make it so, and to-morrow<lb>
you will give me the dear right to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and thinking of the solemn promises to<lb>
be then made, she added, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I think I love, I<lb>
know I honor, I will try to obey. Can I do more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well for them both if they could have known that friendship<lb>
is love's twin, and the gentle sisters are too often<lb>
<pb n="157">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-162">

<figdesc>Page 157.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
mistaken for each other. That Sylvia was innocently deceiving<lb>
both her lover and herself, by wrapping her friendship<lb>
in the garb her lost love had worn, forgetting that the wanderer<lb>
might return and claim its own, leaving the other to<lb>
suffer for the borrowed warmth. They did not know it,<lb>
and walked tranquilly together in the summer night, planning<lb>
the new life as they went, and when they parted Moor<lb>
pointed to a young moon hanging in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Sylvia, our honeymoon has risen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it be a happy one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be, and when the anniversary of this glad night<lb>
comes round it shall be shining still. God bless my little<lb>
wife.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sylvia</hi> was awakened on her wedding morning by a<lb>
curious choking sound, and starting up found Prue crying<lb>
over her as if her heart were broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened? Is Geoffrey ill? Is all the<lb>
silver stolen? Can't the Bishop come?&rdquo; she asked, wondering<lb>
what calamity could move her sister to tears at such<lb>
a busy time.</p>
<p>Prue took Sylvia in her arms, and rocking to and fro as<lb>
if she were still a baby, poured forth a stream of words<lb>
and tears together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened; I came to call you, and broke<lb>
down because it was the last time I should do it. I've<lb>
been awake all night, thinking of you and all you 've<lb>
been to me since I took you in my arms nineteen years ago,<lb>
and said you should be mine. My little Sylvia, I've been<lb>
neglectful of so many things, and now I see them all; I've<lb>
fretted you with my ways, and have n't been patient enough<lb>
with yours; I've been selfish even about your wedding, and<lb>
it won't be as you like it; you 'll reproach me in your heart,<lb>
and I shall hate myself for it when you are gone never to<lb>
be my care and comfort any more. And &mdash; oh, my dear,<lb>
my dear, what shall I do without you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This unexpected demonstration from her prosaic sister<lb>
<pb n="159">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-164">

<figdesc>Page 159.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
touched Sylvia more than the most sentimental lamentations<lb>
from another. It brought to mind all the past devotion,<lb>
the future solitude of Prue's life, and she clung about<lb>
her neck tearless but very tender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never shall reproach you, never cease to love and<lb>
thank you for all you 've been to me, my dear old girl.<lb>
You must n't grieve over me, or think I shall forget you, for<lb>
you never shall be forsaken; and very soon I shall be back,<lb>
almost as much your Sylvia as ever. Mark will live on one<lb>
side, I shall live on the other, and we 'll be merry and cosy<lb>
together. And who knows but when we are both out of<lb>
your way you will learn to think of yourself and marry<lb>
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Prue began to laugh hysterically, and exclaimed,<lb>
with more than her usual incoherency &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell you, it was so very odd! I did n't mean<lb>
to do so, because you children would tease me; but now I<lb>
will to make you laugh, for it 's a bad omen to cry over<lb>
a bride, they say. My dear, that gouty Mr. MacGregor,<lb>
when I went in with some of my nice broth last week<lb>
(Hugh slops so, and he 's such a fidget. I took it myself),<lb>
after he had eaten every drop before my eyes, wiped his<lb>
mouth and asked me to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would not, Prue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, child, how could I? I must take care of my<lb>
poor dear father, and he is n't pleasant in the least, you<lb>
know, but would wear my life out in a week. I really<lb>
pitied him, however, when I refused him, with a napkin<lb>
round his neck, and he tapped his waistcoat with a spoon<lb>
so comically, when he offered me his heart, as if it were<lb>
something good to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very funny! What made him do it, Prue?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="160">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-165">

<figdesc>Page 160.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he 'd watched the preparations from his window,<lb>
and got so interested in weddings that he wanted one<lb>
himself, and felt drawn to me I was so sympathetic. That<lb>
means a good nurse and cook, my dear. I understand these<lb>
invalid gentlemen, and will be a slave to no man so fat and<lb>
fussy as Mr. Mac, as my brother calls him. It 's not respectful,<lb>
but I like to refresh myself by saying it just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the old soul, Prue, but go and have your<lb>
breakfast comfortably, for there 's much to be done, and<lb>
no one is to dress me but your own dear self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Prue relapsed into the pathetic again, and cried<lb>
over her sister as if, despite the omen, brides were plants<lb>
that needed much watering.</p>
<p>The appearance of the afflicted Maria, with her face still<lb>
partially eclipsed by the chamomile comforter, and an announcement<lb>
that the waiters had come and were &ldquo;ordering<lb>
round dreadful,&rdquo; caused Prue to pocket her handkerchief<lb>
and descend to turn the tables in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>The prospect of the wedding breakfast made the usual<lb>
meal a mere mockery. Every one was in a driving hurry,<lb>
every one was very much excited, and nobody but Prue and<lb>
the colored gentlemen brought anything to pass. Sylvia<lb>
went from room to room bidding them good by as the child<lb>
who had played there so long. But each looked unfamiliar<lb>
in its state and festival array, and the old house seemed<lb>
to have forgotten her already. She spent an hour with her<lb>
father, paid Mark a little call in the studio where he was<lb>
bidding adieu to the joys of bachelorhood, and preparing<lb>
himself for the jars of matrimony by a composing smoke,<lb>
and then Prue claimed her.</p>
<p>The agonies she suffered during that long toilet are beyond<lb>
the powers of language to portray, for Prue surpassed<lb>
<pb n="161">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-166">

<figdesc>Page 161.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="14 *">
herself and was the very essence of fussiness. But Sylvia<lb>
bore it patiently as a last sacrifice, because her sister was<lb>
very tender-hearted still, and laughed and cried over her<lb>
work till all was done, when she surveyed the effect with<lb>
pensive satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very sweet, my dear, and so delightfully calm,<lb>
you really do surprise me. I always thought you 'd have<lb>
hysterics on your wedding-day, and got my <hi rend="italics">vinaigrette</hi> all<lb>
ready. Keep your hands just as they are, with the handkerchief<lb>
and bouquet, it looks very easy and rich. Dear me,<lb>
what a spectacle I've made of myself! But I shall cry no<lb>
more, not even during the ceremony as many do. Such<lb>
displays of feeling are in very bad taste, and I shall be firm,<lb>
perfectly firm, so if you hear any one sniff you 'll know it<lb>
isn't me. Now I must go and scramble on my dress;<lb>
first, let me arrange you smoothly in a chair. There, my<lb>
precious, now think of soothing things, and don't stir<lb>
till Geoffrey comes for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too tired to care what happened just then, Sylvia sat as<lb>
she was placed, feeling like a fashion-plate of a bride, and<lb>
wishing she could go to sleep Presently the sound of steps<lb>
as fleet as Mark's but lighter, waked her up, and forgetting<lb>
orders, she rustled to the door with an expression which<lb>
fashion-plates have not yet attained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, little bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, bonny bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they looked at one another, and both smiled. But<lb>
they seemed to have changed characters, for Moor's usually<lb>
tranquil face was full of pale excitement; Sylvia's usually<lb>
vivacious one, full of quietude, and her eyes wore the unquestioning<lb>
content of a child who accepts some friendly<lb>
hand, sure that it will lead it right.</p>
<pb n="162">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prue desires me to take you out into the upper hall, and<lb>
when Mr. Deane beckons, we are to go down at once. The<lb>
rooms are full, and Jessie is ready. Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment: Geoffrey, are you quite happy now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supremely happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it shall be the first duty of my life to keep you<lb>
so,&rdquo; and with a gesture soft yet solemn, Sylvia laid her<lb>
hand in his, as if endowing him with both gift and giver.<lb>
He held it fast and never let it go until it was his own.</p>
<p>In the upper hall they found Mark hovering about Jessie<lb>
like an agitated bee, about a very full-blown flower, and<lb>
Clara Deane flapping him away, lest he should damage the<lb>
effect of this beautiful white rose. For ten minutes, ages<lb>
they seemed, the five stood together listening to the stir below,<lb>
looking at one another, till they were tired of the sight<lb>
and scent of orange blossoms, and wishing that the whole<lb>
affair was safely over. But the instant a portentous &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo;<lb>
was heard, and a white glove seen to beckon from the stair<lb>
foot, every one fell into a flutter. Moor turned paler still,<lb>
and Sylvia felt his heart beat hard against her hand. She,<lb>
herself was seized with a momentary desire to run away and<lb>
say &ldquo;No&rdquo; again; Mark looked as if nerving himself for<lb>
immediate execution, and Jessie feebly whispered &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Clara, I'm going to faint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, what shall I do with her? Mark support<lb>
her! My darling girl, smell this and bear up. For<lb>
mercy sake do something, Sylvia, and don't stand there<lb>
looking as if you'd been married every day for a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his excitement, Mark gave his bride a little shake. Its<lb>
effect was marvellous. She rallied instantly, with a reproachful<lb>
glance at her crumpled veil and a decided &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick, I can go now.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="163">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-168">

<figdesc>Page 163.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Down they went, through a wilderness of summer silks,<lb>
black coats, and bridal gloves. How they reached their<lb>
places none of them ever knew; Mark said afterward, that<lb>
the instinct of self preservation, led him to the only means<lb>
of extrication that circumstances allowed. The moment<lb>
the Bishop opened his book, Prue took out her handkerchief<lb>
and cried steadily through the entire ceremony, for<lb>
dear as were the proprieties, the &ldquo;children&rdquo; were dearer<lb>
still.</p>
<p>At Sylvia's desire, Mark was married first, and as she stood<lb>
listening to the sonorous roll of the service falling from the<lb>
Bishop's lips, she tried to feel devout and solemn, but failed<lb>
to do so. She tried to keep her thoughts from wandering,<lb>
but continually found herself wondering if that sob<lb>
came from Prue, if her father felt it very much, and when<lb>
it would be done. She tried to keep her eyes fixed timidly<lb>
upon the carpet as she had been told to do, but they would<lb>
rise and glance about against her will.</p>
<p>One of these derelictions from the path of duty, nearly<lb>
produced a catastrophe. Little Tilly, the gardener's pretty<lb>
child, had strayed in from among the servants peeping at a<lb>
long window in the rear, and established herself near the<lb>
wedding group, looking like a small ballet girl in her full<lb>
white frock and wreath pushed rakishly askew on her curly<lb>
pate. As she stood regarding the scene with dignified<lb>
amazement, her eye met Sylvia's. In spite of the unusual<lb>
costume, the baby knew her playmate, and running to her,<lb>
thrust her head under the veil with a delighted &ldquo;Peep<lb>
a bo!&rdquo; Horror seized Jessie, Mark was on the brink of a<lb>
laugh, and Moor looked like one fallen from the clouds.<lb>
But Sylvia drew the little marplot close to her with a warning<lb>
word, and there she stayed, quietly amusing herself<lb>
<pb n="164">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-169">

<figdesc>Page 164.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with &ldquo;pooring&rdquo; the silvery dress, smelling the flowers and<lb>
staring at the Bishop.</p>
<p>After this, all prospered. The gloves came smoothly off,<lb>
the rings went smoothly on; no one cried but Prue, no one<lb>
laughed but Tilly; the brides were admired, the grooms<lb>
envied; the service pronounced impressive, and when it<lb>
ended, a tumult of congratulations arose.</p>
<p>Sylvia always had a very confused idea of what happened<lb>
during the next hour. She remembered being kissed till<lb>
her cheeks burned, and shaken hands with till her fingers<lb>
tingled; bowing in answer to toasts, and forgetting to reply<lb>
when addressed by the new name; trying to eat and drink,<lb>
and discovering that everything tasted of wedding cake;<lb>
finding herself up stairs hurrying on her travelling dress,<lb>
then down stairs saying good by; and when her father<lb>
embraced her last of all, suddenly realizing with a pang,<lb>
that she was married and going away, never to be little<lb>
Sylvia any more.</p>
<p>Prue <hi rend="italics">was</hi> gratified to her heart's content, for, when the<lb>
two bridal carriages had vanished with handkerchiefs flying<lb>
from their windows, in answer to the white whirlwind<lb>
on the lawn, Mrs. Grundy, with an approving smile on<lb>
her aristocratic countenance, pronounced this the most<lb>
charming affair of the season.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> began with a pleasant journey. Day after day they<lb>
loitered along country roads that led them through many<lb>
scenes of summer beauty; pausing at old-fashioned inns<lb>
and wayside farmhouses, or gipsying at noon in some green<lb>
nook where their four-footed comrades dined off their tablecloth<lb>
while they made merry over the less simple fare their<lb>
last hostess had provided for them. When the scenery was<lb>
uninteresting, as was sometimes the case, for Nature will<lb>
not disturb her domestic arrangements for any bridal pair,<lb>
one or the other read aloud, or both sang, while conversation<lb>
was a never-failing pastime and silence had charms which<lb>
they could enjoy. Sometimes they walked a mile or two,<lb>
ran down a hillside, rustled through a grain field, strolled<lb>
into an orchard, or feasted from fruitful hedges by the way,<lb>
as care-free as the squirrels on the wall, or the jolly brown<lb>
bees lunching at the sign of &ldquo;The Clover-top.&rdquo; They<lb>
made friends with sheep in meadows, cows at the brook,<lb>
travellers morose or bland, farmers full of a sturdy sense<lb>
that made their chat as wholesome as the mould they delved<lb>
in; school children barefooted and blithe, and specimens of<lb>
womankind, from the buxom housewife who took them<lb>
under her motherly wing at once, to the sour, snuffy,<lb>

shoebinding spinster with &ldquo;No Admittance&rdquo; written all over<lb>
her face.</p>
<p>To Moor the world was glorified with the purple light<lb>
which seldom touches it but once for any of us; the journey<lb>
was a wedding march, made beautiful by summer,<lb>
victorious by joy; his young wife the queen of women, and<lb>
himself an equal of the gods because no longer conscious<lb>
of a want. Sylvia could not be otherwise than happy, for<lb>
finding unbounded liberty and love her portion, she had<lb>
nothing to regret, and regarded marriage as an agreeable<lb>
process which had simply changed her name and given her<lb>
protector, friend, and lover all in one. She was therefore her<lb>
sweetest and sincerest self, miraculously docile, and charmingly<lb>
gay; interested in all she saw, and quite overflowing<lb>
with delight when the last days of the week betrayed the<lb>
secret that her destination was the mountains.</p>
<p>Loving the sea so well, her few flights from home had<lb>
given her only marine experiences, and the flavor of entire<lb>
novelty was added to the feast her husband had provided<lb>
for her. It came to her not only when she could enjoy it<lb>
most, but when she needed it most, soothing the unquiet,<lb>
stimulating the nobler elements which ruled her life by<lb>
turns and fitting her for what lay before her. Choosing the<lb>
quietest roads, Moor showed her the wonders of a region<lb>
whose wild grandeur and beauty make its memory a life-long<lb>
satisfaction. Day after day they followed mountain<lb>
paths, studying the changes of an ever-varying landscape,<lb>
watching the flush of dawn redden the granite fronts of<lb>
these Titans scared with centuries of storm, the lustre of<lb>
noon brood over them until they smiled, the evening purple<lb>
wrap them in its splendor, or moonlight touch them with its<lb>
magic; till Sylvia, always looking up at that which filled<lb>

<figdesc>Page 167.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her heart with reverence and awe, was led to look beyond,<lb>
and through the medium of the friend beside her learned<lb>
that human love brings us nearer to the Divine, and is the<lb>
surest means to that great end.</p>
<p>The last week of the honeymoon came all too soon, for<lb>
then they had promised to return. The crowning glory of<lb>
the range was left until the last, and after a day of memorable<lb>
delights Sylvia sat in the sunset feasting her eyes upon<lb>
the wonders of a scene which is indescribable, for words<lb>
have limits and that is apparently illimitable. Presently<lb>
Moor came to her asking &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you join a party to the great ice palace, and see<lb>
three acres of snow in August, worn by a waterfall into a<lb>
cathedral, as white if not as durable as any marble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sit so comfortably here I think I had rather not.<lb>
But you must go because you like such wonders, and I<lb>
shall rest till you come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall take myself off and leave you to muse<lb>
over the pleasures of the day, which for a few hours has<lb>
made you one of the most eminent women this side the Rocky<lb>
Mountains. There is a bugle at the house here with which<lb>
to make the echoes, I shall take it with me, and from time<lb>
to time send up a sweet reminder that you are not to stray<lb>
away and lose yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia sat for half an hour, then wearied by the immensity<lb>
of the wide landscape she tried to rest her mind by<lb>
examining the beauties close at hand. Strolling down the<lb>
path the sight-seers had taken, she found herself in a rocky<lb>
basin, scooped in the mountain side like a cup for a little<lb>
pool, so clear and bright it looked a diamond set in jet. A<lb>
fringe of scanty herbage had collected about its brim,<lb>
russet mosses, purple heath, and delicate white flowers,<lb>
<pb n="168">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-173">

<figdesc>Page 168.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
like a band of tiny hill people keeping their revels by some<lb>
fairy well. The spot attracted her, and remembering that<lb>
she was not to stray away, she sat down beside the path to<lb>
wait for her husband's return.</p>
<p>In the act of bending over the pool to sprinkle the thirsty<lb>
little company about it, her hand was arrested by the<lb>
tramp of approaching feet, and looking up to discover who<lb>
was the disturber of her retreat, she saw a man pausing<lb>
at the top of the path opposite to that by which she had<lb>
come. He seemed scrutinizing the solitary occupant of the<lb>
dell before descending; but as she turned her face to him<lb>
he flung away knapsack, hat, and staff, and then with a<lb>
great start she saw no stranger, but Adam Warwick. Coming<lb>
down to her so joyfully, so impetuously, she had only<lb>
time to recognise him, and cry out, when she was swept up<lb>
in an embrace as tender as irresistible, and lay there conscious<lb>
of nothing, but that happiness like some strong swift<lb>
angel had wrapt her away into the promised land so long<lb>
believed in, hungered for, and despaired of, as forever lost.<lb>
Soon she heard his voice, breathless, eager, but so fond it<lb>
seemed another voice than his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling! did you think I should never come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had forgotten me, I knew you were married.<lb>
Adam, put me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he only held her closer, and laughed such a happy<lb>
laugh that Sylvia felt the truth before he uttered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I marry, loving you? How could I forget<lb>
you even if I had never come to tell you this? Sylvia, I<lb>
know much that has passed. Geoffrey's failure gave me<lb>
courage to hope for success, and that the mute betrothal<lb>
made with a look so long ago had been to you all it has<lb>
been to me.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="169">

<milestn unit="collation" n="15">
<p>&ldquo;Adam, you are both right and wrong, &mdash; you do not<lb>
know all, &mdash; let me tell you,&rdquo; &mdash; began Sylvia, as these<lb>
proofs of ignorance brought her to herself with a shock of<lb>
recollection and dismay. But Warwick was as absolute<lb>
in his happiness as he had been in his self-denial, and took<lb>
possession of her mentally as well as physically with a despotism<lb>
too welcome and entire to be at once resisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall tell me nothing till I have shown the cause<lb>
of my hard-seeming silence. I must throw off that burden<lb>
first, then I will listen to you until morning if you<lb>
will. I have earned this moment by a year of effort, let<lb>
me keep you here and enjoy it without alloy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old charm had lost none of its power, for absence<lb>
seemed to have gifted it with redoubled potency, the confirmation<lb>
of that early hope to grace it with redoubled warmth.<lb>
Sylvia let him keep her, feeling that he had earned that<lb>
small reward for a year's endeavor, resolving to grant all<lb>
now left her to bestow, a few moments more of blissful ignorance,<lb>
then to show him his loss and comfort him, sure<lb>
that her husband would find no disloyalty in a compassion<lb>
scarcely less deep and self-forgetful than his own would<lb>
have been had he shared their secret. Only pausing to<lb>
place himself upon the seat she had left, Warwick put off<lb>
her hat, and turning her face to his regarded it with such<lb>
unfeigned and entire content her wavering purpose was fixed<lb>
by a single look. Then as he began to tell the story of the<lb>
past she forgot everything but the rapid words she listened<lb>
to, the countenance she watched, so beautifully changed and<lb>
softened, it seemed as if she had never seen the man<lb>
before, or saw him now as we sometimes see familiar figures<lb>
glorified in dreams. In the fewest, kindest words Warwick<lb>
told her of Ottila, the promise and the parting; then, as if<lb>
<pb n="170">

<figdesc>Page 170.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the dearer theme deserved less brevity, he lingered on it as<lb>
one lingers at a friend's door, enjoying in anticipation the<lb>
welcome he is sure awaits him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night we walked together by the river &mdash; such a<lb>
wilful yet winning comrade as I had that day, and how I<lb>
enjoyed it all! &mdash; that night I suspected that Geoffrey loved<lb>
you, Sylvia, and was glad to think it. A month later I<lb>
was sure of it, and found in that knowledge the great hardship<lb>
of my life, because I loved you myself. Audacious<lb>
thing! how dared you steal into my heart and take possession<lb>
when I had turned my last guest out and barred the<lb>
door? I thought I had done with the sentiment that had<lb>
so nearly wrecked me once, but see how blind I was &mdash; the<lb>
false love only made me readier for the true. You never<lb>
seemed a child to me, Sylvia, because you have an old soul<lb>
in a young body, and your father's trials and temptations<lb>
live again in you. This first attracted me. I liked to<lb>
watch, to question, to study the human enigma to which I<lb>
had found a clue from its maker's lips. I liked your candor<lb>
and simplicity, your courage and caprice. Even your<lb>
faults found favor in my eyes; for pride, will, impetuosity<lb>
were old friends of mine, and I liked to see them working<lb>
in another shape. At first you were a curiosity, then an<lb>
amusement, then a necessity. I wanted you, not occasionally,<lb>
but constantly. You put salt and savor into life for<lb>
me; for whether you spoke or were silent, were sweet or<lb>
sour, friendly or cold, I was satisfied to feel your nearness,<lb>
and always took away an inward content which nothing<lb>
else could give me. This affection was so unlike the other<lb>
that I deceived myself for a time &mdash; not long. I soon knew<lb>
what had befallen me, soon felt that this sentiment was<lb>
good to feel, because I forgot my turbulent and worser self<lb>
<pb n="171">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-176">

<figdesc>Page 171.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and felt the nobler regenerated by the innocent companionship<lb>
you gave me. I wanted you, but it was not the touch<lb>
of hands or lips, the soft encounter of eyes, the tones of<lb>
tenderness, I wanted most. It was that something beyond<lb>
my reach, vital and vestal, invisible, yet irresistible; that<lb>
something, be it heart, soul, or mind, which drew me to<lb>
you by an attraction genial and genuine as itself. My Sylvia,<lb>
that was love, and when it came to me I took it in,<lb>
sure that whether its fruition was granted or denied I<lb>
should be a manlier man for having harbored it even for an<lb>
hour. Why turn your face away? Well, hide it if you<lb>
will, but lean here as you did once so long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let him lay it on his shoulder, still feeling that<lb>
Moor was one to look below the surface of these things and<lb>
own that she did well in giving so pure a love a happy<lb>
moment before its death, as she would have cherished<lb>
Warwick had he laid dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that September evening, as I sat alone, I had been<lb>
thinking of what might be and what must be. Had decided<lb>
that I would go away for Geoffrey's sake. He was<lb>
fitter than I to have you, being so gentle, and in all ways<lb>
ready to possess a wife. I was so rough, such a yagrant,<lb>
so full of my own purposes and plans, how could I dare<lb>
to take into my keeping such a tender little creature as<lb>
yourself? I thought you did not care for me; I knew<lb>
any knowledge of my love would only mar his own; so it<lb>
was best to go at once and leave him to the happiness he<lb>
so well deserved. Just then you came to me, as if the<lb>
wind had blown my desire to my arms. Such a loving<lb>
touch that was! it nearly melted my resolve, it seemed<lb>
hard not to take the one thing I wanted when it came to<lb>
me so opportunely. I yearned to break that idle promise,<lb>
<pb n="172">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-177">

<figdesc>Page 172.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
made when I was vain in my own conceit, and justly punished<lb>
for its folly; but you said keep it, and I did. You<lb>
could not understand my trouble, and when I sat before<lb>
you so still, perhaps looking grim and cold, you did not<lb>
know how I was wrestling with my unruly self. I am not<lb>
truly generous, for the relinquishment of any cherished<lb>
object always costs a battle, and I too often find I am<lb>
worsted. For the first time I dared not meet your eyes till<lb>
you dived into mine with that expression wistful and guileless,<lb>
which has often made me feel as if we stood divested<lb>
of our bodies, soul to soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tongue I could control, heart I could not. Up it<lb>
sprung stronger than will, swifter than thought, and answered<lb>
you. Sylvia, had there been one ray of self-consciousness<lb>
in those steady eyes of yours, one atom of maiden<lb>
shame, or fear, or trouble, I should have claimed you as my<lb>
own. There was not; and though you let me read your<lb>
face like an open book, you never dreamed what eloquence<lb>
was in it. Innocent heart, that loved and had not learned<lb>
to know it. I saw this instantly, saw that a few more such<lb>
encounters would show it to you likewise, and felt more<lb>
strongly than before that if ever the just deed to you, the<lb>
generous one to Geoffrey were done, it should be then. For<lb>
that was the one moment when your half-awakened heart<lb>
could fall painlessly asleep again, if I did not disturb it,<lb>
and dream on till Geoffrey woke it, to find a gentler master<lb>
than I could be to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could not, Adam; you had wholly roused it, and<lb>
it cried for you so long, so bitterly, oh, why did you not<lb>
come to answer it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I till the year was over? Was I not obeying<lb>
you in keeping that accursed promise? God knows I<lb>

have made many blunders, but I think the most senseless<lb>
was that promise; the most short-sighted, that belief.<lb>
What right had I to fetter my tongue, or try to govern<lb>
love? Shall I ever learn to do my own work aright, and<lb>
not meddle with the Lord's? Sylvia, take this presumptuous<lb>
and domineering devil out of me in time, lest I blunder<lb>
as blindly after you are mine as I have before. Now<lb>
let me finish before Mark comes to find us. I went away,<lb>
you know, singing the farewell I dared not speak, and for<lb>
nine months kept myself sane and steady with whatever<lb>
my hands found to do. If ever work of mine is blessed it<lb>
will be that, for into it I put the best endeavor of my life.<lb>
Though I had renounced you, I kept my love; let it burn<lb>
day and night, fed it with labor and with prayer, trusting<lb>
that this selfish heart of mine might be recast and made a<lb>
fitter receptacle for an enduring treasure. In May, far at<lb>
the West, I met a woman who knew Geoffrey; had seen<lb>
him lately, and learned that he had lost you. She was his<lb>
cousin, I his friend, and through our mutual interest in him<lb>
this confidence naturally came about. When she told me<lb>
this hope blazed up, and all manner of wild fancies haunted<lb>
me. Love is arrogant, and I nourished a belief that even<lb>
I might succeed where Geoffrey failed. You were so young,<lb>
you were not likely to be easily won by any other, if such<lb>
a man had asked in vain, and a conviction gradually took<lb>
possession of me that you <hi rend="italics">had</hi> understood, <hi rend="italics">had</hi> loved, and<lb>
were yet waiting for me. A month seemed an eternity to<lb>
wait, but I left myself no moment for despair, and soon<lb>
turned my face to Cuba, finding renewed hope on the way.<lb>
Gabriel went with me, told me how Ottila had searched for<lb>
me, and failing to find me had gone back to make ready<lb>
for my coming. How she had tried to be all I desired, and<lb>
<pb n="174">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-179">

<figdesc>Page 174.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
how unworthy I was of her. This was well, but the mention<lb>
of your name was better, and much close questioning<lb>
gave me the scene which he remembered, because Ottila had<lb>
chidden him sharply for his disclosures to yourself. Knowing<lb>
you so well, I gathered much from trifles which were<lb>
nothing in Gabriel's eyes. I felt that regard for me, if<lb>
nothing warmer, had prompted your interest in them; and<lb>
out of the facts given me by Faith and Gabriel I built<lb>
myself a home, which I have inhabited as a guest till now,<lb>
when I know myself its master, and welcome its dear mistress,<lb>
so my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent to give her tender greeting, but Sylvia arrested<lb>
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Adam! not yet! Go on, before it is too late<lb>
to tell me as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought it was some maidenly scruple, and though<lb>
he smiled at it he respected it, for this same coyness in the<lb>
midst of all her whims had always been one of her attractions<lb>
in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shy thing! I will tame you yet, and draw you to me<lb>
as confidingly as I drew the bird to hop into my hand and<lb>
eat. You must not fear me, Sylvia, else I shall grow tyrannical;<lb>
for I hate fear, and like to trample on whatever dares<lb>
not fill its place bravely, sure that it will receive its due as<lb>
trustfully as these little mosses sit among the clouds and<lb>
find a spring to feed them even in the rock. Now I will<lb>
make a speedy end of this, pleasant as it is to sit here feeling<lb>
myself no longer a solitary waif. I shall spare you the<lb>
stormy scenes I passed through with Ottila, because I do<lb>
not care to think of my Cleopatra while I hold &ldquo;my fine<lb>
spirit Ariel&rdquo; in my arms. She had done her best, but had<lb>
I been still heart-free I never could have married her. She<lb>

<figdesc>Page 175.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
is one of those tameless natures which only God can govern;<lb>
I dared not, even when I thought I loved her, for much as I<lb>
love power I love truth more. I told her this, heard<lb>
prayers, reproaches, threats, and denunciations; tried to<lb>
leave her kindly, and then was ready for my fate with you.<lb>
But I was not to have my will so easily. I had fallen into<lb>
the net, and was not to leave it till the scourging had been<lb>
given. So like that other wandering Christian, I cried out,<lb>
submitted, and was the meeker for it. I had to wait a little<lb>
before the ship sailed; I would not stay at El Labarinto,<lb>
Gabriel's home, for Ottila was there; and though the fever<lb>
raged at Havana, I felt secure in my hitherto unbroken<lb>
health. I returned there, and paid the penalty; for weeks<lb>
of suffering taught me that I could not trifle with this body<lb>
of mine, sturdy as it seemed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Adam, who took care of you? Where did you lie<lb>
and suffer all that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fret yourself concerning that; I was not neglected.<lb>
A sister of the `Sacred Heart' took excellent<lb>
care of me, and a hospital is as good as a palace when one<lb>
neither knows nor cares where he is. It went hardly with<lb>
<pb n="176">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-181">

<figdesc>Page 176.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
prepared for me as if sure I was to fill the place I had left,<lb>
hoping that this confidence of hers would have its due<lb>
effect upon me. It did try me sorely, but an experience<lb>
once over is as if it had never been, as far as regret or indecision<lb>
is concerned; therefore wedding gowns and imperious<lb>
women failed to move me. To be left a groomless<lb>
bride stung that fiery pride of hers more than many an<lb>
actual shame or sin would have done. People would pity<lb>
her, would see her loss, deride her wilful folly. Gabriel<lb>
loved her as she desired to be loved, blindly and passionately;<lb>
few knew of our later bond, many of our betrothal,<lb>
why not let the world believe me the rejected party come<lb>
back for a last appeal? I had avoided all whom I once<lb>
knew, for I loathed the place; no one had discovered me at<lb>
the hospital, she thought me gone, she boldly took the step,<lb>
married the poor boy, left Cuba before I was myself again,<lb>
and won herself an empty victory which I never shall disturb.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange! Yet I can believe it of her, she looked<lb>
a woman who would dare do anything. Then you came<lb>
back Adam, to find me? What led you here, hoping so<lb>
much and knowing so little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know me do anything in the accustomed<lb>
way? Do I not always aim straight at the thing I want<lb>
and pursue it by the shortest road? It fails often, and I<lb>
go back to the slower surer way; but my own is always<lb>
tried first, as involuntarily as I hurled myself down that<lb>
slope, as if storming a fort instead of meeting my sweetheart.<lb>
That is a pretty old word beloved of better men<lb>
than I, so let me use it once. Among the first persons I<lb>
met on landing was a friend of your father's; he was just<lb>
driving away in hot haste, but catching a glimpse of the<lb>
<pb n="177">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-182">

<figdesc>Page 177.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
familiar face, I bethought me that it was the season for<lb>
summer travel, you might be away, and no one else would<lb>
satisfy me; he might know, and time be saved. I asked one<lb>
question, &ldquo;Where are the Yules?&rdquo; He answered, as he<lb>
vanished, &ldquo;The young people are all at the mountains.&rdquo;<lb>
That was enough, and congratulating myself on the forethought<lb>
which would save me some hundred miles of needless<lb>
delay, away I went, and for days have been searching<lb>
for you every where on that side of these hills which I know<lb>
so well. But no Yules h d passed, and feeling sure you<lb>
were on this side I came, not around, but straight over, for<lb>
this seemed a royal road to my love, and here I found her<lb>
waiting for me by the way. Now Sylvia, are your doubts<lb>
all answered, your fears all laid, your heart at rest on mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the time drew nearer Sylvia's task daunted her.<lb>
Warwick was so confident, so glad and tender over her, it<lb>
seemed like pronouncing the death doom to say those hard<lb>
words, &ldquo;It is too late.&rdquo; While she struggled to find some<lb>
expression that should tell all kindly yet entirely, Adam,<lb>
seeming to read some hint of her trouble, asked, with that<lb>
gentleness which now overlaid his former abruptness, and<lb>
was the more alluring for the contrast &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I been too arrogant a lover? too sure of happiness,<lb>
too blind to my small deserts? Sylvia, have I misunderstood<lb>
the greeting you have given me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Adam, utterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knit his brows, his eye grew anxious, his content<lb>
seemed rudely broken, but still hopefully he said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that absence has changed you, that you do<lb>
not love me as you did, and pity made you kind? Well,<lb>
I receive the disappointment, but I do not relinquish my<lb>
desire. What has been may be; let me try again to earn<lb>
<pb n="178">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-183">

<figdesc>Page 178.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
you; teach me to be humble, patient, all that I should be<lb>
to make myself more dear to you. Something disturbs you,<lb>
be frank with me; I have shown you all my heart, what<lb>
have you to show me in return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She freed herself entirely from his hold and held up her<lb>
hand before him. He did not see the ring; he thought she<lb>
gave him all he asked, and with a glow of gratitude extended<lb>
both his own to take it. Then she saw that delay was worse<lb>
than weak, and though she trembled she spoke out bravely<lb>
ending his suspense at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam, I do <hi rend="italics">not</hi> love you as I did, nor can I wish or try<lb>
to bring it back, because &mdash; I am married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprung up as if shot through the heart, nor could a<lb>
veritable bullet from her hand have daunted him with a<lb>
more intense dismay than those three words. An instant's<lb>
incredulity, then conviction came to him, and he met it like<lb>
a man, for though his face whitened and his eye burned<lb>
with an expression that wrung her heart, he demanded<lb>
steadily. &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the hardest question of all, for well she knew<lb>
the name would wound the deeper for its dearness, and<lb>
while it lingered pitifully upon her lips its owner answered<lb>
for himself. Clear and sweet came up the music of the<lb>
horn, bringing them a familiar air they all loved, and<lb>
had often sung together. Warwick knew it instantly, felt<lb>
the hard truth but rebelled against it, and put out his arm<lb>
as if to ward it off as he exclaimed, with real anguish in<lb>
countenance and voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sylvia! it is not Geoffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Then, as if all strength had gone out of her, she dropped<lb>
down upon the mossy margin of the spring and covered up<lb>
her face, feeling that the first sharpness of a pain like this<lb>
was not for human eyes to witness. How many minutes<lb>
passed she could not tell, the stillness of the spot remained<lb>
unbroken by any sound but the whisper of the wind, and<lb>
in this silence Sylvia found time to marvel at the calmness<lb>
which came to her. Self had been forgotten in surprise<lb>
and sympathy, and still her one thought was how to comfort<lb>
Warwick. She had expected some outburst of feeling,<lb>
some gust of anger or despair, but neither sigh nor sob,<lb>
reproach nor regret reached her, and soon she stole an<lb>
anxious glance to see how it went with him. He was standing<lb>
where she left him, both hands locked together till they<lb>
were white with the passionate pressure. His eyes fixed on<lb>
some distant object with a regard as imploring as unseeing,<lb>
and through those windows of the soul he looked out darkly,<lb>
not despairingly; but as if sure that somewhere there was<lb>
help for him, and he waited for it with a stern patience<lb>
more terrible to watch than the most tempestuous grief.<lb>
Sylvia could not bear it, and remembering that her confession<lb>
had not yet been made, seized that instant for the<lb>
purpose, prompted by an instinct which assured her that the<lb>
knowledge of her pain would help him to bear his own.</p>
<p>She told him all, and ended saying &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Adam, come to me and let me try to comfort<lb>
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia was right; for through the sorrowful bewilderment<lb>
that brought a brief eclipse of hope and courage, sympathy<lb>
reached him like a friendly hand to uphold him till he<lb>
found the light again. While speaking, she had seen the<lb>
immobility that frightened her break up, and Warwick's<lb>
<pb n="180">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-185">

<figdesc>Page 180.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
whole face flush and quiver with the rush of emotions<lb>
controllable no longer. But the demonstration which followed<lb>
was one she had never thought to see from him, for<lb>
when she stretched her hands to him with that tender invitation,<lb>
she saw the deep eyes fill and overflow. Then he<lb>
threw himself down before her, and for the first time in her<lb>
short life showed her that sad type of human suffering, a<lb>
man weeping like a woman.</p>
<p>Warwick was one of those whose passions, as his virtues,<lb>
were in unison with the powerful body they inhabited, and<lb>
in such a crisis as the present but one of two reliefs were<lb>
possible to him; either wrathful denunciation, expostulation<lb>
and despair, or the abandon of a child. Against the former<lb>
he had been struggling dumbly till Sylvia's words had<lb>
turned the tide, and too entirely natural to feel a touch of<lb>
shame at that which is not a weakness but a strength,<lb>
too wise to reject so safe an outlet for so dangerous a grief,<lb>
he yielded to it, letting the merciful magic of tears quench<lb>
the fire, wash the first bitterness away, and leave reproaches<lb>
only writ in water. It was better so, and Sylvia acknowledged<lb>
it within herself as she sat mute and motionless,<lb>
softly touching the brown hair scattered on the moss, her<lb>
poor consolation silenced by the pathos of the sight, while<lb>
through it all rose and fell the fitful echo of the horn, in<lb>
very truth &ldquo;a sweet reminder not to stray away and lose<lb>
herself.&rdquo; An hour ago it would have been a welcome sound,<lb>
for peak after peak gave back the strain, and airy voices<lb>
whispered it until the faintest murmur died. But now she<lb>
let it soar and sigh half heard, for audible to her alone still<lb>
came its sad accompaniment of bitter human tears. To<lb>
Warwick it was far more; for music, the comforter, laid her<lb>
balm on his sore heart as no mortal pity could have done,<lb>

and wrought the miracle which changed the friend who<lb>
seemed to have robbed him of his love to an unconscious<lb>
Orpheus, who subdued the savage and harmonized the man.<lb>
Soon he was himself again, for to those who harbor the<lb>
strong virtues with patient zeal, no lasting ill can come,<lb>
no affliction can wholly crush, no temptation wholly vanquish.<lb>
He rose with eyes the clearer for their stormy rain,<lb>
twice a man for having dared to be a child again. Humbler<lb>
and happier for the knowledge that neither vain resentment<lb>
nor unjust accusation had defrauded of its dignity, the<lb>
heavy hour that left him desolate but not degraded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> comforted, Sylvia, rest assured of that. And<lb>
now there is little more to say, but one thing to do. I<lb>
shall not see your husband yet, and leave you to tell him<lb>
what seems best, for, with the instinct of an animal, I<lb>
always go away to outlive my hurts alone. But remember<lb>
that I acquit you of blame, and believe that I will yet be<lb>
happy in your happiness. I know if Geoffrey were here, he<lb>
would lot me do this, because he has suffered as I suffer<lb>
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending, he gathered her to an embrace as different from<lb>
that other as despair is from delight, and while he held her<lb>
there, crowding into one short minute, all the pain and passion<lb>
of a year, she heard a low, but exceeding bitter<lb>
cry &mdash; &ldquo;Oh, my Sylvia! it is hard to give you up.&rdquo;<lb>
Then, with a solemn satisfaction, which assured her as it<lb>
did himself, he spoke out clear and loud &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for the merciful Hereafter, in which we<lb>
may retrieve the blunders we make here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he left her, never turning till the burden so<lb>
joyfully cast down had been resumed. Then, staff and hat<lb>
in hand, he paused on the margin of that granite cup, to<lb>

him a cup of sorrow, and looked into its depths again.<lb>
Clouds were trooping eastward, but in that pause the sun<lb>
glanced full on Warwick's figure, lifting his powerful<lb>
head into a flood of light, as he waved his hand to Sylvia<lb>
with a gesture of courage and good cheer. The look, the<lb>
act, the memories they brought her, made her heart ache<lb>
with a sharper pang than pity, and filled her eyes with tears<lb>
of impotent regret, as she turned her head as if to chide<lb>
the blithe clamor of the horn. When she looked again, the<lb>
figure and the sunshine were both gone, leaving her alone<lb>
and in the shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">No</hi> cousin Faith to-night. The rain has prevented her<lb>
from taking this boat, and she is not likely to come later as<lb>
she comes alone,&rdquo; said Moor, returning from a fruitless<lb>
drive to meet his expected guest one October evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It always rains when I want anything very much. I<lb>
seem to have a great deal of bad weather in my life,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Sylvia, despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the rain; let us make sunshine for ourselves,<lb>
and forget it as children do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I was a child again, they are always happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us play at being children, then. Let us sit down<lb>
upon the rug, parch corn, crack nuts, roast apples, and be<lb>
merry in spite of wind or weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia's face brightened, for the fancy pleased her, and<lb>
she wanted something new and pleasant to divert her<lb>
thoughts from herself. Glancing at her dress, which was<lb>
unusually matronly in honor of the occasion, she said smiling&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't look much like a child, but I should like to try<lb>
and feel like one again if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us both look and feel so as much as possible. You<lb>
like masquerading; go make a little girl of yourself, while I<lb>
turn boy, and prepare for our merry making.</p>

</p>
<p>No lad could have spoken with a blither face, for Moor<lb>
had preserved much of the boy in spite of his thirty years.<lb>
His cheerfulness was so infectious, that Sylvia already began<lb>
to forget her gloom, and hurried away to do her part.<lb>
Putting on a short, girlish gown, kept for scrambles among<lb>
the rocks, she improvised a pinafore, and braided her long<lb>
hair a la Morlena Kenwigs, with butterfly bows at the ends.<lb>
When she went down, she found her husband in garden<lb>
jacket, collar turned over a ribbon, hair in a curly tumble,<lb>
and jackknife in hand, seated on the rug before a roaring<lb>
fire, and a semicircle of apples, whittling and whistling<lb>
like a very boy. They examined one another with mirthful<lb>
commendations, and Moor began his part by saying &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is n't this jolly? Now come and cuddle down here<lb>
beside me, and see which will keep it up the longest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would Prue say? and who would recognize the<lb>
elegant Mr. Moor in this big boy? Putting dignity and<lb>
broadcloth aside makes you look about eighteen, and very<lb>
charming I find you,&rdquo; said Sylvia, looking about twelve<lb>
herself, and also very charming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a wooden fork for you to tend the roast with,<lb>
while I see to the corn laws and prepare a vegetable snowstorm.<lb>
What will you have, little girl, you look as if you<lb>
wanted something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only thinking that I should have a doll to match<lb>
your knife. I feel as if I should enjoy trotting a staring<lb>
fright on my knee, and singing Hush-a-by. But I fancy<lb>
even your magic cannot produce such a thing, &mdash; can it, my<lb>
lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In exactly five minutes a lovely doll will appear,<lb>
though such a thing has not been seen in my bachelor establishment<lb>
for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which mysterious announcement Moor ran off, blundering<lb>
over the ottomans and slamming the doors as a true<lb>
boy should. Sylvia pricked chestnuts, and began to forget<lb>
her bosom trouble as she wondered what would appear with<lb>
the impatient curiosity appropriate to the character she had<lb>
assumed. Presently her husband reappeared with much<lb>
breeziness of aspect, rain drops in his hair, and a squirming<lb>
bundle in his arms. Triumphantly unfolding many<lb>
wraps, he displayed little Tilly in her night-gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is sorcery for you, and a doll worth having; being<lb>
one of the sort that can shut its eyes; it was going to bed,<lb>
but its mamma relented and lends it to us for the night.<lb>
I told Mrs. Dodd you wanted her, and could n't wait, so she<lb>
sent her clothes; but the room is so warm let the dear play<lb>
in her pretty bed-gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia received her lovely plaything with enthusiasm,<lb>
and Tilly felt herself suddenly transported to a baby's Paradise,<lb>
where beds were unknown and fruit and freedom were<lb>
her welcome portion. Merrily popped the corn, nimbly<lb>
danced the nuts upon the shovel, lustily remonstrated the<lb>
rosy martyrs on the hearth, and cheerfully the minutes<lb>
slipped away. Sylvia sung every jubilant air she knew,<lb>
Moor whistled astonishing accompaniments, and Tilly danced<lb>
over the carpet with nut-shells on her toes, and tried to fill<lb>
her little gown with &ldquo;pitty flowers&rdquo; from its garlands and<lb>
bouquets. Without the wind lamented, the sky wept, and<lb>
the sea thundered on the shore; but within, youth, innocence,<lb>
and love held their blithe revel undisturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are the spirits now?&rdquo; asked one playmate of the<lb>
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite merry, thank you; and I should think I was<lb>
little Sylvia again but for the sight of this.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>She held up the hand that wore a single ornament; but<lb>
the hand had grown so slender since it was first put on, that<lb>
the ring would have fallen had she not caught it at her<lb>
finger-tip. There was nothing of the boy in her companion's<lb>
face, as he said, with an anxious look &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go on thinning so fast I shall begin to fear that<lb>
the little wife is not happy with her old husband. Is she,<lb>
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would be a most ungrateful woman if she were not.<lb>
I always get thin as winter comes on, but I'm so careless<lb>
I'll find a guard for my ring to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to wait till then; wear this to please me, and<lb>
let Marion's cipher signify that you are <hi rend="italics">mine.</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a gravity that touched her more than the bestowal<lb>
of so dear a relic, Moor unslung a signet ring from his<lb>
watchguard, and with some difficulty pressed it to its<lb>
place on Sylvia's finger, a most effectual keeper for that<lb>
other ring whose tenure seemed so slight. She shrunk a<lb>
little and glanced up at him, because his touch was more<lb>
firm than tender, and his face wore a masterful expression<lb>
seldom seen there; for instinct, subtler than perception,<lb>
prompted both act and aspect. Then her eye fell and fixed<lb>
upon the dark stone with the single letter engraved upon<lb>
its tiny oval, and to her it took a double significance as her<lb>
husband held it there, claiming her again, with that emphatic<lb>
&ldquo;Mine.&rdquo; She did not speak, but something in her<lb>
manner caused the fold between his brows to smooth itself<lb>
away as he regarded the small hand lying passively in his,<lb>
and said, half playfully, half earnestly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I hurt you, but you know my wooing is<lb>
not over yet; and till you love me with a perfect love I cannot<lb>
feel that my wife is wholly mine.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so young, you know; when I am a woman grown<lb>
I can give you a woman's love; now it is a girl's, you say.<lb>
Wait for me, Geoffrey, a little longer, for indeed I do my<lb>
best to be all you would have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something brought tears into her eyes and made her lips<lb>
tremble, but in a breath the smile came back, and she added<lb>
gayly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help being grave sometimes, and getting<lb>
thin, with so many housekeeping cares upon my shoulders,<lb>
and such an exacting, tyrannical husband to wear upon my<lb>
nerves. Don't I look like the most miserable of wives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not certainly as she shook the popper laughingly,<lb>
and looked over her shoulder at him, with the bloom of fire-light<lb>
on her cheeks, its cheerfulness in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep that expression for every day wear, and I am<lb>
satisfied. I want no tame Griselda, but the little girl who<lb>
once said she was always happy with me. Assure me of<lb>
that, and, having won my Leah, I can work and wait still<lb>
longer for my Rachel. Bless the baby! what has she done<lb>
to herself now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tilly had retired behind the sofa, after she had swarmed<lb>
over every chair and couch, examined everything within her<lb>
reach, on <hi rend="italics">&eacute;tag&egrave;re</hi> and table, embraced the Hebe in the corner,<lb>
played a fantasia on the piano, and choked herself with<lb>
the stopper of the odor bottle. A doleful wail betrayed<lb>
her hiding-place, and she now emerged with a pair of nutcrackers,<lb>
ditto of pinched fingers, and an expression of<lb>
great mental and bodily distress. Her woes vanished instantaneously,<lb>
however, when the feast was announced, and<lb>
she performed an unsteady <hi rend="italics">pas seul</hi> about the banquet,<lb>
varied by skirmishes with her long night-gown and darts at<lb>
any unguarded viand that tempted her.</p>

</p>
<p>No ordinary table service would suit the holders of this<lb>
fireside <hi rend="italics">f&ecirc;te.</hi> The corn was heaped in a bronze urn, the<lb>
nuts in a graceful basket, the apples lay on a plate of curiously<lb>
ancient china, and the water turned to wine through<lb>
the medium of a purple flagon of Bohemian glass. The<lb>
refection was spread upon the rug as on a flowery table, and<lb>
all the lustres were lighted, filling the room with a festal<lb>
glow. Prue would have held up her hands in dismay, like<lb>
the benighted piece of excellence she was, but Mark would<lb>
have enjoyed the picturesque group and sketched a mate to<lb>
the Golden Wedding. For Moor, armed with the wooden<lb>
fork, did the honors; Sylvia, leaning on her arm, dropped<lb>
corn after corn into a baby mouth that bird-like always<lb>
gaped for more; and Tilly lay luxuriously between them,<lb>
warming her little feet as she ate and babbled to the flames.</p>
<p>The clock was on the stroke of eight, the revel at its<lb>
height, when the door opened and a servant announced &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dane and Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An impressive pause followed, broken by a crow from<lb>
Tilly, who seized this propitious moment to bury one hand<lb>
in the nuts and with the other capture the big red apple<lb>
which had been denied her. The sound seemed to dissipate<lb>
the blank surprise that had fallen on all parties, and<lb>
brought both host and hostess to their feet, the former exclaiming,<lb>
heartily &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, friends, to a modern saturnalia and the bosom<lb>
of the Happy Family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you did not expect me so late,&rdquo; said Miss Dane.<lb>
&ldquo;I was detained at the time fixed upon and gave it up, but<lb>
Mr. Warwick came, and we set off together. Pray don't<lb>
disturb yourselves, but let us enjoy the game with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Adam are guests who never come too early or<lb>

<figdesc>Page 189.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
too late. We are playing children to-night, so just put<lb>
yourselves back a dozen years and let us all be merry together.<lb>
Sylvia, this our cousin, Faith here is your new<lb>
kinswoman. Please love one another as little people are<lb>
commanded to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short stir ensued while hands were shaken, wraps put<lb>
off, and some degree of order restored to the room, then<lb>
they all sat down and began to talk. With well bred oblivion<lb>
of the short gown and long braids of her bashful-looking<lb>
hostess, Miss Dane suggested and discussed various<lb>
subjects of mutual interest, while Sylvia tried to keep her<lb>
eyes from wandering to the mirror opposite, which reflected<lb>
the figures of her husband and his friend.</p>
<p>Warwick sat erect in the easy-chair, for he never lounged;<lb>
and Moor, still supporting his character, was perched upon<lb>
the arm, talking with boyish vivacity. Every sense being<lb>
unwontedly alert, Sylvia found herself listening to both<lb>
guests at once, and bearing her own part in one conversation<lb>
so well that occasional lapses were only attributed to<lb>
natural embarrassment. What she and Miss Dane said she<lb>
never remembered; what the other pair talked of she never<lb>
forgot. The first words she caught were her husband's.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I have begun to live for myself, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also see that it agrees with you excellently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than with you, for you are not looking like your<lb>
old self, though June made you happy, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If freedom is happiness it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More so than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia lost the next words, for a look showed her Moor's<lb>
hand on Adam's shoulder, and that for the first time within<lb>
her memory Warwick did not meet his friend's glance with<lb>
<pb n="190">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-195">

<figdesc>Page 190.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
one as open, but bent his eyes upon the ground, while his<lb>
hand went to and fro across his lips as if to steady them.<lb>
It was a gesture she remembered well, for though self-control<lb>
could keep the eye clear, the voice firm, that half-hidden<lb>
mouth of his sometimes rebelled and grew tremulous as a<lb>
woman's. The sight and the answer set her heart beating<lb>
with the thought, &ldquo;Why has he come?&rdquo; The repetition<lb>
of a question by Miss Dane recalled her from a dangerous<lb>
memory, and when that friendly lady entered upon another<lb>
long sentence to relieve her young hostess, she heard Moor<lb>
say &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had too much solitude, Adam; I am sure of<lb>
it, for no man can live long alone and not get the uncanny<lb>
look you have. What have you been at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fighting the old fight with this unruly self of mine,<lb>
and getting ready for another tussle with the Adversary, in<lb>
whatever shape he may appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you are come to your friend for the social<lb>
solace which the haughtiest heart hungers for when most<lb>
alone. You shall have it. Stay with us, Adam, and remember<lb>
that whatever changes come to me my home is<lb>
always yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Geoffrey. I wanted to see your happiness<lb>
before I go away again, and should like to stay with<lb>
you a day or so if you are sure that &mdash; that she would<lb>
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moor laughed and pulled a lock of the brown mane, as<lb>
if to tease the lion into a display of the spirit he seemed<lb>
to have lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shy you are of speaking the new name! `She'<lb>
will like it, I assure you, for she makes my friends hers.<lb>
Sylvia, come here, and tell Adam he is welcome; he dares<lb>
<pb n="191">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-196">

<figdesc>Page 191.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to doubt it. Come and talk over old times, while I do the<lb>
same with Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went, trembling inwardly, but outwardly composed,<lb>
for she took refuge in one of those commonplace acts which<lb>
in such moments we gladly perform, and bless in our secret<lb>
souls. She had often wondered where they would next<lb>
meet, and how she should comport herself at such a trying<lb>
time. She had never imagined that he would come in this<lb>
way, or that a hearth-brush would save her from the<lb>
betrayal of emotion. So it was, however, and an involuntary<lb>
smile passed over her face as she managed to say<lb>
quite naturally, while brushing the nutshells tidily out of<lb>
sight &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you are always welcome, Mr. Warwick.<lb>
`Adam's Room,' as we call it, is always ready, and<lb>
Geoffrey was wishing for you only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of his satisfaction at my coming, can I be<lb>
equally sure of yours. May I, ought I to stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward as he spoke, with an eager yet submissive<lb>
look, that Sylvia dared not meet, and in her anxiety<lb>
to preserve her self-possession, she forgot that to this listener<lb>
every uttered word became a truth, because his own were<lb>
always so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, if you can bear our quiet life, for we are<lb>
a Darby and Joan already, though we do not look so to-night,<lb>
I acknowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men seldom understand the subterfuges women instinctively<lb>
use to conceal many a natural emotion which they are<lb>
not strong enough to control, not brave enough to confess.<lb>
To Warwick, Sylvia seemed almost careless, her words a<lb>
frivolous answer to the real meaning of his question, her<lb>
smile one of tranquil welcome. Her manner wrought an<lb>
<pb n="192">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-197">

<figdesc>Page 192.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
instant change in him, and when he spoke again he was the<lb>
Warwick of a year ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hesitated, Mrs. Moor, because I have sometimes heard<lb>
young wives complain that their husbands' friends were<lb>
marplots, and I have no desire to be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech, delivered with frosty gravity, made Sylvia<lb>
as cool and quiet as itself. She put her ally down, looked<lb>
full at Warwick, and said with a blending of dignity and<lb>
cordiality which even the pinafore could not destroy &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please to consider yourself a specially invited guest,<lb>
now and always. Never hesitate, but come and go as freely<lb>
as you used to do, for nothing need be changed between us<lb>
three because two of us have one home to offer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks; and now that the hearth is scrupulously clean<lb>
may I offer you a chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old keenness was in his eye, the old firmness about<lb>
the mouth, the old satirical smile on his lips as Warwick<lb>
presented the seat, with an inclination that to her seemed<lb>
ironical. She sat down, but when she cast about her mind<lb>
for some safe and easy topic to introduce, every idea had<lb>
fled; even memory and fancy turned traitors; not a lively<lb>
sally could be found, not a pleasant remembrance returned<lb>
to help her, and she sat dumb. Before the dreadful pause<lb>
grew awkward, however, rescue came in the form of Tilly.<lb>
Nothing daunted by the severe simplicity of her attire she<lb>
planted herself before Warwick, and shaking her hair out<lb>
of her eyes stared at him with an inquiring glance and<lb>
cheeks as red as her apple. She seemed satisfied in a<lb>
moment, and climbing to his knee established herself there,<lb>
coolly taking possession of his watch, and examining the<lb>
brown beard curiously as it parted with the white flash of<lb>
teeth, when Warwick smiled his warmest smile.</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="17">
<p>&ldquo;This recalls the night you fed the sparrow in your<lb>
hand. Do you remember, Adam?&rdquo; and Sylvia looked and<lb>
spoke like her old self again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seldom forget anything. But pleasant as that hour<lb>
was this is more to me, for the bird flew away, the baby<lb>
stays and gives me what I need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrapt the child closer in his arms, leaned his dark<lb>
head on the bright one, and took the little feet into his<lb>
hand with a fatherly look that caused Tilly to pat his<lb>
cheek and begin an animated recital of some nursery<lb>
legend, which ended in a sudden gape, reminding Sylvia<lb>
that one of her guests was keeping late hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What comes next?&rdquo; asked Warwick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I lay me and byelow in the trib,&rdquo; answered Tilly,<lb>
stretching herself over his arm with a great yawn.</p>
<p>Warwick kissed the rosy half-open mouth and seemed<lb>
loth to part with the pious baby, for he took the shawl<lb>
Sylvia brought and did up the drowsy bundle himself.<lb>
While so busied she stole a furtive glance at him, having<lb>
looked without seeing before. Thinner and browner, but<lb>
stronger than ever was the familiar face she saw, yet<lb>
neither sad nor stern, for the grave gentleness which had<lb>
been a fugitive expression before now seemed habitual.<lb>
This, with the hand at the lips and the slow dropping of<lb>
the eyes, were the only tokens of the sharp experience he<lb>
had been passing through. Born for conflict and endurance,<lb>
he seemed to have manfully accepted the sweet uses<lb>
of adversity and grown the richer for his loss.</p>
<p>Those who themselves are quick to suffer, are also quick<lb>
to see the marks of suffering in others; that hasty scrutiny<lb>
assured Sylvia of all she had yearned to know, yet wrung<lb>
her heart with a pity the deeper for its impotence. Tilly's<lb>

heavy head drooped between her bearer and the light as<lb>
they left the room, but in the dusky hall a few hot tears<lb>
fell on the baby's hair, and her new nurse lingered long<lb>
after the lullaby was done. When she reappeared the<lb>
girlish dress was gone, and she was Madam Moor again, as<lb>
her husband called her when she assumed her stately air.<lb>
All smiled at the change, but he alone spoke of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I win the applause, Sylvia; for I sustain my character<lb>
to the end, while you give up before the curtain falls. You<lb>
are not so good an actress as I thought you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia's smile was sadder than her tears as she briefly<lb>
answered &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I find I cannot be a child again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> of Sylvia's first acts when she rose was most significant.<lb>
She shook down her abundant hair, carefully<lb>
arranged a part in thick curls over cheeks and forehead,<lb>
gathered the rest into its usual coil, and said to herself, as<lb>
she surveyed her face half hidden in the shining cloud &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks very sentimental, and I hate the weakness that<lb>
drives me to it, but it must be done, because my face is such<lb>
a traitor. Poor Geoffrey! he said I was no actress; I am<lb>
learning fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why every faculty seemed sharpened, every object assumed<lb>
an unwonted interest, and that quiet hour possessed<lb>
an excitement that made her own room and countenance<lb>
look strange to her, she would not ask herself, as she paused<lb>
on the threshold of the door to ascertain if her guests were<lb>
stirring. Nothing was heard but the sound of regular footfalls<lb>
on the walk before the door, and with an expression of<lb>
relief she slowly went down. Moor was taking his morning<lb>
walk bareheaded in the sun. Usually Sylvia ran to join<lb>
him, but now she stood musing on the steps, until he saw<lb>
and came to her. As he offered the flower always ready<lb>
for her, he said smiling &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the play last night so captivate you, that you go<lb>
back to the curls, because you cannot keep the braids?&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sillier whim than that, even. I am afraid of those<lb>
two people; and as I am so quick to show my feelings in<lb>
my face, I intend to hide behind this veil if I get shy or<lb>
troubled. Did you think I could be so artful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your craft amazes me. But, dearest child, you need<lb>
not be afraid of Faith and Adam. Both already love you<lb>
for my sake, and soon will for your own. Both are so much<lb>
older, that they can easily overlook any little short-coming,<lb>
in consideration of your youth. Sylvia, I want to tell you<lb>
something about Adam. I never spoke of it before, because,<lb>
although no promise of silence was asked or given,<lb>
I knew he considered it a confidence. Now that it is all<lb>
over, I know that I may tell my wife, and she will help me<lb>
comfort him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell on, Geoffrey, I hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, when we went gypsying long ago, on the<lb>
night you and Adam lost the boat, as I sat drying your<lb>
boots, and privately adoring them in spite of the mud, I<lb>
made a discovery. Adam loved, was on some sort of probation,<lb>
and would be married in June. He was slow to speak<lb>
of it, but I understood, and last night when I went to his<lb>
room with him, I asked how he had fared. Sylvia, it would<lb>
have made your heart ache to have seen his face, as he said<lb>
in that brief way of his &mdash; &ldquo;Geoffrey, the woman I loved is<lb>
married, ask me nothing more.&rdquo; I never shall; but I know,<lb>
by the change I see in him, that the love was very dear, the<lb>
wound very deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Adam! how can we help him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him do as he likes. I will take him to his old<lb>
haunts, and busy him with my affairs till he forgets his<lb>
own. In the evenings we will have Prue, Mark, and Jessie<lb>
over here, will surround him with social influences, and<lb>

make the last hours of the day the cheerfullest; then he<lb>
wont lie awake and think all night, as I suspect he has been<lb>
doing of late. Sylvia, I should like to see that woman;<lb>
though I could find it in my heart to hate her for her perfidy<lb>
to such a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia's head was bent as if to inhale the sweetness of<lb>
the flower she held, and all her husband saw was the bright<lb>
hair blowing in the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pity her for her loss as well as hate her. Now, let<lb>
us talk of something else, or my tell-tale face will betray<lb>
that we have been talking of him, when we meet Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did so, and when Warwick put up his curtain, the<lb>
first sight he saw, was his friend walking with his young<lb>
wife under the red-leaved maples, in the sunshine. The<lb>
look Moor had spoken of, came into his eyes, darkening<lb>
them with the shadow of despair. A moment it gloomed<lb>
there, then passed, for Honor said reproachfully to Love &mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;They are happy, should not that content you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall!&rdquo; answered the master of both, as he dropped<lb>
the curtain and turned away.</p>
<p>In pursuance of his kindly plan, Moor took Adam out<lb>
for a long tramp soon after breakfast, and Sylvia and Miss<lb>
Dane sat down to sew. In the absence of the greater fear,<lb>
Sylvia soon forgot the lesser one, and began to feel at ease,<lb>
to study her new relative and covet her esteem.</p>
<p>Faith was past thirty, shapely and tall, with much natural<lb>
dignity of carriage, and a face never beautiful, but always<lb>
singularly attractive from its mild and earnest<lb>
character. Looking at her, one felt assured that here was<lb>
a right womanly woman, gentle, just, and true; possessed of<lb>
a well-balanced mind, a self-reliant soul, and that fine gift<lb>
which is so rare, the power of acting as a touchstone to all<lb>
<pb n="198">

<figdesc>Page 198.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
who approached, forcing them to rise or fall to their true<lb>
level, unconscious of the test applied. Her presence was<lb>
comfortable, her voice had motherly tones in it, her eyes a<lb>
helpful look. Even the soft hue of her dress, the brown<lb>
gloss of her hair, the graceful industry of her hands, had<lb>
their attractive influence. Sylvia saw and felt these things<lb>
with the quickness of her susceptible temperament, and<lb>
found herself so warmed and won, that soon it cost her an<lb>
effort to withhold anything that tried or troubled her, for<lb>
Faith was a born consoler, and Sylvia's heart was full.</p>
<p>However gloomy her day might have been she always<lb>
brightened in the evening as naturally as moths begin to<lb>
flutter when candles come. On the evening of this day the<lb>
friendly atmosphere about her, and the excitement of Warwick's<lb>
presence so affected her, that though the gayety of<lb>
girlhood was quite gone she looked as softly brilliant as<lb>
some late flower that has gathered the summer to itself<lb>
and gives it out again in the bloom and beauty of a single<lb>
hour.</p>
<p>When tea was over, for heroes and heroines must eat if<lb>
they are to do anything worth the paper on which their<lb>
triumphs and tribulations are recorded, the women gathered<lb>
about the library table, work in hand, as female tongues go<lb>
easier when their fingers are occupied. Sylvia left Prue<lb>
and Jessie to enjoy Faith, and while she fabricated some<lb>
trifle with scarlet silk and an ivory shuttle, she listened to<lb>
the conversation of the gentlemen who roved about the room<lb>
till a remark of Prue's brought the party together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen Chesterfield has run away from her husband in<lb>
the most disgraceful manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark and Moor drew near, Adam leaned on the chimneypiece,<lb>
the workers paused, and having produced her<lb>
<pb n="199">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-204">

<figdesc>Page 199.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sensation, Prue proceeded to gratify their curiosity as briefly as<lb>
possible, for all knew the parties in question and all waited<lb>
anxiously to hear particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She married a Frenchman old enough to be her father,<lb>
but very rich. She thought she loved him, but when she<lb>
got tired of her fine establishment, and the novelties of<lb>
Paris, she found she did not, and was miserable. Many of<lb>
her new friends had lovers, so why should not she; and<lb>
presently she began to amuse herself with this Louis<lb>
Gustave Isadore Theodule de Roueville &mdash; There's a name<lb>
for a Christian man! Well, she began in play, grew in<lb>
earnest, and when she could bear her domestic trouble no<lb>
longer she just ran away, ruining herself for this life, and<lb>
really I don't know but for the next also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul! I always thought she was a fool, but upon<lb>
my word I pity her,&rdquo; said Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember she was very young, so far away from her<lb>
mother, with no real friend to warn and help her, and love<lb>
is so sweet. No wonder she went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, how can you excuse her in that way? She<lb>
should have done her duty whether she loved the old<lb>
gentleman or not, and kept her troubles to herself in a<lb>
proper manner. You young girls think so much of love, so<lb>
little of moral obligations, decorum, and the opinions of the<lb>
world, you are not fit judges of the case. Mr. Warwick<lb>
agrees with me, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that Helen should have left her<lb>
husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if she could not love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you also mean to say that she did right to run off<lb>
with that Gustave Isadore Theodule creature?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="200">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-205">

<figdesc>Page 200.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means. It is worse than folly to attempt the<lb>
righting of one wrong by the commission of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what in the world should she have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should have honestly decided which she loved, have<lb>
frankly told the husband the mistake both had made, and<lb>
demanded her liberty. If the lover was worthy, have<lb>
openly married him and borne the world's censures. If<lb>
not worthy, have stood alone, an honest woman in God's<lb>
eyes, whatever the blind world might have thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue was scandalized to the last degree, for with her<lb>
marriage was more a law than a gospel; a law which ordained<lb>
that a pair once yoked should abide by their bargain,<lb>
be it good or ill, and preserve the proprieties in public no<lb>
matter how hot a hell their home might be for them and<lb>
for their children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful state society would be in if your ideas<lb>
were adopted! People would constantly be finding out<lb>
that they were mismatched, and go running about as if<lb>
playing that game where every one changes places. I'd<lb>
rather die at once than live to see such a state of things as<lb>
that,&rdquo; said the worthy spinster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I, and recommend prevention rather than a<lb>
dangerous cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really should like to hear your views, Mr. Warwick,<lb>
for you quite take my breath away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much to Sylvia's surprise Adam appeared to like the<lb>
subject, and placed his views at Prue's disposal with<lb>
alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would begin at the beginning, and teach young people<lb>
that marriage is not the only aim and end of life, yet would<lb>
fit them for it, as for a sacrament too high and holy to be<lb>
profaned by a light word or thought. Show them how to<lb>
<pb n="201">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-206">

<figdesc>Page 201.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
be worthy of it and how to wait for it. Give them a law of<lb>
life both cheerful and sustaining; a law that shall keep them<lb>
hopeful if single, sure that here or hereafter they will find<lb>
that other self and be accepted by it; happy if wedded, for<lb>
their own integrity of heart will teach them to know the<lb>
true god when he comes, and keep them loyal to the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all very excellent and charming, but what are<lb>
the poor souls to do who have n't been educated in this<lb>
fine way?&rdquo; asked Prue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy marriages are the tragedies of our day, and<lb>
will be, till we learn that there are truer laws to be obeyed<lb>
than those custom sanctions, other obstacles than inequalities<lb>
of fortune, rank, and age. Because two persons love,<lb>
it is not always safe or wise for them to marry, nor need<lb>
it necessarily wreck their peace to live apart. Often what<lb>
seems the best affection of our hearts does more for us by<lb>
being thwarted than if granted its fulfilment and prove a<lb>
failure which embitters two lives instead of sweetening one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused there, but Prue wanted a clearer answer, and<lb>
turned to Faith, sure that the woman would take her own<lb>
view of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of us is right, Miss Dane, in Helen's case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot venture to judge the young lady, knowing so<lb>
little of her character or the influences that have surrounded<lb>
her, and believing that a certain divine example is best<lb>
for us to follow at such times. I agree with Mr. Warwick,<lb>
but not wholly, for his summary mode of adjustment would<lb>
not be quite just nor right in all cases. If both find that<lb>
they do not love, the sooner they part the wiser; if one<lb>
alone makes the discovery the case is sadder still, and<lb>
harder for either to decide. But as I speak from observation<lb>
only my opinions are of little worth.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="202">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-207">

<figdesc>Page 202.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of great worth, Miss Dane; for to women like yourself<lb>
observation often does the work of experience, and despite<lb>
your modesty I wait to hear the opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick spoke, and spoke urgently, for the effect of all<lb>
this upon Sylvia was too absorbing a study to be relinquished<lb>
yet. As he turned to her, Faith gave him an<lb>
intelligent glance, and answered like one speaking with<lb>
intention and to some secret but serious issue &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have them. Let us suppose that Helen was<lb>
a woman possessed of a stronger character, a deeper nature;<lb>
the husband a younger, nobler man; the lover truly<lb>
excellent, and above even counselling the step this pair have<lb>
taken. In a case like that the wife, having promised to<lb>
guard another's happiness, should sincerely endeavor to do<lb>
so, remembering that in making the joy of others we often<lb>
find our own, and that having made so great a mistake the<lb>
other should not bear all the loss. If there be a strong<lb>
attachment on the husband's part, and he a man worthy of<lb>
affection and respect, who has given himself confidingly,<lb>
believing himself beloved by the woman he so loves, she<lb>
should leave no effort unmade, no self-denial unexacted,<lb>
till she has proved beyond all doubt that it is impossible to<lb>
be a true wife. Then, and not till then, has she the right<lb>
to dissolve the tie that has become a sin, because where no<lb>
love lives inevitable suffering and sorrow enter in, falling<lb>
not only upon guilty parents, but the innocent children<lb>
who may be given them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lover, what of him?&rdquo; asked Adam, still intent<lb>
upon his purpose, for, though he looked steadily at<lb>
Faith, he knew that Sylvia drove the shuttle in and out<lb>
with a desperate industry that made her silence significant<lb>
to him.</p>
<pb n="203">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-208">

<figdesc>Page 203.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have the lover suffer and wait; sure that, however<lb>
it may fare with him, he will be the richer and the<lb>
better for having known the joy and pain of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; And to Mark's surprise Warwick bowed<lb>
gravely, and Miss Dane resumed her work with a preoccupied<lb>
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for a confirmed celibate, it strikes me you take a<lb>
remarkable interest in matrimony,&rdquo; said Mark. &ldquo;Or is it<lb>
merely a base desire to speculate upon the tribulations of<lb>
your fellow-beings, and congratulate yourself upon your<lb>
escape from them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither; I not only pity and long to alleviate them,<lb>
but have a strong desire to share them, and the wish<lb>
and purpose of my life for the last year has been to<lb>
marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outspoken as Warwick was at all times and on all subjects,<lb>
there was something in this avowal that touched<lb>
those present, for with the words a quick rising light and<lb>
warmth illuminated his whole countenance, and the energy<lb>
of his desire tuned his voice to a key which caused one<lb>
heart to beat fast, one pair of eyes to fill with sudden tears.<lb>
Moor could not see his friend's face, but he saw Mark's,<lb>
divined the indiscreet inquiry hovering on his lips, and<lb>
arrested it with a warning gesture.</p>
<p>A pause ensued, during which each person made some<lb>
mental comment on the last speech, and to several of the<lb>
group that little moment was a memorable one. Remembering<lb>
the lost love Warwick had confessed to him, Moor<lb>
thought with friendliest regret &mdash; &ldquo;Poor Adam, he finds it<lb>
impossible to forget.&rdquo; Reading the truth in the keen delight<lb>
the instant brought her, Sylvia cried out within herself,<lb>
&ldquo;Oh, Geoffrey, forgive me, for I love him!&rdquo; and<lb>
<pb n="204">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-209">

<figdesc>Page 204.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Warwick whispered to that impetuous heart of his, &ldquo;Be<lb>
still, we have ventured far enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue spoke first, very much disturbed by having her<lb>
prejudices and opinions opposed, and very anxious to prove<lb>
herself in the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark and Geoffrey look as if they agreed with Mr.<lb>
Warwick in his &mdash; excuse me if I say, dangerous ideas; but<lb>
I fancy the personal application of them would change their<lb>
minds. Now, Mark, just look at it; suppose some one of<lb>
Jessie's lovers should discover an affinity for her, and she<lb>
for him, what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him or myself, or all three, and make a neat<lb>
little tragedy of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no getting a serious answer from you, and I<lb>
wonder I ever try. Geoffrey, I put the case to you; if<lb>
Sylvia should find she adored Julian Haize, who fell sick<lb>
when she was married, you know, and should inform you<lb>
of that agreeable fact some fine day, should you think it<lb>
quite reasonable and right to say, &ldquo;Go, my dear, I'm very<lb>
sorry, but it can't be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way in which Prue put the case made it impossible<lb>
for her hearers not to laugh. But Sylvia held her breath<lb>
while waiting for her husband's answer. He was standing<lb>
behind her chair, and spoke with the smile still on his lips,<lb>
too confident to harbor even a passing fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought to be generous enough to do so, but<lb>
not being a Jaques, with a convenient glacier to help me<lb>
out of the predicament, I am afraid I should be hard to<lb>
manage. I love but few, and those few are my world; so<lb>
do not try me too hardly, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do my best, Geoffrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped her shuttle as she spoke, and stooping to<lb>

pick it up, down swept the long curls over either cheek;<lb>
thus, when she fell to work again, nothing of her face was<lb>
visible but a glimpse of forehead, black lashes and faintly<lb>
smiling mouth. Moor led the conversation to other topics,<lb>
and was soon deep in an art discussion with Mark and Miss<lb>
Dane, while Prue and Jessie chatted away on that safe subject,<lb>
dress. But Sylvia worked silently, and Warwick still<lb>
leaned there watching the busy hand as if he saw something<lb>
more than a pretty contrast between the white fingers<lb>
and the scarlet silk.</p>
<p>When the other guests had left, and Faith and himself<lb>
had gone to their rooms, Warwick, bent on not passing another<lb>
sleepless night full of unprofitable longings, went<lb>
down again to get a book. The library was still lighted,<lb>
and standing there alone he saw Sylvia, wearing an expression<lb>
that startled him. Both hands pushed back and held<lb>
her hair away as if she scorned concealment from herself.<lb>
Her eyes seemed fixed with a despairing glance on some invisible<lb>
disturber of her peace. All the light and color<lb>
that made her beautiful were gone, leaving her face worn<lb>
and old, and the language of both countenance and attitude<lb>
was that of one suddenly confronted with some hard fact,<lb>
some heavy duty, that must be accepted and performed.</p>
<p>This revelation lasted but a moment, Moor's step came<lb>
down the hall, the hair fell, the anguish passed, and nothing<lb>
but a wan and weary face remained. But Warwick<lb>
had seen it, and as he stole away unperceived he pressed<lb>
his hands together, saying mournfully within himself, &ldquo;I<lb>
was mistaken. God help us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi> Sylvia needed another trial to make that hard week<lb>
harder, it soon came to her in the knowledge that Warwick<lb>
watched her. She well knew why, and vainly endeavored<lb>
to conceal from him that which she had succeeded in concealing<lb>
entirely from others. But he possessed the key to<lb>
her variable moods; he alone knew that now painful forethought,<lb>
not caprice dictated many of her seeming whims,<lb>
and ruled her simplest action. To others she appeared busy,<lb>
gay, and full of interest in all about her; to him, the industry<lb>
was a preventive of forbidden thoughts; the gayety a<lb>
daily endeavor to forget; the interest, an anxiety concerning<lb>
the looks and words of her companions, because she must<lb>
guard her own.</p>
<p>Sylvia felt something like terror in the presence of this<lb>
penetrating eye, this daring will, for the vigilance was unflagging<lb>
and unobtrusive, and with all her efforts she could<lb>
not read his heart as she felt her own was being read.<lb>
Adam could act no part, but bent on learning the truth<lb>
for the sake of all, he surmounted the dangers of the situation<lb>
by no artifice, no rash indulgence, but by simply shunning<lb>
solitary interviews with Sylvia as carefully as the<lb>
courtesy due his hostess would allow. In walks and drives,<lb>
and general conversation, he bore his part, surprising and<lb>

</eaffig>
delighting those who knew him best by the genial change<lb>
which seemed to have softened his rugged nature. But the<lb>
instant the family group fell apart and Moor's devotion to<lb>
his cousin left Sylvia alone, Warwick was away into the<lb>
wood or out upon the sea, lingering there till some meal,<lb>
some appointed pleasure, or the evening lamp brought all<lb>
together. Sylvia understood this, and loved him for it even<lb>
while she longed to have it otherwise. But Moor reproached<lb>
him for his desertion, doubly felt since the gentler acquirements<lb>
made him dearer to his friend. Hating all<lb>
disguises, Warwick found it hard to withhold the fact<lb>
which was not his own to give, and sparing no blame to<lb>
himself, answered Moor's playful complaint with a sad<lb>
sincerity that freed him from all further pleadings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geoffrey, I have a heavy heart which even you cannot<lb>
heal. Leave it to time, and let me come and go as of old,<lb>
enjoying the social hour when I may, flying to solitude<lb>
when I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much as Sylvia had longed to see these friends, she<lb>
counted the hours of their stay, for the presence of one was<lb>
a daily disquieting, because spirits would often flag, conversation<lb>
fail, and an utter weariness creep over her when<lb>
she could least account for or yield to it. More than once<lb>
during that week she longed to lay her head on Faith's<lb>
kind bosom and ask help. Deep as was her husband's love<lb>
it did not possess the soothing power of a woman's sympathy,<lb>
and though it cradled her as tenderly as if she had<lb>
been a child, Faith's compassion would have been like<lb>
motherly arms to fold and foster. But friendly as they<lb>
soon became, frank as was Faith's regard for Sylvia, earnest<lb>
as was Sylvia's affection for Faith, she never seemed<lb>
to reach that deeper place where she desired to be. Always<lb>
<pb n="208">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-213">

<figdesc>Page 208.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
when she thought she had found the innermost that each of<lb>
us seek for in our friend, she felt that Faith drew back,<lb>
and a reserve as delicate as inflexible barred her approach<lb>
with chilly gentleness. This seemed so foreign to Faith's<lb>
nature that Sylvia pondered and grieved over it till the<lb>
belief came to her that this woman, so truly excellent and<lb>
loveworthy, did not desire to receive her confidence, and<lb>
sometimes a bitter fear assailed her that Warwick was not<lb>
the only reader of her secret trouble.</p>
<p>All things have an end, and the last day came none too<lb>
soon for one dweller under that hospitable roof. Faith<lb>
refused all entreaties to stay, and looked somewhat anxiously<lb>
at Warwick as Moor turned from herself to him with the<lb>
same urgency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam, you will stay? Promise me another week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never promise, Geoffrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believing that, as no denial came, his request was granted,<lb>
Moor gave his whole attention to Faith, who was to leave<lb>
them in an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, while I help our cousin to select and fasten up<lb>
the books and prints she likes to take with her, will you<lb>
run down into the garden and fill your prettiest basket with<lb>
our finest grapes? You will like that better than fumbling<lb>
with folds and string; and you know one's servants should<lb>
not perform these pleasant services for one's best friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glad to be away, Sylvia ran through the long grape<lb>
walk to its sunniest nook, and standing outside the arch,<lb>
began to lay the purple clusters in her basket. Only a<lb>
moment was she there alone; Warwick's shadow, lengthened<lb>
by the declining sun, soon fell black along the path. He<lb>
did not see her, nor seem intent on following her; he walked<lb>
slowly, hat in hand, so slowly that he was but midway down<lb>
<pb n="209">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-214">

<figdesc>Page 209.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="18 *">
the leafy lane when Faith's voice arrested him. She was<lb>
in haste, as her hurried step and almost breathless words<lb>
betrayed; and losing not an instant, she cried before they<lb>
met &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam, you will come with me? I cannot leave you<lb>
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt me, Faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but loving women are so weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So strong, you mean; men are weakest when they<lb>
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam, <hi rend="italics">will</hi> you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will follow you; I shall speak with Geoffrey first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you tell him so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith's hand had been on Warwick's arm; as he spoke<lb>
the last words she bent her head upon it for an instant,<lb>
then without another word turned and hurried back as<lb>
rapidly as she had come, while Warwick stood where she left<lb>
him, motionless as if buried in some absorbing thought.</p>
<p>All had passed in a moment, a moment too short, too full<lb>
of intense surprise to leave Sylvia time for recollection and<lb>
betrayal of her presence. Half hidden and wholly unobserved<lb>
she had seen the unwonted agitation of Faith's<lb>
countenance and manner, had heard Warwick's softly spoken<lb>
answers to those eager appeals, and with a great pang had<lb>
discovered that some tender confidence existed between these<lb>
two of which she had never dreamed. Sudden as the discovery<lb>
was its acceptance and belief; for, knowing her own<lb>
weakness, Sylvia found something like relief in the hope<lb>
that a new happiness for Warwick had ended all temptation,<lb>
and in time perhaps all pain for herself. Impulsive as ever<lb>
she leaned upon the seeming truth, and making of the fancy<lb>
<pb n="210">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-215">

<figdesc>Page 210.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
a fact, passed into a perfect passion of self-abnegation,<lb>
thinking, in the brief pause that followed Faith's departure&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the change we see in him; this made him watch<lb>
me, hoping I had forgotten, as I once said and believed. I<lb>
should be glad, I will be glad, and let him see that even<lb>
while I suffer I can rejoice in that which helps us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full of her generous purpose, yet half doubtful how to<lb>
execute it, Sylvia stepped from the recess where she had<lb>
stood, and slowly passed toward Warwick, apparently intent<lb>
on settling her fruity burden as she went. At the<lb>
first sound of her light step on the gravel he turned, feeling<lb>
at once that she must have heard, and eager to learn what<lb>
significance that short dialogue possessed for her. Only a<lb>
hasty glance did she give him as she came, but it showed<lb>
him flushed cheeks, excited eyes, and lips a little tremulous<lb>
as they said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are for Faith; will you hold the basket while I<lb>
cover it with leaves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took it, and as the first green covering was deftly<lb>
laid, he asked, below his breath &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, did you hear us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his unutterable amazement she looked up clearly, and<lb>
all her heart was in her voice, as she answered with a fervency<lb>
he could not doubt &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I was glad to hear, to know that a nobles<lb>
woman filled the place I cannot fill. Oh, believe it, Adam;<lb>
and be sure that the knowledge of your great content will<lb>
lighten the terrible regret which you have seen as nothing<lb>
else ever could have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down fell the basket at their feet, and taking her face<lb>
between his hands, Warwick bent and searched with a glance<lb>
<pb n="211">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-216">

<figdesc>Page 211.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
that seemed to penetrate to her heart's core. For a moment<lb>
she struggled to escape, but the grasp that held her was<lb>
immovable. She tried to oppose a steadfast front and baffle<lb>
that perilous inspection, but quick and deep rushed the<lb>
traitorous color over cheek and forehead with its mute betrayal.<lb>
She tried to turn her eyes away, but those other eyes,<lb>
dark and dilated with intensity of purpose, fixed her own,<lb>
and the confronting countenance wore an expression which<lb>
made its familiar features look awfully large and grand to<lb>
her panic-stricken sight. A sense of utter helplessness fell<lb>
on her, courage deserted her, pride changed to fear, defiance<lb>
to despair; as the flush faded, the fugitive glance was arrested<lb>
and the upturned face became a pale blank, ready to receive<lb>
the answer that strong scrutiny was slowly bringing to the<lb>
light, as invisible characters start out upon a page when fire<lb>
passes over them. Neither spoke, but soon through all opposing<lb>
barriers the magnetism of an indomitable will drew<lb>
forth the truth, set free the captive passion pent so long,<lb>
and wrung from those reluctant lineaments a full confession<lb>
of that power which heaven has gifted with eternal youth.</p>
<p>The instant this assurance was his own beyond a doubt,<lb>
Warwick released her, snatched up his hat, and hurrying<lb>
down the path vanished in the wood. Spent as with an<lb>
hour's excitement, and bewildered by emotions which she<lb>
could no longer master, Sylvia lingered in the grape walk<lb>
till her husband called her. Then hastily refilling her<lb>
basket, she shook her hair about her face and went to bid<lb>
Faith good by. Moor was to accompany her to the city,<lb>
and they left early, that Faith might pause for adieux to<lb>
Mark and Prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Adam? Has he gone before, or been inveigled<lb>
into staying?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="212">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-217">

<figdesc>Page 212.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Moor spoke to Sylvia, but busied in fastening the basketlid,<lb>
she seemed not to hear, and Faith replied for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will take a later boat, we need not wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Faith embraced Sylvia, all the coldness had melted<lb>
from her manner, and her voice was tender as a mother's as<lb>
she whispered low in her ear &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, if ever you need any help that Geoffrey<lb>
cannot give, remember cousin Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For two hours Sylvia sat alone, not idle, for in the first<lb>
real solitude she had enjoyed for seven days she looked<lb>
deeply into herself, and putting by all disguises owned the<lb>
truth, and resolved to repair the past if possible, as Faith<lb>
had counselled in the case which she had now made her<lb>
own. Like so many of us, Sylvia often saw her errors too<lb>
late to avoid committing them, and failing to do the right<lb>
thing at the right moment, kept herself forever in arrears<lb>
with that creditor who must inevitably be satisfied. She<lb>
had been coming to this decision all that weary week, and<lb>
these quiet hours left her both resolute and resigned.</p>
<p>As she sat there while the early twilight began to gather,<lb>
her eye often turned to Warwick's travelling bag, which<lb>
Faith, having espied it ready in his chamber, had brought<lb>
down and laid in the library, as a reminder of her wish.<lb>
As she looked at it, Sylvia 's heart yearned toward it in the<lb>
fond, foolish way which women have of endowing the possessions<lb>
of those they love with the attractions of sentient<lb>
things, and a portion of their owner's character or claim<lb>
upon themselves. It was like Warwick, simple and strong,<lb>
no key, and every mark of the long use which had tested<lb>
its capabilities and proved them durable. A pair of gloves<lb>
lay beside it on the chair, and though she longed to touch<lb>
anything of his, she resisted the temptation till, pausing<lb>
<pb n="213">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-218">

<figdesc>Page 213.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
near them in one of her journeys to the window, she saw a<lb>
rent in the glove that lay uppermost, &mdash; that appeal was<lb>
irresistible, &mdash; &ldquo;Poor Adam! there has been no one to care<lb>
for him so long, and Faith does not yet know how; surely<lb>
I may perform so small a service for him if he never knows<lb>
how tenderly I do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing ready to drop her work at a sound, Sylvia<lb>
snatched a brief satisfaction which solaced her more than<lb>
an hour of idle lamentation, and as she kissed the glove<lb>
with a long, sad kiss, and put it down with eyes that dimly<lb>
saw where it should be, perhaps there went as much real<lb>
love and sorrow into that little act as ever glorified some<lb>
greater deed. Then she went to lie in the &ldquo;Refuge,&rdquo; as<lb>
she had named an ancient chair, with her head on its embracing<lb>
arm. Not weeping, but quietly watching the flicker<lb>
of the fire, which filled the room with warm duskiness,<lb>
making the twilight doubly pleasant, till a sudden blaze<lb>
leaped up, showing her that her watch was over and Warwick<lb>
come. She had not heard him enter, but there he was<lb>
close before her, his face glowing with the frosty air, his<lb>
eye clear and kind, and in his aspect that nameless charm<lb>
which won for him the confidence of whosoever read his countenance.<lb>
Scarce knowing why, Sylvia felt reassured that<lb>
all was well, and looked up with more welcome in her heart<lb>
than she dared betray in words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come at last! where have you been so long, Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round the Island I suspect, for I lost my way, and had<lb>
no guide but instinct to lead me home again. I like to say<lb>
that word, for though it is not home it seems so to me now.<lb>
May I sit here before I go, and warm myself at your fire,<lb>
Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure of his answer he established himself on the stool at<lb>
<pb n="214">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-219">

<figdesc>Page 214.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her feet, stretched his hands to the grateful blaze, and went<lb>
on with some inward resolution lending its power and depth<lb>
to his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a question to settle with myself and went to find<lb>
my best counsellors in the wood. Often when I am harassed<lb>
by some perplexity or doubt to which I can find no<lb>
wise or welcome answer, I walk myself into a belief that it<lb>
will come; then it appears. I stoop to break a handsome<lb>
flower, to pick up a cone, or watch some little creature happier<lb>
than I, and there lies my answer, like a good luck<lb>
penny, ready to my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith has gone, but Geoffrey hopes to keep you for<lb>
another week,&rdquo; said Sylvia, ignoring the unsafe topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall he have his wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith expects you to follow her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think I ought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does the next boat leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll wait for it here. Did I wake you coming in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not asleep; only lazy, warm, and quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And deadly tired; &mdash; dear soul, how can it be otherwise,<lb>
leading the life you lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such compassion in his voice, such affection in<lb>
his eye, such fostering kindliness in the touch of the hand<lb>
he laid upon her own, that Sylvia cried within herself, &mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;Oh, if Geoffrey would only come!&rdquo; and hoping for that<lb>
help to save her from herself, she hastily replied &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Adam, &mdash; my life is easier than I<lb>
deserve, &mdash; my husband makes me very &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miserable, &mdash; the truth to me, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick rose as he spoke, closed the door and came back<lb>
<pb n="215">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-220">

<figdesc>Page 215.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
wearing an expression which caused her to start up with a<lb>
gesture of entreaty &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No no, I will not hear you! Adam, you must not<lb>
speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused opposite her, leaving a little space between<lb>
them, which he did not cross through all that followed, and<lb>
with that look, inflexible yet pitiful, he answered steadily &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> speak and you <hi rend="italics">will</hi> hear me. But understand<lb>
me, Sylvia. I desire and design no French sentiment nor sin<lb>
like that we heard of, and what I say now I would say if<lb>
Geoffrey stood between us. I have settled this point after<lb>
long thought and the heartiest prayers I ever prayed; and<lb>
much as I have at stake, I speak more for your sake than<lb>
my own. Therefore do not entreat nor delay, but listen and<lb>
let me show you the wrong you are doing yourself, your<lb>
husband, and your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Faith know all the past? does she desire you to do<lb>
this that her happiness may be secure?&rdquo; demanded Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith is no more to me, nor I to Faith, than the friendliest<lb>
regard can make us. She suspected that I loved you<lb>
long ago; she now believes that you love me; she pities<lb>
her cousin tenderly, but will not meddle with the tangle we<lb>
have made of our three lives. Forget that folly, and let<lb>
me speak to you as I should. When we parted I thought<lb>
that you loved Geoffrey; so did you. When I came here<lb>
I was sure of it for a day; but on that second night I saw<lb>
your face as you stood here alone, and then I knew what I<lb>
have since assured myself of. God knows, I think my gain<lb>
dearly purchased by his loss. I see your double trial; I<lb>
know the tribulations in store for all of us; yet, as an<lb>
honest man, I must speak out, because you ought not to<lb>
delude yourself or Geoffrey another day.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="216">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right have you to come between us and decide<lb>
my duty, Adam?&rdquo; Sylvia spoke passionately, roused to<lb>
resistance by his manner and the turmoil of emotions warring<lb>
within her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right of a sane man to save the woman he loves<lb>
from destroying her own peace forever, and undermining<lb>
the confidence of the friend dearest to them both, I know<lb>
this is not the world's way in such matters; but I care not;<lb>
because I believe one human creature has a right to speak<lb>
to another in times like these as if they two stood alone.<lb>
I will not command, I will appeal to you, and if you are<lb>
the candid soul I think you, your own words shall prove<lb>
the truth of what I say. Sylvia, do you love your husband?&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Adam, dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I did! I wish I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you happy with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was till you came; I shall be when you are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! It is impossible to go back to the blind tranquillity<lb>
you once enjoyed. Now a single duty lies before<lb>
you; delay is weak, deceit is wicked; utter sincerity<lb>
alone can help us. Tell Geoffrey all; then, whether you<lb>
live your life alone, or one day come to me, there is no<lb>
false dealing to repent of, and looking the hard fact in<lb>
the face robs it of one half its terrors. Will you do this,<lb>
Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Adam. Remember what he said that night: `I<lb>
love but few, and those few are my world,' &mdash; I am chief in<lb>
that world; shall I destroy it, for my selfish pleasure? He<lb>
waited for me very long, is waiting still; can I for a second<lb>
time disappoint the patient heart that would find it easier<lb>
<pb n="217">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-222">

<figdesc>Page 217.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="19">
to give up life than the poor possession which I am. No,<lb>
I ought not, dare not do it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dare not speak the truth to your friend, you do<lb>
not deserve him, and the name is a lie. You ask me to remember<lb>
what he said that night, &mdash; I ask you to recall the<lb>
look with which he begged you not to try him too hardly.<lb>
Put it to yourself, &mdash; which is the kinder justice, a full confession<lb>
now, or a late one hereafter, when longer subterfuge<lb>
has made it harder for you to offer, bitterer for him to receive?<lb>
I tell you, Sylvia, it were more merciful to murder<lb>
him outright than to slowly wear away his faith, his peace,<lb>
and love by a vain endeavor to perform as a duty what<lb>
should be your sweetest pleasure, and what will soon become<lb>
a burden heavier than you can bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not see as I see; you cannot understand what<lb>
I am to him, nor can I tell you what he is to me. It is<lb>
not as if I could dislike or despise him for any unworthiness<lb>
of his own; nor as if he were a lover only. Then I<lb>
could do much which now is worse than impossible, for<lb>
I have married him, and it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sylvia! why could you not have waited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? because I am what I am, too easily led by circumstances,<lb>
too entirely possessed by whatever hope, belief,<lb>
or fear rules me for the hour. Give me a steadfast nature<lb>
like your own and I will be as strong. I know I am weak,<lb>
but I am not wilfully wicked; and when I ask you to be<lb>
silent, it is because I want to save him from the pain of<lb>
doubt, and try to teach myself to love him as I should. I<lb>
must have time, but I can bear much and endeavor more<lb>
persistently than you believe. If I forgot you once, can I<lb>
not again? and should I not? I am all in all to him,<lb>
while you, so strong, so self-reliant, can do without my love<lb>
<pb n="218">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-223">

<figdesc>Page 218.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
as you have done till now, and will soon outlive your sorrow<lb>
for the loss of that which might have made us happy had<lb>
I been more patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall outlive it, else I should have little faith in<lb>
myself. But I shall not forget; and if you would remain<lb>
forever what you now are to me, you will so act that nothing<lb>
may mar this memory, if it is to be no more. I doubt your<lb>
power to forget an affection which has survived so many<lb>
changes and withstood assaults such as Geoffrey must unconsciously<lb>
have made upon it. But I have no right to<lb>
condemn your beliefs, to order your actions, or force you<lb>
to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it.<lb>
You must decide, but do not again deceive yourself, and<lb>
through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better<lb>
worth preserving than husband, happiness, or friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words fell cold on Sylvia's ear, for with the inconsistency<lb>
of a woman's heart she thought he gave her up too<lb>
readily, yet honored him more truly for sacrificing both<lb>
himself and her to the principle that ruled his life and<lb>
made him what he was. His seeming resignation steadied<lb>
her, for now he waited her decision, while before he was<lb>
only bent on executing the purpose wherein he believed salvation<lb>
lay. She girded up her strength, collected her<lb>
thoughts, and tried to show him what she believed to be<lb>
her duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you how it is with me, Adam, and be patient<lb>
if I am not wise and brave like you, but far too young,<lb>
too ignorant to bear such troubles well. I am not leaning<lb>
on my own judgment now, but on Faith's, and though you<lb>
do not love her as I hoped, you feel she is one to trust. She<lb>
said the wife, in that fictitious case which was so real to us,<lb>
the wife should leave no effort unmade, no self-denial<lb>
<pb n="219">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-224">

<figdesc>Page 219.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
unexacted, till she had fairly proved that she could not be<lb>
what she had promised. Then, and then only, had she a<lb>
right to undo the tie that had bound her. I must do this<lb>
before I think of your love or my own, for on my marriage<lb>
morning I made a vow within myself that Geoffrey's happiness<lb>
should be the first duty of my life. I shall keep that<lb>
vow as sacredly as I will those I made before the world,<lb>
until I find that it is utterly beyond my power, then I will<lb>
break all together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have tried that once, and failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have never tried it as I shall now. At first, I<lb>
did not know the truth, then I was afraid to believe, and<lb>
struggled blindly to forget. Now I see clearly, I confess it,<lb>
I resolve to conquer it, and I will not yield until I have<lb>
done my best. You say you must respect me. Could you<lb>
do so if I no longer respected myself? I should not, if I<lb>
forgot all Geoffrey had borne and done for me, and could<lb>
not hear and do this thing for him. I must make the effort,<lb>
and make it silently; for he is very proud with all his gentleness,<lb>
and would reject the seeming sacrifice though he would<lb>
make one doubly hard for love of me. If I am to stay with<lb>
him, it spares him the bitterest pain he could suffer; if I am<lb>
to go, it gives him a few more months of happiness, and I<lb>
may so prepare him that the parting will be less hard.<lb>
How others would act I cannot tell, I only know that this<lb>
seems right to me; and I must fight my fight alone, even if<lb>
I die in doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so earnest, yet so humble; so weak in all but<lb>
the desire to do well; so young to be tormented with such<lb>
fateful issues, and withal so steadfast in the grateful yet<lb>
remorseful tenderness she bore her husband, that though<lb>
sorely disappointed and not one whit convinced, Warwick<lb>
<pb n="220">

</eaffig>
could only submit to this woman-hearted child, and love<lb>
her with redoubled love, both for what she was and what<lb>
she aspired to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, what would you have me do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go away, and for a long time, Adam; because<lb>
when you are near me my will is swayed by yours, and<lb>
what you desire I long to give you. Go quite away, and<lb>
through Faith you may learn whether I succeed or fail. It<lb>
is hard to say this, yet you know it is a truer hospitality<lb>
in me to send you from my door than to detain and offer<lb>
you temptation for your daily bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How strangely Ottila came back to him, and all the<lb>
scenes he had passed through with her! &mdash; a perilous contrast<lb>
just then. Yet, despite his pride in the loving little<lb>
creature who put him from her that she might be worthy of<lb>
him, one irrepressible lament swelled his heart and passed<lb>
his lips &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sylvia! I thought that parting on the mountain<lb>
was the hardest I could ever know, but this is harder; for<lb>
now I have but to say come to me, and you would come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the bitter moment had its drop of honey, whose<lb>
sweetness nourished him when all else failed. Sylvia<lb>
answered with a perfect confidence in that integrity which<lb>
even her own longing could not bribe &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Adam, but you will not say it, because feeling as<lb>
I feel, you know I must not come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did know it, and confessed his submission by folding<lb>
fast the arms half opened for her, and standing dumb with<lb>
the words trembling on his lips. It was the bravest action<lb>
of a life full of real valor, for the sacrifice was not made<lb>
with more than human fortitude. The man's heart clamored<lb>
for its right, patience was weary, hope despaired, and all<lb>

natural instincts mutinied against the command that bound<lb>
them. But no grain of virtue ever falls wasted to the<lb>
ground; it drops back upon its giver a regathered strength,<lb>
and cannot fail of its reward in some kindred soul's approval,<lb>
imitation, or delight. It was so then, as Sylvia went<lb>
to him; for though she did not touch nor smile upon him,<lb>
he felt her nearness; and the parting assured him that its<lb>
power bound them closer than the happiest union. In her<lb>
face there shone a look half fervent, half devout, and her<lb>
voice had no falter in it now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You show me what I should be. All my life I have<lb>
desired strength of heart and stability of soul; may I not<lb>
hope to earn for myself a little of the integrity I love in<lb>
you? If courage, self-denial, and self-help, make you<lb>
what you are, can I have a more effectual guide? You<lb>
say you shall outlive this passion; why should not I imitate<lb>
your brave example, and find the consolations you shall<lb>
find? Oh, Adam, let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go; go now, while I can say it as I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good Lord bless and help you, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him both her hands, but though he only pressed<lb>
them silently, that pressure nearly destroyed the victory<lb>
she had won, for the strong grasp snapped the slender<lb>
guard-ring Moor had given her a week ago. She heard it<lb>
drop with a golden tinkle on the hearth, saw the dark<lb>
oval, with its doubly significant character, roll into the<lb>
ashes, and felt Warwick's hold tighten as if he echoed the<lb>
emphatic word uttered when the ineffectual gift was first<lb>
bestowed. Superstition flowed in Sylvia's blood, and was<lb>
as unconquerable as the imagination which supplied its<lb>
food. This omen startled her. It seemed a forewarning<lb>

that endeavor would be vain, that submission was wisdom,<lb>
and that the husband's charm had lost its virtue when the<lb>
stronger power claimed her. The desire to resist began to<lb>
waver as the old passionate longing sprang up more eloquent<lb>
than ever; she felt the rush of a coming impulse, knew<lb>
that it would sweep her into Warwick's arms, there to<lb>
forget her duty, to forfeit his respect. With the last effort<lb>
of a sorely tried spirit she tore her hands away, fled up to<lb>
the room which had never needed lock or key till now, and<lb>
stifling the sound of those departing steps among the cushions<lb>
of the little couch where she had wept away childish<lb>
woes and dreamed girlish dreams, she struggled with the<lb>
great sorrow of her too early womanhood, uttering with<lb>
broken voice that petition oftenest quoted from the one<lb>
prayer which expresses all our needs &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">March</hi> winds were howling round the house, the clock<lb>
was striking two, the library lamp still burned, and Moor<lb>
sat writing with an anxious face. Occasionally, he paused<lb>
to look backward through the leaves of the book in which<lb>
he wrote; sometimes he sat with suspended pen, thinking<lb>
deeply; and once or twice he laid it down, to press his hand<lb>
over eyes more weary than the mind that compelled them to<lb>
this late service.</p>
<p>Returning to his work after one of these pauses, he was a<lb>
little startled to see Sylvia standing on the threshold of the<lb>
door. Rising hastily to ask if she were ill, he stopped half<lb>
way across the room, for, with a thrill of apprehension and<lb>
surprise, he saw that she was asleep. Her eyes were open,<lb>
fixed and vacant, her face reposeful, her breathing regular,<lb>
and every sense apparently wrapt in the profoundest unconsciousness.<lb>
Fearful of awakening her too suddenly, Moor<lb>
stood motionless, yet full of interest, for this was his first<lb>
experience of somnambulism, and it was a strange, almost<lb>
an awful sight, to witness the blind obedience of the body<lb>
to the soul that ruled it.</p>
<p>For several minutes she remained where she first appeared.<lb>
Then, as if the dream demanded action, she stooped,<lb>
and seemed to take some object from a chair beside the door,<lb>
<pb n="224">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-229">

<figdesc>Page 224.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
held it an instant, kissed it softly and laid it down. Slowly<lb>
and steadily she went across the room, avoiding all obstacles<lb>
with the unerring instinct that often leads the sleepwalker<lb>
through dangers that appall his waking eyes, and sat<lb>
down in the great chair he had left, leaned her cheek upon<lb>
its arm, and rested tranquilly for several minutes. Soon<lb>
the dream disturbed her, and lifting her head, she bent forward,<lb>
as if addressing or caressing some one seated at her<lb>
feet. Involuntarily her husband smiled; for often when<lb>
they were alone he sat there reading or talking to her, while<lb>
she played with his hair, likening its brown abundance to<lb>
young Milton's curling locks in the picture overhead. The<lb>
smile had hardly risen when it was scared away, for Sylvia<lb>
suddenly sprung up with both hands out, crying in a voice<lb>
that rent the silence with its imploring energy &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you must not speak! I will not hear you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her own cry woke her. Consciousness and memory returned<lb>
together, and her face whitened with a look of terror,<lb>
as her bewildered eyes showed her not Warwick, but her<lb>
husband. This look, so full of fear, yet so intelligent,<lb>
startled Moor more than the apparition or the cry had<lb>
done, for a conviction flashed into his mind that some unsuspected<lb>
trouble had been burdening Sylvia, and was now<lb>
finding vent against her will. Anxious to possess himself<lb>
of the truth, and bent on doing so, he veiled his purpose<lb>
for a time, letting his unchanged manner reassure and compose<lb>
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, don't look so lost and wild. You are quite<lb>
safe, and have only been wandering in your sleep. Why,<lb>
Mrs. Macbeth, have you murdered some one, that you go<lb>
crying out in this uncanny way, frightening me as much as<lb>
I seem to have frightened you?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="225">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-230">

<figdesc>Page 225.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have murdered sleep. What did I do? what did I<lb>
say?&rdquo; she asked, trembling and shrinking as she dropped<lb>
into her chair.</p>
<p>Hoping to quiet her, he took his place on the footstool,<lb>
and told her what had passed. At first, she listened with a<lb>
divided mind, for so strongly was she still impressed with<lb>
the vividness of the dream, she half expected Warwick to<lb>
rise like Banquo, and claim the seat that a single occupancy<lb>
seemed to have made his own. An expression of intense<lb>
relief replaced that of fear, when she had heard all, and<lb>
she composed herself with the knowledge that her secret<lb>
was still hers. For, dreary bosom-guest as it was, she had<lb>
not yet resolved to end her trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What set you walking, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recollect hearing the clock strike one, and thinking I<lb>
would come down to see what you were doing so late, but<lb>
must have dropped off and carried out my design asleep.<lb>
You see I put on wrapper and slippers as I always do,<lb>
when I take nocturnal rambles awake. How pleasant the<lb>
fire feels, and how cosy you look here; no wonder you like<lb>
to stay and enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned forward warming her hands in unconscious<lb>
imitation of Adam, on the night which she had been recalling<lb>
before she slept. Moor watched her with increasing<lb>
disquiet; for never had he seen her in a mood like this.<lb>
She evaded his question, she averted her eyes, she half hid<lb>
her face, and with a gesture that of late had grown habitual,<lb>
seemed to try to hide her heart. Often had she baffled<lb>
him, sometimes grieved him, but never before showed that<lb>
she feared him. This wounded both his love and pride,<lb>
and this fixed his resolution, to wring from her an<lb>
explanation of the changes which had passed over her<lb>
<pb n="226">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-231">

<figdesc>Page 226.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
within those winter months, for they had been many and<lb>
mysterious. As if she feared silence, Sylvia soon spoke<lb>
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you up so late? This is not the first time I<lb>
have seen your lamp burning when I woke. What are you<lb>
studying so deeply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning on the arm of her chair he looked up wistfully,<lb>
tenderly, as if inviting confidence, sueing for affection.<lb>
The words, the look, smote Sylvia to the heart, and but for<lb>
the thought, &ldquo;I have not tried long enough,&rdquo; she would<lb>
have uttered the confession that leaped to her lips. Once<lb>
spoken, it would be too late for secret effort or success, and<lb>
this man's happiest hopes would vanish in a breath. Knowing<lb>
that his nature was almost as sensitively fastidious as a<lb>
woman's, she also knew that the discovery of her love for<lb>
Adam, innocent as it had been, self-denying as it tried to<lb>
be, would forever mar the beauty of his wedded life for<lb>
Moor. No hour of it would seem sacred, no act, look, or<lb>
word of hers entirely his own, nor any of the dear delights<lb>
of home remain undarkened by the shadow of his friend.<lb>
She could not speak yet, and turning her eyes to the fire,<lb>
she asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why study me? Have you no better book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that I love to read so well or have such need to<lb>
understand; because, though nearest and dearest as you are<lb>
to me, I seem to know you less than any friend I have. I<lb>
do not wish to wound you, dear, nor be exacting; but since<lb>
we were married you have grown more shy than ever, and<lb>
the act which should have drawn us tenderly together seems<lb>
to have estranged us. You never talk now of yourself, or<lb>
ask me to explain the working of that busy mind of yours;<lb>
<pb n="227">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-232">

<figdesc>Page 227.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and lately you have sometimes shunned me, as if solitude<lb>
were pleasanter than my society. Is it, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes; I always liked to be alone, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered as truly as she could, feeling that his love<lb>
demanded every confidence but the one cruel one which<lb>
would destroy its peace past help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I had a most tenacious heart, but I hoped it<lb>
was not a selfish one,&rdquo; he sorrowfully said. &ldquo;Now I see<lb>
that it is, and deeply regret that my hopeful spirit, my impatient<lb>
love, has brought disappointment to us both. I<lb>
should have waited longer, should have been less confident<lb>
of my own power to win you, and never let you waste your<lb>
life in vain endeavors to be happy when I was not all to you<lb>
that you expected. I should not have consented to your<lb>
wish to spend the winter here so much alone with me. I<lb>
should have known that such a quiet home and studious<lb>
companion could not have many charms for a young girl<lb>
like you. Forgive me, I will do better, and this one-sided<lb>
life of ours shall be changed; for while I have been supremely<lb>
content you have been miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible to deny it, and with a tearless sob she<lb>
laid her arm about his neck, her head on his shoulder, and<lb>
mutely confessed the truth of what he said. The trouble<lb>
deepened in his face, but he spoke out more cheerfully, believing<lb>
that he had found the secret sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven, nothing is past mending, and we will<lb>
yet be happy. An entire change shall be made; you shall<lb>
no longer devote yourself to me, but I to you. Will you<lb>
go abroad, and forget this dismal home until its rest grows<lb>
inviting, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Geoffrey, not yet. I will learn to make the home<lb>
pleasant, I will work harder, and leave no time for ennui<lb>
<pb n="228">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-233">

<figdesc>Page 228.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and discontent. I promised to make your happiness, and<lb>
I can do it better here than anywhere. Let me try<lb>
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sylvia, you work too hard already; you do everything<lb>
with such vehemence you wear out your body before<lb>
your will is weary, and that brings melancholy. I am very<lb>
credulous, but when I see that acts belie words I cease to<lb>
believe. These months assure me that you are not happy;<lb>
have I found the secret thorn that frets you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer, for truth she could not, and falsehood<lb>
she would not, give him. He rose, went walking to<lb>
and fro, searching memory, heart, and conscience for any<lb>
other cause, but found none, and saw only one way out of his<lb>
bewilderment. He drew a chair before her, sat down, and<lb>
looking at her with the masterful expression dominant in<lb>
his face, asked briefly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, have I been tyrannical, unjust, unkind, since<lb>
you came to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Geoffrey, too generous, too just, too tender!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I claimed any rights but those you gave me, entreated<lb>
or demanded any sacrifices knowingly and wilfully?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I do claim my right to know your heart; I do<lb>
entreat and demand one thing, your confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she felt that the hour had come, and tried to prepare<lb>
to meet it as she should by remembering that she had<lb>
endeavored prayerfully, desperately, despairingly, to do her<lb>
duty, and had failed. Warwick was right, she could not<lb>
forget him. There was such vitality in the man and in the<lb>
sentiment he inspired, that it endowed his memory with a<lb>
power more potent than the visible presence of her husband.<lb>
The knowledge of his love now undid the work that<lb>
<pb n="229">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-234">

<figdesc>Page 229.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="20">
ignorance had helped patience and pride to achieve before. The<lb>
more she struggled to forget, the deeper, dearer, grew the<lb>
yearning that must be denied, till months of fruitless effort<lb>
convinced her that it was impossible to outlive a passion<lb>
more indomitable than will, or penitence, or perseverance.<lb>
Now she saw the wisdom of Adam's warning, and felt that<lb>
he knew both his friend's heart and her own better than<lb>
herself. Now she bitterly regretted that she had not<lb>
spoken out when he was there to help her, and before the<lb>
least deceit had taken the dignity from sorrow. Nevertheless,<lb>
though she trembled she resolved; and while Moor<lb>
spoke on, she made ready to atone for past silence by a perfect<lb>
loyalty to truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, concealment is not generosity, for the heaviest<lb>
trouble shared together could not so take the sweetness from<lb>
my life, the charm from home, or make me more miserable<lb>
than this want of confidence. It is a double wrong, because<lb>
you not only mar my peace but destroy your own by<lb>
wasting health and happiness in vain endeavors to bear<lb>
some grief alone. Your eye seldom meets mine now, your<lb>
words are measured, your actions cautious, your innocent<lb>
gayety all gone. You hide your heart from me, you hide<lb>
your face; I seem to have lost the frank girl whom I loved,<lb>
and found a melancholy woman, who suffers silently till her<lb>
honest nature rebels, and brings her to confession in her<lb>
sleep. There is no page of my life which I have not freely<lb>
shown you; do I do not deserve an equal candor? Shall<lb>
I not receive it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, what stands between us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earnest as a prayer, brief as a command had been the<lb>
<pb n="230">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-235">

<figdesc>Page 230.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
question, instantaneous was the reply, as Sylvia knelt down<lb>
before him, put back the veil that should never hide her<lb>
from him any more, looked up into her husband's face without<lb>
one shadow in her own, and steadily told all.</p>
<p>The revelation was too utterly unexpected, too difficult of<lb>
belief to be at once accepted or understood. Moor started<lb>
at the name, then leaned forward, breathless and intent, as<lb>
if to seize the words before they left her lips; words that<lb>
recalled incidents and acts dark and unmeaning till the<lb>
spark of intelligence fired a long train of memories and<lb>
enlightened him with terrible rapidity. Blinded by his<lb>
own devotion, the knowledge of Adam's love and loss<lb>
seemed gages of his fidelity; the thought that he loved<lb>
Sylvia never had occurred to him, and seemed incredible<lb>
even when her own lips told it. She had been right in<lb>
fearing the effect this knowledge would have upon him. It<lb>
stung his pride, wounded his heart, and forever marred his<lb>
faith in love and friendship. As the truth broke over him,<lb>
cold and bitter as a billow of the sea, she saw gathering in<lb>
his face the still white grief and indignation of an outraged<lb>
spirit, suffering with all a woman's pain, with all a man's<lb>
intensity of passion. His eye grew fiery and stern, the<lb>
veins rose dark upon his forehead, the lines about the<lb>
mouth showed hard and grim, the whole face altered terribly.<lb>
As she looked, Sylvia thanked heaven that Warwick<lb>
was not there to feel the sudden atonement for an innocent<lb>
offence which his friend might have exacted before this natural<lb>
but unworthy temptation had passed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have given all my confidence though I may have<lb>
broken both our hearts in doing it. I do not hope for pardon<lb>
yet, but I am sure of pity, and I leave my fate in your<lb>
hands. Geoffrey, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="231">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-236">

<figdesc>Page 231.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for me,&rdquo; and putting her away, Moor left the<lb>
room.</p>
<p>Suffering too much in mind to remember that she had a<lb>
body, Sylvia remained where she was, and leaning her head<lb>
upon her hands tried to recall what had passed, to nerve<lb>
herself for what was to come. Her first sensation was one<lb>
of unutterable relief. The long struggle was over; the<lb>
haunting care was gone; there was nothing now to conceal;<lb>
she might be herself again, and her spirit rose with something<lb>
of its old elasticity as the heavy burden was removed.<lb>
A moment she enjoyed this hard-won freedom, then the<lb>
memory that the burden was not lost but laid on other<lb>
shoulders, filled her with an anguish too sharp to find vent<lb>
in tears, too deep to leave any hope of cure except in action.<lb>
But how act? She had performed the duty so long, so<lb>
vainly delayed, and when the first glow of satisfaction<lb>
passed, found redoubled anxiety, regret, and pain before<lb>
her. Clear and hard the truth stood there, and no power<lb>
of hers could recall the words that showed it to her husband,<lb>
could give them back the early blindness, or the later<lb>
vicissitudes of hope and fear. In the long silence that filled<lb>
the room she had time to calm her perturbation and comfort<lb>
her remorse by the vague but helpful belief which seldom<lb>
deserts sanguine spirits, that something, as yet unseen and<lb>
unsuspected, would appear to heal the breach, to show what<lb>
was to be done, and to make all happy in the end.</p>
<p>Where Moor went or how long he stayed Sylvia never<lb>
knew, but when at length he came, her first glance showed<lb>
her that pride is as much to be dreaded as passion. No<lb>
gold is without alloy, and now she saw the shadow of a<lb>
nature which had seemed all sunshine. She knew he was<lb>
very proud, but never thought to be the cause of its saddest<lb>
<pb n="232">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-237">

<figdesc>Page 232.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
manifestation; one which showed her that its presence<lb>
could make the silent sorrow of a just and gentle man a<lb>
harder trial to sustain than the hottest anger, the bitterest<lb>
reproach. Scarcely paler than when he went, there was no<lb>
sign of violent emotion in his countenance. His eye shone<lb>
keen and dark, an anxious fold crossed his forehead, and a<lb>
melancholy gravity replaced the cheerful serenity his face<lb>
once wore. Wherein the alteration lay Sylvia could not<lb>
tell, but over the whole man some subtle change had passed.<lb>
The sudden frost which had blighted the tenderest affection<lb>
of his life seemed to have left its chill behind, robbing his<lb>
manner of its cordial charm, his voice of its heartsome ring,<lb>
and giving him the look of one who sternly said &mdash; &ldquo;I must<lb>
suffer, but it shall be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold and quiet, he stood regarding her with a strange<lb>
expression, as if endeavoring to realize the truth, and see<lb>
in her not his wife but Warwick's lover. Oppressed by the<lb>
old fear, now augmented by a measureless regret, she could<lb>
only look up at him feeling that her husband had become<lb>
her judge. Yet as she looked she was conscious of a momentary<lb>
wonder at the seeming transposition of character<lb>
in the two so near and dear to her. Strong-hearted Warwick<lb>
wept like any child, but accepted his disappointment<lb>
without complaint and bore it manfully. Moor, from<lb>
whom she would sooner have expected such demonstration,<lb>
grew stormy first, then stern, as she once believed his friend<lb>
would have done. She forgot that Moor's pain was the<lb>
sharper, his wound the deeper, for the patient hope cherished<lb>
so long; the knowledge that he never had been, never could<lb>
be loved as he loved; the sense of wrong that could not but<lb>
burn even in the meekest heart at such a late discovery<lb>
such an entire loss.</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="20 *">
<p>Sylvia spoke first, not audibly, but with a little gesture of<lb>
supplication, a glance of sorrowful submission. He answered<lb>
both, not by lamentation or reproach, but by just enough of<lb>
his accustomed tenderness in touch and tone to make her<lb>
tears break forth, as he placed her in the ancient chair so<lb>
often occupied together, took the one opposite, and sweeping<lb>
a clear space on the table between them, looked across<lb>
it with the air of a man bent on seeing his way and following<lb>
it at any cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Sylvia, I can listen as I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Geoffrey, what can I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat all you have already told me. I only gathered<lb>
one fact then, now I want the circumstances, for I find this<lb>
confession difficult of belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps no sterner expiation could have been required of<lb>
her than to sit there, face to face, eye to eye, and tell again<lb>
that little history of thwarted love and fruitless endeavor.<lb>
Excitement had given her courage for the first confession,<lb>
now it was torture to carefully repeat what had poured<lb>
freely from her lips before. But she did it, glad to prove<lb>
her penitence by any test he might apply. Tears often<lb>
blinded her, uncontrollable emotion often arrested her; and<lb>
more than once she turned on him a beseeching look, which<lb>
asked as plainly as words, &ldquo;Must I go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Intent on learning all, Moor was unconscious of the trial<lb>
he imposed, unaware that the change in himself was the<lb>
keenest reproach he could have made, and still with a persistency<lb>
as gentle as inflexible, he pursued his purpose to<lb>
the end. When great drops rolled down her cheeks he<lb>
dried them silently; when she paused, he waited till she<lb>
calmed herself; and when she spoke he listened with few<lb>
interruptions but a question now and then. Occasionally a<lb>
<pb n="234">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-239">

<figdesc>Page 234.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sudden flush of passionate pain swept across his face, as<lb>
some phrase, implying rather than expressing Warwick's<lb>
love or Sylvia's longing, escaped the narrator's lips, and<lb>
when she described their parting on that very spot, his eye<lb>
went from her to the hearth her words seemed to make<lb>
desolate, with a glance she never could forget. But when<lb>
the last question was answered, the last appeal for pardon<lb>
brokenly uttered, nothing but the pale pride remained; and<lb>
his voice was cold and quiet as his mien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is this which has baffled and kept me groping in<lb>
the dark so long, for I wholly trusted what I wholly loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, it was that very confidence that made my task seem<lb>
so necessary and so hard. How often I longed to go to you<lb>
with my great trouble as I used to do with lesser ones.<lb>
But here you would suffer more than I; and having done<lb>
the wrong, it was for me to pay the penalty. So like<lb>
many another weak yet willing soul, I tried to keep you<lb>
happy at all costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One frank word before I married you would have spared<lb>
us this. Could you not foresee the end and dare to speak<lb>
it, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it now, I did not then, else I would have spoken<lb>
as freely as I speak to-night. I thought I had outlived my<lb>
love for Adam; it seemed kind to spare you a knowledge<lb>
that would disturb your friendship, so though I told the<lb>
truth, I did not tell it all. I thought temptations came<lb>
from without; I could withstand such, and I did, even<lb>
when it wore Adam's shape. This temptation came so suddenly,<lb>
seemed so harmless, generous and just, that I yielded<lb>
to it unconscious that it was one. Surely I deceived myself<lb>
as cruelly as I did you, and God knows I have tried to<lb>
atone for it when time taught me my fatal error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child, it was too soon for you to play the perilous<lb>
game of hearts. I should have known it, and left you to<lb>
the safe and simple joys of girlhood. Forgive me that I<lb>
have kept you a prisoner so long; take off the fetter I put<lb>
on, and go, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, do not put me from you yet; do not think that I<lb>
can hurt you so, and then be glad to leave you suffering<lb>
alone. Look like your kind self if you can; talk to me<lb>
as you used to; let me show you my heart and you will see<lb>
how large a place you fill in it. Let me begin again, for<lb>
now the secret is told there is no fear to keep out love; and<lb>
I can give my whole strength to learning the lesson you<lb>
have tried so patiently to teach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot, Sylvia. We are as much divorced as if<lb>
judge and jury had decided the righteous but hard separation<lb>
for us. You can never be a wife to me with an unconquerable<lb>
affection in your heart; I can never be your husband<lb>
while the shadow of a fear remains. I will have all or<lb>
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam foretold this. He knew you best, and I should<lb>
have followed the brave counsel he gave me long ago. Oh,<lb>
if he were only here to help us now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The desire broke from Sylvia's lips involuntarily as she<lb>
turned for strength to the strong soul that loved her. But<lb>
it was like wind to smouldering fire; a pang of jealousy<lb>
wrung Moor's heart, and he spoke out with a flash of the<lb>
eye that startled Sylvia more than the rapid change of<lb>
voice and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Say anything of yourself or me, and I can<lb>
bear it, but spare me the sound of Adam's name to-night.<lb>
A man's nature is not forgiving like a woman's, and the<lb>
best of us harbor impulses you know nothing of. If I am<lb>

<figdesc>Page 236.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to lose wife, friend, and home, for God's sake leave me my<lb>
self-respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the coldness and pride passed from Moor's face as<lb>
the climax of his sorrow came; with an impetuous gesture<lb>
he threw his arms across the table, and laid down his head<lb>
in a paroxysm of tearless suffering such as men only know.</p>
<p>How Sylvia longed to speak! But what consolation<lb>
could the tenderest words supply? She searched for some<lb>
alleviating suggestion, some happier hope; none came.<lb>
Her eye turned imploringly to the pictured Fates above her<lb>
as if imploring them to aid her. But they looked back at<lb>
her inexorably dumb, and instinctively her thought passed<lb>
beyond them to the Ruler of all fates, asking the help which<lb>
never is refused. No words embodied her appeal, no sound<lb>
expressed it, only a voiceless cry from the depths of a contrite<lb>
spirit, owning its weakness, making known its want.<lb>
She prayed for submission, but her deeper need was seen,<lb>
and when she asked for patience to endure, Heaven sent her<lb>
power to act, and out of this sharp trial brought her a better<lb>
strength and clearer knowledge of herself than years of<lb>
smoother experience could have bestowed. A sense of security,<lb>
of stability, came to her as that entire reliance assured<lb>
her by its all-sustaining power that she had found what<lb>
she most needed to make life clear to her and duty sweet.<lb>
With her face in her hands, she sat, forgetful that she was<lb>
not alone, as in that brief but precious moment she felt the<lb>
exceeding comfort of a childlike faith in the one Friend<lb>
who, when we are deserted by all, even by ourselves, puts<lb>
forth His hand and gathers us tenderly to Himself.</p>
<p>Her husband's voice recalled her, and looking up she<lb>
showed him such an earnest, patient countenance, it touched<lb>
him like an unconscious rebuke. The first tears she had<lb>
<pb n="237">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-242">

<figdesc>Page 237.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
seen rose to his eyes, and all the old tenderness came back<lb>
into his voice, softening the dismissal which had been more<lb>
coldly begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, silence and rest are best for both of us to-night.<lb>
We cannot treat this trouble as we should till we are calmer;<lb>
then we will take counsel how soonest to end what never<lb>
should have been begun. Forgive me, pray for me, and in<lb>
sleep forget me for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held the door for her, but as she passed Sylvia lifted<lb>
her face for the good night caress without which she had<lb>
never left him since she became his wife. She did not<lb>
speak, but her eye humbly besought this token of forgiveness;<lb>
nor was it denied. Moor laid his hand upon her lips,<lb>
saying, &ldquo;these are Adam's now,&rdquo; and kissed her on the<lb>
forehead.</p>
<p>Such a little thing: But it overcame Sylvia with the<lb>
sorrowful certainty of the loss which had befallen both, and<lb>
she crept away, feeling herself an exile from the heart<lb>
and home whose happy mistress she could never be again.</p>
<p>Moor watched the little figure going upward, and weeping<lb>
softly as it went, as if he echoed the sad &ldquo;never any<lb>
more,&rdquo; which those tears expressed, and when it vanished<lb>
with a backward look, shut himself in alone with his great<lb>
sorrow.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sylvia</hi> laid her head down on her pillow, believing that<lb>
this night would be the longest, saddest she had ever known.<lb>
But before she had time to sigh for sleep it wrapt her in its<lb>
comfortable arms, and held her till day broke. Sunshine<lb>
streamed across the room, and early birds piped on the budding<lb>
boughs that swayed before the window. But no morning<lb>
smile saluted her, no morning flower awaited her, and<lb>
nothing but a little note lay on the unpressed pillow at her<lb>
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, I have gone away to Faith, because this proud,<lb>
resentful spirit of mine must be subdued before I meet you.<lb>
I leave that behind me which will speak to you more kindly,<lb>
calmly than I can now, and show you that my effort has<lb>
been equal to my failure. There is nothing for me to do<lb>
but submit; manfully if I must, meekly if I can; and this<lb>
short exile will prepare me for the longer one to come.<lb>
Take counsel with those nearer and dearer to you than myself,<lb>
and secure the happiness which I have so ignorantly<lb>
delayed, but cannot wilfully destroy. God be with you,<lb>
and through all that is and is to come, remember that you<lb>
remain beloved forever in the heart of Geoffrey Moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia had known many sad uprisings, but never a sadder<lb>
one than this, and the hours that followed aged her more than<lb>
<pb n="239">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-244">

</eaffig>
any year had done. All day she wandered aimlessly to and<lb>
fro, for the inward conflict would not let her rest. The<lb>
house seemed home no longer when its presiding genius was<lb>
gone, and everywhere some token of his former presence<lb>
touched her with its mute reproach.</p>
<p>She asked no counsel of her family, for well she knew the<lb>
outburst of condemnation, incredulity, and grief that would<lb>
assail her there. They could not help her yet; they would<lb>
only augment perplexities, weaken convictions, and distract<lb>
her mind. When she was sure of herself she would tell<lb>
them, endure their indignation and regret, and steadily execute<lb>
the new purpose, whatever it should be.</p>
<p>To many it might seem an easy task to break the bond<lb>
that burdened and assume the tie that blessed. But Sylvia<lb>
had grown wise in self-knowledge, timorous through self-delusion;<lb>
therefore the greater the freedom given her the<lb>
more she hesitated to avail herself of it. The nobler each<lb>
friend grew as she turned from one to the other, the more<lb>
impossible seemed the decision, for generous spirit and loving<lb>
heart contended for the mastery, yet neither won. She<lb>
knew that Moor had put her from him never to be recalled<lb>
till some miracle was wrought that should make her truly<lb>
his. This renunciation showed her how much he had become<lb>
to her, how entirely she had learned to lean upon him,<lb>
and how great a boon such perfect love was in itself. Even<lb>
the prospect of a life with Warwick brought forebodings<lb>
with its hope. Reason made her listen to many doubts<lb>
which hitherto passion had suppressed. Would she never<lb>
tire of his unrest? Could she fill so large a heart and give<lb>
it power as well as warmth? Might not the two wills<lb>
clash, the ardent natures inflame one another, the stronger<lb>
intellect exhaust the weaker, and disappointment come<lb>
<pb n="240">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-245">

</eaffig>
again? And as she asked these questions, conscience, the<lb>
monitor whom no bribe can tempt, no threat silence, invariably<lb>
answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But chief among the cares that beset her was one that<lb>
grew more burdensome with thought. By her own will she<lb>
had put her liberty into another's keeping; law confirmed<lb>
the act, gospel sanctioned the vow, and it could only be<lb>
redeemed by paying the costly price demanded of those who<lb>
own that they have drawn a blank in the lottery of marriage.<lb>
Public opinion is a grim ghost that daunts the<lb>
bravest, and Sylvia knew that trials lay before her from<lb>
which she would shrink and suffer, as only a woman sensitive<lb>
and proud as she could shrink and suffer. Once apply<lb>
this remedy and any tongue would have the power to wound,<lb>
any eye to insult with pity or contempt, any stranger to<lb>
criticise or condemn, and she would have no means of redress,<lb>
no place of refuge, even in that stronghold, Adam's<lb>
heart.</p>
<p>All that dreary day she wrestled with these stubborn<lb>
facts, but could neither mould nor modify them as she<lb>
would, and evening found her spent, but not decided. Too<lb>
excited for sleep, yet too weary for exertion, she turned<lb>
bedward, hoping that the darkness and the silence of night<lb>
would bring good counsel, if not rest.</p>
<p>Till now she had shunned the library as one shuns the<lb>
spot where one has suffered most. But as she passed the<lb>
open door the gloom that reigned within seemed typical of<lb>
that which had fallen on its absent master, and following<lb>
the impulse of the moment Sylvia went in to light it with<lb>
the little glimmer of her lamp. Nothing had been touched,<lb>
for no hand but her own preserved the order of this room,<lb>
and all household duties had been neglected on that day.<lb>

The old chair stood where she had left it, and over its arm<lb>
was thrown the velvet coat, half dressing-gown, half blouse,<lb>
that Moor liked to wear at this household trysting-place.<lb>
Sylvia bent to fold it smoothly as it hung, and feeling that<lb>
she must solace herself with some touch of tenderness, laid<lb>
her cheek against the soft garment, whispering &ldquo;Good<lb>
night.&rdquo; Something glittered on the cushion of the chair,<lb>
and looking nearer she found a steel-clasped book, upon<lb>
the cover of which lay a dead heliotrope, a little key.</p>
<p>It was Moor's Diary, and now she understood that passage<lb>
of the note which had been obscure before. &ldquo;I leave<lb>
that behind me which will speak to you more kindly, calmly,<lb>
than I can now, and show you that my effort has been<lb>
equal to my failure.&rdquo; She had often begged to read it,<lb>
threatened to pick the lock, and felt the strongest curiosity<lb>
to learn what was contained in the long entries that he<lb>
daily made. Her requests had always been answered with<lb>
the promise of entire possession of the book when the year<lb>
was out. Now he gave it, though the year was not gone,<lb>
and many leaves were yet unfilled. He thought she would<lb>
come to this room first, would see her morning flower laid<lb>
ready for her, and, sitting in what they called their Refuge,<lb>
would draw some comfort for herself, some palliation for his<lb>
innocent offence, from the record so abruptly ended.</p>
<p>She took it, went away to her own room, unlocked the<lb>
short romance of his wedded life, and found her husband's<lb>
heart laid bare before her.</p>
<p>It was a strange and solemn thing to look so deeply into<lb>
the private experience of a fellow being; to trace the birth<lb>
and progress of purposes and passions, the motives of action,<lb>
the secret aspirations, the besetting sins that made up the<lb>
inner life he had been leading beside her. Moor wrote<lb>
<pb n="242">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-247">

<figdesc>Page 242.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with an eloquent sincerity, because he had put himself into<lb>
his book, as if feeling the need of some <hi rend="italics">confidante</hi> he had<lb>
chosen the only one that pardons egotism. Here, too,<lb>
Sylvia saw her chameleon self, etched with loving care, endowed<lb>
with all gifts and graces, studied with unflagging<lb>
zeal, and made the idol of a life.</p>
<p>Often a tuneful spirit seemed to assert itself, and passing<lb>
from smooth prose to smoother poetry, sonnet, song, or<lb>
psalm, flowed down the page in cadences stately, sweet, or<lb>
solemn, filling the reader with delight at the discovery of a<lb>
gift so genuine, yet so shyly folded up within itself, unconscious<lb>
that its modesty was the surest token of its worth.<lb>
More than once Sylvia laid her face into the book, and<lb>
added her involuntary comment on some poem or passage<lb>
made pathetic by the present; and more than once paused<lb>
to wonder, with exceeding wonder, why she could not give<lb>
such genius and affection its reward. Had she needed any<lb>
confirmation of the fact so hard to teach herself, this opening<lb>
of his innermost would have given it. For while she<lb>
bitterly grieved over the death-blow she had dealt his happy<lb>
hope, it no longer seemed a possibility to change her stubborn<lb>
heart, or lessen by a fraction the debt which she sadly<lb>
felt could only be repaid in friendship's silver, not love's<lb>
gold.</p>
<p>All night she lay there like some pictured Magdalene,<lb>
purer but as penitent as Correggio's Mary, with the book,<lb>
the lamp, the melancholy eyes, the golden hair that painters<lb>
love. All night she read, gathering courage, not consolation,<lb>
from those pages, for seeing what she was not showed<lb>
her what she might become; and when she turned the little<lb>
key upon that story without an end, Sylvia the girl was<lb>
dead, but Sylvia the woman had begun to live.</p>

</p>
<p>Lying in the rosy hush of dawn, there came to her a<lb>
sudden memory &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever you need help that Geoffrey cannot give, remember<lb>
cousin Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the hour Faith foresaw; Moor had gone to her<lb>
with his trouble, why not follow, and let this woman, wise,<lb>
discreet, and gentle, show her what should come next?</p>
<p>The newly risen sun saw Sylvia away upon her journey to<lb>
Faith's home among the hills. She lived alone, a cheerful,<lb>
busy, solitary soul, demanding little of others, yet giving<lb>
freely to whomsoever asked an alms of her.</p>
<p>Sylvia found the gray cottage nestled in a hollow of the<lb>
mountain side; a pleasant hermitage, secure and still. Mistress<lb>
and maid composed the household, but none of the<lb>
gloom of isolation darkened the sunshine that pervaded it;<lb>
peace seemed to sit upon its threshold, content to brood<lb>
beneath its eaves, and the atmosphere of home to make it<lb>
beautiful.</p>
<p>When some momentous purpose or event absorbs us we<lb>
break through fears and formalities, act out ourselves forgetful<lb>
of reserve, and use the plainest phrases to express<lb>
emotions which need no ornament and little aid from language.<lb>
Sylvia illustrated this fact, then; for, without hesitation<lb>
or embarrassment, she entered Miss Dane's door,<lb>
called no servant to announce her, but went, as if by instinct,<lb>
straight to the room where Faith sat alone, and with<lb>
the simplest greeting asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Geoffrey here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an hour ago, and will be an hour hence. I<lb>
sent him out to rest, for he cannot sleep. I am glad you<lb>
came to him; he has not learned to do without you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no bustle of surprise or sympathy Faith put away<lb>
<pb n="244">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-249">

<figdesc>Page 244.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her work, took off the hat and cloak, drew her guest beside<lb>
her on the couch before the one deep window looking down<lb>
the valley, and gently chafing the chilly hands in warm<lb>
ones, said nothing more till Sylvia spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has told you all the wrong I have done him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and found a little comfort here. Do you need consolation<lb>
also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you ask? But I need something more, and no<lb>
one can give it to me so well as you. I want to be set<lb>
right, to hear things called by their true names, to be taken<lb>
out of myself and made to see why I am always doing<lb>
wrong while trying to do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father, sister, or brother are fitter for that task<lb>
than I. Have you tried them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I will not. They love me, but they could not<lb>
help me; for they would beg me to conceal if I cannot forget,<lb>
to endure if I cannot conquer, and abide by my mistake<lb>
at all costs. That is not the help I want. I desire to<lb>
know the one just thing to be done, and to be made brave<lb>
enough to do it, though friends lament, gossips clamor, and<lb>
the heavens fall. I am in earnest now. Rate me sharply,<lb>
drag out my weaknesses, shame my follies, show no mercy<lb>
to my selfish hopes; and when I can no longer hide from<lb>
myself put me in the way I should go, and I will follow it<lb>
though my feet bleed at every step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in earnest now, terribly so, but still Faith drew<lb>
back, though her compassionate face belied her hesitating<lb>
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Adam; who wiser or more just than he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot. He, as well as Geoffrey, loves me too well<lb>
to decide for me. You stand between them, wise as the<lb>
one, gentle as the other, and you do not care for me enough<lb>

to let affection hoodwink reason. Faith, you bade me come;<lb>
do not cast me off, for if you shut your heart against me I<lb>
know not where to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despairing she spoke, disconsolate she looked, and Faith's<lb>
reluctance vanished. The maternal aspect returned, her<lb>
voice resumed its warmth, her eye its benignity, and Sylvia<lb>
was reassured before a word was spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not cast you off, nor shut my heart against you.<lb>
I only hesitated to assume such responsibility, and shrunk<lb>
from the task because of compassion, not coldness. Sit<lb>
here, and tell me all your trouble, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so kind! It seems quite natural to turn to you<lb>
as if I had a claim upon you. Let me have, and if you<lb>
can, love me a little, because I have no mother, and need<lb>
one very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, you shall not need one any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that, and am comforted already. Faith, if you<lb>
were me, and stood where I stand, beloved by two men,<lb>
either of whom any woman might be proud to call husband,<lb>
putting self away, to which should you cleave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia paled and trembled, as if the oracle she had invoked<lb>
was an unanswerable voice pronouncing the inevitable.<lb>
She watched Faith's countenance a moment, groping<lb>
for her meaning, failed to find it, and whispered below<lb>
her breath &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I know why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your husband <hi rend="italics">is,</hi> your lover <hi rend="italics">should be</hi> your friend<lb>
and nothing more. You have been hardly taught the lesson<lb>
many have to learn, that friendship cannot fill love's place,<lb>
yet should be kept inviolate, and served as an austerer mistress<lb>
who can make life very beautiful to such as feel her<lb>
<pb n="246">

worth and deserve her delights. Adam taught me this,<lb>
for though Geoffrey took you from him, he still held fast<lb>
his friend, letting no disappointment sour, no envy alienate,<lb>
no resentment destroy the perfect friendship years of mutual<lb>
fidelity have built up between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, &ldquo;how I have honored Adam for<lb>
that steadfastness, and how I have despised myself, because<lb>
I could not be as wise and faithful in the earlier, safer sentiment<lb>
I felt for Geoffrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be wise and faithful now; cease to be the wife, but remain<lb>
the friend; freely give all you can with honesty, not<lb>
one jot more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never did man possess a truer friend than I will be to<lb>
him &mdash; if he will let me. But, Faith, if I may be that to<lb>
Geoffrey, may I not be something nearer and dearer to<lb>
Adam? Would not you dare to hope it, were you me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sylvia, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were blind, a cripple, or cursed with some incurable<lb>
infirmity of body, would not you hesitate to bind<lb>
yourself and your affliction to another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I should not only hesitate, but utterly refuse.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know it, therefore I venture to show you why, according<lb>
to my belief, you should not marry Adam. I cannot<lb>
tell you as I ought, but only try to show you where to<lb>
seek the explanation of my seeming harsh advice. There<lb>
are diseases more subtle and dangerous than any that vex<lb>
our flesh; diseases that should be as carefully cured if curable,<lb>
as inexorably prevented from spreading as any malady<lb>
we dread. A paralyzed will, a morbid mind, a mad temper,<lb>
a tainted heart, a blind soul, are afflictions to be as<lb>
<pb n="247">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-252">

<figdesc>Page 247.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
much regarded as bodily infirmities. Nay, more, inasmuch<lb>
as souls are of greater value than perishable flesh.<lb>
Where this is religiously taught, believed, and practised,<lb>
marriage becomes in truth a sacrament blessed of God;<lb>
children thank parents for the gift of life; parents see in<lb>
children living satisfactions and rewards, not reproaches or<lb>
retributions doubly heavy to be borne, for the knowledge<lb>
that where two sinned, many must inevitably suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You try to tell me gently, Faith, but I see that you<lb>
consider me one of the innocent unfortunates, who have no<lb>
right to marry till they be healed, perhaps never. I have<lb>
dimly felt this during the past year, now I know it, and<lb>
thank God that I have no child to reproach me hereafter,<lb>
for bequeathing it the mental ills I have not yet outlived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sylvia, you are an exceptional case in all respects,<lb>
because an extreme one. The ancient theology of two contending<lb>
spirits in one body, is strangely exemplified in you,<lb>
for each rules by turns, and each helps or hinders as moods<lb>
and circumstances lead. Even in the great event of a woman's<lb>
life, you were thwarted by conflicting powers; impulse<lb>
and ignorance, passion and pride, hope and despair.<lb>
Now you stand at the parting of the ways, looking wistfully<lb>
along the pleasant one where Adam seems to beckon, while<lb>
I point down the rugged one where I have walked, and<lb>
though my heart aches as I do it, counsel you as I would a<lb>
daughter of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, I will follow you, but my life looks very<lb>
barren if I must relinquish my desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as barren as if you possessed your desire, and<lb>
found in it another misery and mistake. Could you have<lb>
loved Geoffrey, it might have been safe and well with you;<lb>
loving Adam, it is neither. Let me show you why. He is<lb>

an exception like yourself; perhaps that explains your attraction<lb>
for each other. In him the head rules, in Geoffrey<lb>
the heart. The one criticises, the other loves mankind.<lb>
Geoffrey is proud and private in all that lies nearest him,<lb>
clings to persons, and is faithful as a woman. Adam has<lb>
only the pride of an intellect which tests all things, and<lb>
abides by its own insight. He clings to principles; persons<lb>
are but animated facts or ideas; he seizes, searches, uses<lb>
them, and when they have no more for him, drops them like<lb>
the husk, whose kernel he has secured; passing on to find<lb>
and study other samples without regret, but with unabated<lb>
zeal. For life to him is perpetual progress, and he obeys<lb>
the law of his nature as steadily as sun or sea. Is not this<lb>
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All true; what more, Faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few women, if wise, would dare to marry this man,<lb>
noble and love-worthy as he is, till time has tamed and<lb>
experience developed him. Even then the risk is great, for<lb>
he demands and unconsciously absorbs into himself the<lb>
personality of others, making large returns, but of a kind<lb>
which only those as strong, sagacious, and steadfast as<lb>
himself can receive and adapt to their individual uses,<lb>
without being overcome and possessed. That none of us<lb>
should be, except by the Spirit stronger than man, purer<lb>
than woman. You feel, though you do not understand this<lb>
power. You know that his presence excites, yet wearies<lb>
you; that, while you love, you fear him, and even when<lb>
you long to be all in all to him, you doubt your ability to<lb>
make his happiness. Am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, it is scarcely necessary for me to tell you that I<lb>
think this unequal marriage would be but a brief one for<lb>

you; bright at its beginning, dark at its end. With him<lb>
you would exhaust yourself in passionate endeavors to follow<lb>
where he led. He would not know this, you would not<lb>
confess it, but too late you might both learn that you were<lb>
too young, too ardent, too frail in all but the might of love,<lb>
to be his wife. It is like a woodbird mating with an eagle,<lb>
straining its little wings to scale the sky with him, blinding<lb>
itself with gazing at the sun, striving to fill and warm<lb>
the wild eyrie which becomes its home, and perishing in<lb>
the stern solitude the other loves. Yet, too fond and faithful<lb>
to regret the safer nest among the grass, the gentler<lb>
mate it might have had, the summer life and winter flitting<lb>
to the south for which it was designed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, you frighten me; you seem to see and show me all<lb>
the dim forebodings I have hidden away within myself,<lb>
because I could not understand or dared not face them.<lb>
How have you learned so much? How can you read me so<lb>
well? and who told you these things of us all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had an unhappy girlhood in a discordant home; early<lb>
cares and losses made me old in youth, and taught me to<lb>
observe how others bore their burdens. Since then solitude<lb>
has led me to study and reflect upon the question toward<lb>
which my thoughts inevitably turned. Concerning yourself<lb>
and your past Geoffrey told me much but Adam more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him? Has he been here? When,<lb>
Faith, when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light and color flashed back into Sylvia's face, and the<lb>
glad eagerness of her voice was a pleasant sound to hear<lb>
after the despairing accents gone before. Faith sighed, but<lb>
answered fully, carefully, while the compassion of her look<lb>
deepened as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him but a week ago, vehement and vigorous as<lb>
<pb n="250">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-255">

<figdesc>Page 250.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
ever. He has come hither often during the winter, has<lb>
watched you unseen, and brought me news of you which<lb>
made Geoffrey's disclosure scarcely a surprise. He said<lb>
you bade him hear of you through me, that he preferred to<lb>
come, not write, for letters were often false interpreters,<lb>
but face to face one gets the real thought of one's friend by<lb>
look, as well as word, and the result is satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Adam! But what more did he say? How did<lb>
you advise him? I know he asked counsel of you, as we<lb>
all have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, and I gave it as frankly as to you and Geoffrey.<lb>
He made me understand you, judge you leniently,<lb>
see in you the virtues you have cheri hed despite drawbacks<lb>
such as few have to struggle with. Your father made<lb>
Adam his confessor during the happy month when you first<lb>
knew him. I need not tell you how he received and preserved<lb>
such a trust. He betrayed no confidence, but in<lb>
speaking of you I saw that his knowledge of the father<lb>
taught him to understand the daughter. It was well and<lb>
beautifully done, and did we need anything to endcar him<lb>
to us this trait of character would do it, for it is a rare endowment,<lb>
the power of overcoming all obstacles of pride,<lb>
age, and the sad reserve self-condemnation brings us, and<lb>
making confession a grateful healing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it; we tell our sorrows to such as Geoffrey, our<lb>
sins to such as Adam. But, Faith, when you spoke of me,<lb>
did you say to him what you have been saying to me about<lb>
my unfitness to be his wife because of inequality, and my<lb>
unhappy inheritance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I do otherwise when he fixed that commanding<lb>
eye of his upon me asking, `Is my love as wise as it is<lb>
warm?' He is one of those who force the hardest truths<lb>
<pb n="251">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-256">

<figdesc>Page 251.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
from us by the simple fact that they can bear it, and would<lb>
do the same for us. He needed it then, for though instinct<lb>
was right, &mdash; hence his anxious question, &mdash; his heart, never<lb>
so entirely roused as now, made it difficult for him to judge<lb>
of your relations to one another, and there my woman's insight<lb>
helped him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do when you told him? I see that you<lb>
will yet hesitate to tell me. I think you have been preparing<lb>
me to hear it. Speak out. Though my cheeks<lb>
whiten and my hands tremble I can bear it, for you shall<lb>
be the law by which I will abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be a law to yourself, my brave Sylvia. Put<lb>
your hands in mine and hold fast to the friend who loves<lb>
and honors you for this. I will tell you what Adam did<lb>
and said. He sat in deep thought many minutes; but with<lb>
him to see is to do, and soon he turned to me with the<lb>
courageous expression which in him signifies that the fight<lb>
is fought, the victory won. `It is necessary to be just, it<lb>
is not necessary to be happy. I shall never marry Sylvia,<lb>
even if I may,' &mdash; and with that paraphrase of words,<lb>
whose meaning seemed to fit his need, he went away. I<lb>
think he will not come again either to me &mdash; or you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How still the room grew as Faith's reluctant lips uttered<lb>
the last words! Sylvia sat motionless looking out into the<lb>
sunny valley, with eyes that saw nothing but the image of<lb>
that beloved friend leaving her perhaps forever. Well she<lb>
knew that with this man to see <hi rend="italics">was</hi> to do, and with a woful<lb>
sense of deselation falling cold upon her heart, she felt<lb>
that there was nothing more to hope for but a brave submission<lb>
like his own. Yet in that pause there came a feeling<lb>
of relief after the first despair. The power of choice was no<lb>
longer left her, and the help she needed was bestowed by<lb>
<pb n="252">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-257">

<figdesc>Page 252.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
one who could decide against himself, inspired by a sentiment<lb>
which curbed a strong man's love of power, and made<lb>
it subject to a just man's love of right. Great examples<lb>
never lose their virtue; what Pompey was to Warwick that<lb>
Warwick became to Sylvia, and in the moment of supremest<lb>
sorrow she felt the fire of a noble emulation kindling within<lb>
her from the spark he left behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, what comes next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; and she was gathered close while Faith confessed<lb>
how hard her task had been by letting tears fall fast upon<lb>
the head which seemed to have found its proper resting-place,<lb>
as if despite her courage and her wisdom the woman's<lb>
heart was half broken with its pity. Better than any words<lb>
was the motherly embrace, the silent shower, the blessed<lb>
balm of sympathy which soothed the wounds it could not<lb>
heal. Leaning against each other the two hearts talked<lb>
together in the silence, feeling the beauty of the tie kind<lb>
Nature weaves between the hearts that should be knit.<lb>
Faith often turned her lips to Sylvia's forehead, brushed<lb>
back her hair with a lingering touch, and drew her nearer<lb>
as if it was very pleasant to see and feel the little creature<lb>
in her arms. Sylvia lay there, tearless and tranquil;<lb>
thinking thoughts for which she had no words, and trying<lb>
to prepare herself for the life to come, a life that now looked<lb>
very desolate. Her eye still rested on the valley where the<lb>
river flowed, the elms waved their budding boughs in the<lb>
bland air, and the meadows wore their earliest tinge of<lb>
green. But she was not conscious of these things till<lb>
the sight of a solitary figure coming slowly up the hill<lb>
recalled her to the present and the duties it still held<lb>
for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is Geoffrey! How wearily he walks, &mdash; how<lb>
<pb n="253">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-258">

<figdesc>Page 253.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="22">
changed and old he looks, &mdash; oh, why was I born to be a<lb>
curse to all who love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Sylvia, say anything but that, because it casts<lb>
reproach upon your father. Your life is but just begun;<lb>
make it a blessing, not a curse, as all of us have power to<lb>
do; and remember that for every affliction there are two<lb>
helpers, who can heal or end the heaviest we know &mdash; Time<lb>
and Death. The first we may invoke and wait for; the<lb>
last God alone can send when it is better not to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to be patient. Will you meet and tell<lb>
Geoffrey what has passed? I have no strength left but for<lb>
passive endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith went; Sylvia heard the murmur of earnest conversation;<lb>
then steps came rapidly along the hall, and<lb>
Moor was in the room. She rose involuntarily, but for a<lb>
moment neither spoke, for never had they met as now.<lb>
Each regarded the other as if a year had rolled between<lb>
them since they parted, and each saw in the other the<lb>
changes that one day had wrought. Neither the fire of resentment<lb>
nor the frost of pride now rendered Moor's face<lb>
stormy or stern. Anxious and worn it was, with newly<lb>
graven lines upon the forehead and melancholy curves about<lb>
the mouth, but the peace of a conquered spirit touched it<lb>
with a pale serenity, and some perennial hope shone in the<lb>
glance he bent upon his wife. For the first time in her life<lb>
Sylvia was truly beautiful, &mdash; not physically, for never had<lb>
she looked more weak and wan, but spiritually, as the inward<lb>
change made itself manifest in an indescribable<lb>
expression of meekness and of strength. With suffering<lb>
came submission, with repentance came regeneration, and<lb>
the power of the woman yet to be, touched with beauty the<lb>
pathos of the woman now passing through the fire.</p>

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith has told you what has passed between us, and<lb>
you know that my loss is a double one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let<lb>
me add that I deserve it, that I clearly see my mistakes,<lb>
will amend such as I can, bear the consequences of such as<lb>
are past help, try to profit by all, and make no new ones.<lb>
I cannot be your wife, I ought not to be Adam's; but I<lb>
may be myself, may live my life alone, and being friends<lb>
with both wrong neither. This is my decision; in it I believe,<lb>
by it I will abide, and if it be a just one God will<lb>
not let me fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I submit, Sylvia; I can still hope and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So humbly he said it, so heartily he meant it, she felt<lb>
that his love was as indomitable as Warwick's will, and the<lb>
wish that it were right and possible to accept and reward it<lb>
woke with all its old intensity. It was not possible; and<lb>
though her heart grew heavier within her, Sylvia answered<lb>
steadily &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Geoffrey, do not hope, do not wait; forgive me and<lb>
forget me. Go abroad as you proposed; travel far and stay<lb>
long away. Change your life, and learn to see in me only<lb>
the friend I once was and still desire to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go, will stay till you recall me, but while you<lb>
live your life alone I shall still hope and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This invincible fidelity, so patient, so persistent, impressed<lb>
the listener like a prophecy, disturbed her conviction,<lb>
arrested the words upon her lips and softened them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for one so unstable as myself to say, `I shall never<lb>
change.' I do not say it, though I heartily believe it, but<lb>
will leave all to time. Surely I may do this; may let<lb>
separation gently, gradually convince you or alter me; and<lb>
as the one return which I can make for all you have given<lb>
me, let this tie between us remain unbroken for a little<lb>
<pb n="255">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-260">

longer. Take this poor consolation with you; it is the best<lb>
that I can offer now. Mine is the knowledge that however<lb>
I may thwart your life in this world, there is a beautiful<lb>
eternity in which you will forget me and be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him comfort, but he robbed her of her own as<lb>
he drew her to him, answering with a glance brighter than<lb>
any smile &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is immortal, dear, and even in the `beautiful<lb>
eternity' I shall still hope and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How soon it was all over! the return to separate homes,<lb>
the disclosures, and the storms; the preparations for the<lb>
solitary voyage, the last charges and farewells.</p>
<p>Mark would not, and Prue could not, go to see the traveller<lb>
off; the former being too angry to lend his countenance<lb>
to what he termed a barbarous banishment, the latter,<lb>
being half blind with crying, stayed to nurse Jessie, whose<lb>
soft heart was nearly broken at what seemed to her the most<lb>
direful affliction under heaven.</p>
<p>But Sylvia and her father followed Moor till his foot<lb>
left the soil, and still lingered on the wharf to watch the<lb>
steamer out of port. An uncongenial place in which to<lb>
part; carriages rolled up and down, a clamor of voices filled<lb>
the air, the little steamtug snorted with impatience, and<lb>
the waves flowed seaward with the ebbing of the tide.<lb>
But father and daughter saw only one object, heard only<lb>
one sound, Moor's face as it looked down upon them from<lb>
the deck, Moor's voice as he sent cheery messages to those<lb>
left behind. Mr. Yule was endeavoring to reply as cheerily,<lb>
and Sylvia was gazing with eyes that saw very dimly<lb>
through their tears, when both were aware of an instantaneous<lb>
change in the countenance they watched. Something<lb>
<pb n="256">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-261">

<figdesc>Page 256.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
beyond themselves seemed to arrest Moor's eye; a moment<lb>
he stood intent and motionless, then flushed to the forehead<lb>
with the dark glow Sylvia remembered well, waved<lb>
his hand to them and vanished down the cabin stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, what did he see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no need of any answer; Adam Warwick came<lb>
striding through the crowd, saw them, paused with both<lb>
hands out, and a questioning glance as if uncertain of his<lb>
greeting. With one impulse the hands were taken; Sylvia<lb>
could not speak, her father could, and did approvingly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Warwick; you are come to say good by to<lb>
Geoffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather to you, sir; he needs none, I go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With him!&rdquo; echoed both hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that I will. Did you think I would let him go<lb>
away alone feeling bereaved of wife, and home, and<lb>
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have known you better. But, Warwick,<lb>
he will shun you; he hid himself just now as you approached;<lb>
he has tried to forgive, but he cannot so soon<lb>
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more need of my helping him to do both. He<lb>
cannot shun me long with no hiding-place to fly to but the<lb>
sea, and I will so gently constrain him by the old-time love<lb>
we bore each other, that he must relent and take me back<lb>
into his heart again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Adam! go with him, stay with him, and bring<lb>
him safely back to me when time has helped us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do it, God willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unmindful of all else Warwick bent and took her to him<lb>
as he gave the promise, seemed to put his whole heart into<lb>
a single kiss and left her trembling with the stress of his<lb>
<pb n="257">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-262">

<figdesc>Page 257.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="22 *">
farewell. She saw him cleave his way through the throng,<lb>
leap the space left by the gangway just withdrawn, and<lb>
vanish in search of that lost friend. Then she turned her<lb>
face to her father's shoulder, conscious of nothing but the<lb>
fact that Warwick had come and gone.</p>
<p>A cannon boomed, the crowd cheered, the last cable was<lb>
flung off, and the steamer glided from her moorings with<lb>
the surge of water and the waft of wind like some seamonster<lb>
eager to be out upon the ocean free again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up, Sylvia; she will soon pass from sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I do not care to see. Look for me, father, and<lb>
tell me when they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not come, dear; both have said good by,<lb>
and we have seen the last of them for many a long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come! Adam will bring Geoffrey to show<lb>
me they are friends again. I know it; you shall see it.<lb>
Lift me to that block and watch the deck with me that we<lb>
may see them the instant they appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up she sprung, eyes clear now, nerves steady, faith<lb>
strong. Leaning forward so utterly forgetful of herself,<lb>
she would have fallen into the green water tumbling there<lb>
below, had not her father held her fast. How slowly the<lb>
minutes seemed to pass, how rapidly the steamer seemed to<lb>
glide away, how heavily the sense of loss weighed on her<lb>
heart as wave after wave rolled between her and her heart's<lb>
desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, Sylvia, it is giving yourself useless pain<lb>
to watch and wait. Come home, my child, and let us comfort<lb>
one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not hear him, for as he spoke the steamer swung<lb>
<pb n="258">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-263">

<figdesc>Page 258.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
slowly round to launch itself into the open bay, and with a<lb>
cry that drew many eyes upon the young figure with its<lb>
face of pale expectancy, Sylvia saw her hope fulfilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew they would come! See, father, see! Geoffrey<lb>
is smiling as he waves his handkerchief, and Adam's hand<lb>
is on his shoulder. Answer them! oh, answer them! I<lb>
can only look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man did answer them enthusiastically, and Sylvia<lb>
stretched her arms across the widening space as if to<lb>
bring them back again. Side by side the friends stood<lb>
now; Moor's eye upon his wife, while from his hand the<lb>
little flag of peace streamed in the wind. But Warwick's<lb>
glance was turned upon his friend, and Warwick's hand<lb>
already seemed to claim the charge he had accepted.</p>
<p>Standing thus they passed from sight, never to come<lb>
sailing home together as the woman on the shore was praying<lb>
God to let her see them come.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ensuing half year seemed fuller of duties and events<lb>
than any Sylvia had ever known. At first she found it<lb>
very hard to live her life alone; for inward solitude oppressed<lb>
her, and external trials were not wanting. Only to the<lb>
few who had a right to know, had the whole trouble been<lb>
confided. They were discreet from family pride, if from no<lb>
tenderer feeling; but the curious world outside of that small<lb>
circle was full of shrewd surmises, of keen eyes for discovering<lb>
domestic breaches, and shrill tongues for proclaiming<lb>
them. Warwick escaped suspicion, being so little known,<lb>
so seldom seen; but for the usual nine days matrons and<lb>
venerable maids wagged their caps, lifted their hands, and<lb>
sighed as they sipped their dish of scandal and of tea &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor young man! I always said how it would be, she<lb>
was so peculiar. My dear creature have n't you heard that<lb>
Mrs. Moor is n't happy with her husband, and that he has<lb>
gone abroad quite broken-hearted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia felt this deeply, but received it as her just punishment,<lb>
and bore herself so meekly that public opinion soon<lb>
turned a somersault, and the murmur changed to &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor young thing! what could she expect? My dear,<lb>
I have it from the best authority, that Mr. Moor has made<lb>
her miserable for a year, and now left her broken-hearted.&rdquo;<lb>
<pb n="260">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-265">

<figdesc>Page 260.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
After that, the gossips took up some newer tragedy, and left<lb>
Mrs. Moor to mend her heart as best she could, a favor very<lb>
gratefully received.</p>
<p>As Hester Prynne seemed to see some trace of her own<lb>
sin in every bosom, by the glare of the Scarlet Letter<lb>
burning on her own; so Sylvia, living in the shadow of a<lb>
household grief, found herself detecting various phases of<lb>
her own experience in others. She had joined that sad<lb>
sisterhood called disappointed women; a larger class than<lb>
many deem it to be, though there are few of us who have<lb>
not seen members of it. Unhappy wives; mistaken or forsaken<lb>
lovers; meek souls, who make life a long penance for<lb>
the sins of others; gifted creatures kindled into fitful brilliancy<lb>
by some inward fire that consumes but cannot warm.<lb>
These are the women who fly to convents, write bitter books,<lb>
sing songs full of heartbreak, act splendidly the passion they<lb>
have lost or never won. Who smile, and try to lead brave<lb>
uncomplaining lives, but whose tragic eyes betray them,<lb>
whose voices, however sweet or gay, contain an undertone<lb>
of hopelessness, whose faces sometimes startle one with<lb>
an expression which haunts the observer long after it is<lb>
gone.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Sylvia would have joined the melancholy<lb>
chorus, and fallen to lamenting that ever she was born, had<lb>
she not possessed a purpose that took her out of herself and<lb>
proved her salvation. Faith's words took root and blossomed.<lb>
Intent on making her life a blessing, not a reproach<lb>
to her father, she lived for him entirely. He had<lb>
taken her back to him, as if the burden of her unhappy<lb>
past should be upon his shoulders, the expiation of her<lb>
faults come from him alone. Sylvia understood this now,<lb>
and nestled to him so gladly, so confidingly, he seemed to<lb>
<pb n="261">

</eaffig>
have found again the daughter he had lost and be almost<lb>
content to have her all his own.</p>
<p>How many roofs cover families or friends who live years<lb>
together, yet never truly know each other; who love, and<lb>
long and try to meet, yet fail to do so till some unexpected<lb>
emotion or event performs the work. In the weeks that<lb>
followed the departure of the friends, Sylvia discovered this<lb>
and learned to know her father. No one was so much to her<lb>
as he; no one so fully entered into her thoughts and feelings;<lb>
for sympathy drew them tenderly together, and sorrow<lb>
made them equals. As man and woman they talked, as<lb>
father and daughter they loved; and the beautiful relation<lb>
became their truest solace and support.</p>
<p>Miss Yule both rejoiced at and rebelled against this;<lb>
was generous, yet mortally jealous; made no complaint, but<lb>
grieved in private, and one fine day amazed her sister by<lb>
announcing, that, being of no farther use at home, she had<lb>
decided to be married. Both Mr. Yule and Sylvia had<lb>
desired this event, but hardly dared to expect it in spite<lb>
of sundry propitious signs and circumstances.</p>
<p>A certain worthy widower had haunted the house of late,<lb>
evidently on matrimonial thoughts intent. A solid gentleman,<lb>
both physically and financially speaking; possessed of<lb>
an ill-kept house, bad servants, and nine neglected children.<lb>
This prospect, however alarming to others, had great<lb>
charms for Prue; nor was the Reverend Gamaliel Bliss repugnant<lb>
to her, being a rubicund, bland personage, much<lb>
given to fine linen, long dinners, and short sermons. His<lb>
third spouse had been suddenly translated, and though the year of mourning had not yet expired, things went so hardly<lb>
with Gamaliel, that he could no longer delay casting his<lb>
pastoral eyes over the flock which had already given three<lb>
<pb n="262">

<figdesc>Page 262.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
lambs to his fold, in search of a fourth. None appeared<lb>
whose meek graces were sufficiently attractive, or whose<lb>
dowries were sufficiently large. Meantime the nine olivebranches<lb>
grew wild, the servants revelled, the ministerial<lb>
digestion suffered, the sacred shirts went buttonless, and<lb>
their wearer was wellnigh distraught. At this crisis he<lb>
saw Prudence, and fell into a way of seating himself before<lb>
the well-endowed spinster, with a large cambric pockethandkerchief<lb>
upon his knee, a frequent tear meandering<lb>
down his florid countenance, and volcanic sighs agitating<lb>
his capacious waistcoat as he poured his woes into her ear.<lb>
Prue had been deeply touched by these moist appeals, and<lb>
was not much surprised when the reverend gentleman went<lb>
ponderously down upon his knee before her in the good<lb>
old-fashioned style which frequent use had endeared to him,<lb>
murmuring with an appropriate quotation and a subterranean<lb>
sob &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Yule, `a good wife is a crown to her husband;'<lb>
be such an one to me, unworthy as I am, and a mother to<lb>
my bereaved babes, who suffer for a tender woman's care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She merely upset her sewing-table with an appropriate<lb>
start, but speedily recovered, and with a maidenly blush<lb>
murmured in return &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, how very unexpected! pray speak to papa, &mdash;<lb>
oh, rise, I beg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me Gamaliel, and I obey!&rdquo; gasped the stout lover,<lb>
divided between rapture and doubts of his ability to perform<lb>
the feat alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gam-aliel,&rdquo; sighed Prue, surrendering her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Prudence, blessed among women!&rdquo; responded the<lb>
blissful Bliss. And having saluted the fair member, allowed<lb>
it to help him rise; when, after a few decorous endearments,<lb>
<pb n="263">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-268">

<figdesc>Page 263.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
he departed to papa, and the bride elect rushed up to<lb>
Sylvia with the incoherent announcement &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest child, I have accepted him! It was such<lb>
a surprise, though so touchingly done. I was positively<lb>
mortified; Maria had swept the room so ill, his knees were<lb>
white with lint, and I'm a very happy woman, bless you,<lb>
love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, and tell me all about it,&rdquo; cried her sister.<lb>
&ldquo;Don't try to sew, but cry if you like, and let me pet you,<lb>
for indeed I am rejoiced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Prue preferred to rock violently, and boggle down a<lb>
seam as the best quietus for her fluttered nerves, while she<lb>
told her romance, received congratulations, and settled a<lb>
few objections made by Sylvia, who tried to play the prudent<lb>
matron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he is too old for you, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the age; a man should always be ten years older<lb>
than his wife. A woman of thirty-five is in the prime of<lb>
life, and if she has n't arrived at years of discretion then<lb>
she never will. Shall I wear pearl-colored silk and a white<lb>
bonnet, or just a very handsome travelling dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whichever you like. But, Prue, is n't he rather stout,<lb>
I won't say corpulent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, how can you! Because papa is a shadow, you<lb>
call a fine, manly person like Gam &mdash; Mr. Bliss, corpulent.<lb>
I always said I would <hi rend="italics">not</hi> marry an invalid, (Macgregor<lb>
died of apoplexy last week, I heard, at a small dinner<lb>
party; fell forward with his head upon the cheese, and<lb>
expired without a groan,) and where can you find a more<lb>
robust and healthy man than Mr. Bliss? Not a gray hair,<lb>
and gout his only complaint. So aristocratic. You know<lb>
I've loads of fine old flannel, just the thing for him.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="264">
<p>

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Sylvia commanded her countenance with difficulty, and<lb>
went on with her maternal inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a personable man, and an excellent one, I believe,<lb>
yet I should rather dread the responsibility of nine small<lb>
children, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are my chief inducement to the match. Just<lb>
think of the state those dears must be in, with only a young<lb>
governess, and half a dozen giddy maids to see to them. I<lb>
long to be among them, and named an early day, because<lb>
measles and scarlatina are coming round again, and only<lb>
Fanny, and the twins, Gus and Gam, have had either. I<lb>
know all their names and ages, dispositions, and characters<lb>
and love them like a mother already. He perfectly<lb>
adores them, and that is very charming in a learned man<lb>
like Mr. Bliss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is your feeling it will all go well I have<lb>
no doubt. But, Prue, &mdash; I don't wish to be unkind, dear,&mdash;<lb>
do you quite like the idea of being the fourth Mrs.<lb>
Bliss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, I never thought of that! Poor man, it only<lb>
shows how much he must need consolation, and proves how<lb>
good a husband he must have been. No, Sylvia, I don't<lb>
care a particle. I never knew those estimable ladies, and<lb>
the memory of them shall not keep me from making Gamaliel<lb>
happy if I can. What he goes through now is almost<lb>
beyond belief. My child, just think! &mdash; the coachman<lb>
drinks; the cook has tea-parties whenever she likes, and<lb>
supports her brother's family out of her perquisites, as she<lb>
calls her bare-faced thefts; the house maids romp with the<lb>
indoor man, and have endless followers; three old maids<lb>
set their caps at him, and that hussy, (I must use a strong<lb>
expression,) that hussy of a governess makes love to him<lb>
<pb n="265">

<milestn unit="collation" n="23">
before the children. It is my duty to marry him; I shall<lb>
do it, and put an end to this fearful state of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia asked but one more question &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, seriously, do you love him very much? Will he<lb>
make you as happy as my dear old girl should be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prue dropped her work, and hiding her face on Sylvia's<lb>
shoulder, answered with a plaintive sniff or two, and much<lb>
real feeling &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I do. I tried to love him, and I did not<lb>
fail. I shall be happy, for I shall be busy. I am not<lb>
needed here any more, and so I am glad to go away into a<lb>
home of my own, feeling sure that you can fill my place; and<lb>
Maria knows my ways too well to let things go amiss. Now,<lb>
kiss me, and smooth my collar, for papa may call me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sisters embraced and cried a little, as women usually<lb>
find it necessary to do at such interesting times; then<lb>
fell to planning the wedding outfit, and deciding between<lb>
the &ldquo;light silk and white bonnet,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;handsome travelling<lb>
suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Yule made a great sacrifice to the propricties by<lb>
relinquishing her desire for a stately wedding, and much<lb>
to Sylvia's surprise and relief, insisted that, as the family<lb>
was then situated, it was best to have no stir or parade,<lb>
but to be married quietly at church and slip unostentatiously<lb>
out of the old life into the new. Her will was law,<lb>
and as the elderly bridegroom felt that there was no time<lb>
to spare, and the measles continued to go about seeking<lb>
whom they might devour, Prue did not keep him waiting<lb>
long. &ldquo;Three weeks is very little time, and nothing will<lb>
be properly done, for one must have everything new when<lb>
one is married of course, and mantua-makers are but mortal<lb>
women (exorbitant in their charges this season, I assure<lb>
<pb n="266">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-271">

<figdesc>Page 266.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
you), so be patient, Gamaliel, and spend the time in teaching<lb>
my little ones to love me before I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest creature, I will.&rdquo; And well did the enamored<lb>
gentleman perform his promise.</p>
<p>Prue kept hers so punctually that she was married with<lb>
the bastings in her wedding gown and two dozen pockethandkerchiefs<lb>
still unhemmed; facts which disturbed her<lb>
even during the ceremony. A quiet time throughout; and<lb>
after a sober feast, a tearful farewell, Mrs. Gamaliel Bliss<lb>
departed, leaving a great void behind and carrying joy to<lb>
the heart of her spouse, comfort to the souls of the excited<lb>
nine, destruction to the &ldquo;High Life Below Stairs,&rdquo; and<lb>
order, peace, and plenty to the realm over which she was<lb>
to know a long and prosperous reign.</p>
<p>Hardly had the excitement of this event subsided when<lb>
another occurred to keep Sylvia from melancholy and bring<lb>
an added satisfaction to her lonely days. Across the sea<lb>
there came to her a little book, bearing her name upon its<lb>
title-page. Quaintly printed, and bound in some foreign<lb>
style, plain and unassuming without, but very rich within,<lb>
for there she found Warwick's Essays, and between each<lb>
of these one of the poems from Moor's Diary. Far away<lb>
there in Switzerland they had devised this pleasure for her,<lb>
and done honor to the woman whom they both loved, by<lb>
dedicating to her the first fruits of their lives. &ldquo;Alpen<lb>
Rosen&rdquo; was its title, and none could have better suited it<lb>
in Sylvia's eyes, for to her Warwick was the Alps and<lb>
Moor the roses. Each had helped the other; Warwick's<lb>
rugged prose gathered grace from Moor's poetry, and<lb>
Moor's smoothly flowing lines acquired power from Warwick's<lb>
prose. Each had given her his best, and very<lb>
proud was Sylvia of the little book, over which she pored<lb>
<pb n="267">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-272">

<figdesc>Page 267.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
day after day, living on and in it, eagerly collecting all<lb>
praises, resenting all censures, and thinking it the one perfect<lb>
volume in the world.</p>
<p>Others felt and acknowledged its worth as well, for<lb>
though fashionable libraries were not besieged by inquiries<lb>
for it, and no short-lived enthusiasm welcomed it, a place<lb>
was found for it on many study tables, where real work was<lb>
done. Innocent girls sang the songs and loved the poet,<lb>
while thoughtful women, looking deeper, honored the man.<lb>
Young men received the Essays as brave protests against<lb>
the evils of the times, and old men felt their faith in honor<lb>
and honesty revive. The wise saw great promise in it, and<lb>
the most critical could not deny its beauty and its power.</p>
<p>Early in autumn arrived a fresh delight; and Jessie's<lb>
little daughter became peacemaker as well as idol. Mark<lb>
forgave his enemies, and swore eternal friendship with all<lb>
mankind the first day of his baby's life; and when his sister<lb>
brought, it to him he took both in his arms, making<lb>
atonement for many hasty words and hard thoughts by the<lb>
broken whisper &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two little Sylvias now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wonderful being absorbed both households, from<lb>
grandpapa to the deposed sovereign Tilly, whom Sylvia<lb>
called her own, and kept much with her; while Prue threatened<lb>
to cause a rise in the price of stationery by the daily<lb>
and copious letters full of warning and advice which she<lb>
sent, feeling herself a mother in Israel among her tribe of<lb>
nine, now safely carried through the Red Sea of scarlatina.<lb>
Happy faces made perpetual sunshine round the little Sylvia,<lb>
but to none was she so dear a boon as to her young<lb>
god-mother. Jessie became a trifle jealous of &ldquo;old Sylvia,&rdquo;<lb>
as she now called herself, for she almost lived in baby's<lb>
<pb n="268">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-273">

<figdesc>Page 268.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
nursery; hurrying over in time to assist at its morning<lb>
ablutions, hovering about its crib when it slept, daily discovering<lb>
beauties invisible even to its mother's eyes, and<lb>
working early and late on dainty garments, rich in the embroidery<lb>
which she now thanked Prue for teaching her<lb>
against her will. The touch of the baby hands seemed to<lb>
heal her sore heart; the sound of the baby voice, even<lb>
when most unmusical, had a soothing effect upon her nerves;<lb>
the tender cares its helplessness demanded absorbed her<lb>
thoughts, and kept her happy in a new world whose delights<lb>
she had never known till now.</p>
<p>From this time a restful expression replaced the patient<lb>
hopelessness her face had worn before, and in the lullabys<lb>
she sang the listeners caught echoes of the cheerful voice<lb>
they had never thought to hear again. Gay she was not,<lb>
but serene. Quiet was all she asked; and shunning society<lb>
seemed happiest to sit at home with baby and its gentle<lb>
mother, with Mark, now painting as if inspired, or with her<lb>
father, who relinquished business and devoted himself to<lb>
her. A pleasant pause seemed to have come after troublous<lb>
days; a tranquil hush in which she sat waiting for what<lb>
time should bring her. But as she waited the woman<lb>
seemed to bloom more beautifully than the girl had done.<lb>
Light and color revisited her countenance clearer and deeper<lb>
than of old; fine lines ennobled features faulty in themselves;<lb>
and the indescribable refinement of a deep inward<lb>
life made itself manifest in look, speech, and gesture, giving<lb>
promise of a gracious womanhood.</p>
<p>Mr. Yule augured well from this repose, and believed the<lb>
dawning loveliness to be a herald of returning love. He<lb>
was thinking hopeful thoughts one day as he sat writing to<lb>
Moor, whose faithful correspondent he had become, when<lb>
<pb n="269">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-274">

<figdesc>Page 269.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Sylvia came in with one of the few notes she sent her husband<lb>
while away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time. God bless me, child! what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well might he exclaim, for in his daughter's face he saw<lb>
an expression which caused his hope to suddenly become a<lb>
glad belief. Her lips smiled, though in her eyes there lay<lb>
a shadow which he could not comprehend, and her answer<lb>
did not enlighten him, as she put her arm about his neck<lb>
and laid her slip of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enclose my note, and send the letter; then, father, we<lb>
will talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> a small Italian town not far from Rome, a traveller<lb>
stood listening to an account of a battle lately fought near<lb>
by, in which the town had suffered much, yet been forever<lb>
honored in the eyes of its inhabitants, by having been the<lb>
headquarters of the Hero of Italy. An inquiry of the traveller's<lb>
concerning a countryman of whom he was in search,<lb>
created a sensation at the little inn, and elicited the story<lb>
of the battle, one incident of which was still the all-absorbing<lb>
topic with the excited villagers. This was the incident<lb>
which one of the group related with the dramatic<lb>
effects of a language composed almost as much of gesture<lb>
as of words, and an audience as picturesque as could well<lb>
be conceived.</p>
<p>While the fight was raging on the distant plain, a troop<lb>
of marauding Croats dashed into the town, whose defenders,<lb>
although outnumbered, contested every inch of ground, while<lb>
slowly driven back toward the convent, the despoiling of<lb>
which was the object of the attack. This convent was both<lb>
hospital and refuge, for there were gathered women and<lb>
children, the sick, the wounded, and the old. To secure<lb>
the safety of these rather than of the sacred relics, the<lb>
Italians were bent on holding the town till the reinforcement<lb>
for which they had sent could come up. It was a<lb>
<pb n="271">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-276">

<figdesc>Page 271.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
question of time, and every moment brought nearer the destruction<lb>
of the helpless garrison, trembling behind the<lb>
convent walls. A brutal massacre was in store for them if<lb>
no help came; and remembering this the red-shirted Garibaldians<lb>
fought as if they well deserved their sobriquet of<lb>
&ldquo;Scarlet Demons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Help did come, not from below, but from above. Suddenly<lb>
a cannon thundered royally, and down the narrow<lb>
street rushed a deathful defiance, carrying disorder and<lb>
dismay to the assailants, joy and wonder to the nearly exhausted<lb>
defenders. Wonder, for well they knew the gun<lb>
had stood silent and unmanned since the retreat of the<lb>
enemy two days before, and this unexpected answer to their<lb>
prayers seemed Heaven-sent. Those below looked up as<lb>
they fought, those above looked down as they feared, and<lb>
midway between all saw that a single man held the gun.<lb>
A stalwart figure, bareheaded, stern faced, sinewy armed,<lb>
fitfully seen through clouds of smoke and flashes of fire,<lb>
working with a silent energy that seemed almost superhuman<lb>
to the eyes of the superstitious souls, who believed they<lb>
saw and heard the convent's patron saint proclaiming their<lb>
salvation with a mighty voice.</p>
<p>This belief inspired the Italians, caused a panic among<lb>
the Croats, and saved the town. A few rounds turned the<lb>
scale, the pursued became the pursuers, and when the reinforcement<lb>
arrived there was little for it to do but join in<lb>
the rejoicing and salute the brave cannoneer, who proved to<lb>
be no saint, but a stranger come to watch the battle, and<lb>
thus opportunely lend his aid.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic were the demonstrations; vivas, blessings,<lb>
tears, handkissing, and invocation of all the saints in the<lb>
calendar, till it was discovered that the unknown gentleman<lb>
<pb n="272">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-277">

<figdesc>Page 272.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
had a bullet in his breast and was in need of instant help.<lb>
Whereupon the women, clustering about him like bees, bore<lb>
him away to the wounded ward, where the inmates rose up<lb>
in their beds to welcome him, and the clamorous crowd<lb>
were with difficulty persuaded to relinquish him to the<lb>
priest, the surgeon, and the rest he needed. Nor was this<lb>
all; the crowning glory of the event to the villagers was the<lb>
coming of the Chief at nightfall, and the scene about the<lb>
stranger's bed. Here the narrator glowed with pride, the<lb>
women in the group began to sob, and the men took off<lb>
their caps, with black eyes glittering through their tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellenza, he who had fought for us like a tempest,<lb>
an angel of doom, lay there beside my cousin Beppo, who<lb>
was past help and is now in holy Paradise &mdash; Speranza was<lb>
washing the smoke and powder from him, the wound was<lb>
easy &mdash; death of my soul! may he who gave it die unconfessed!<lb>
See you, I am there, I watch him, the friend of<lb>
Excellenza, the great still man who smiled but said no word<lb>
to us. Then comes the Chief, &mdash; silenzio, till I finish! &mdash; he<lb>
comes, they have told him, he stays at the bed, he looks<lb>
down, the fine eye shines, he takes the hand, he says low &mdash;<lb>
`I thank you,' &mdash; he lays his cloak, &mdash; the gray cloak<lb>
we know and love so well &mdash; over the wounded breast,<lb>
and so goes on. We cry out, but what does the friend?<lb>
Behold! he lifts himself, he lays the cloak upon my Beppo,<lb>
he says in that so broken way of his &mdash; `Comrade, the<lb>
honor is for you who gave your life for him, I give but a<lb>
single hour.' Beppo saw, heard, comprehended; thanked<lb>
him with a glance, and rose up to die crying, `Viva Italia!<lb>
Viva Garibaldi!'</p>
<p>The cry was caught up by all the listeners in a whirlwind<lb>
of enthusiastic loyalty, and the stranger joined in it, thrilled<lb>
<pb n="273">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-278">

<figdesc>Page 273.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with an equal love and honor for the Patriot Soldier, whose<lb>
name upon Italian lips means liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now, this friend of mine, so nearly lost,<lb>
so happily found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen hands pointed to the convent, a dozen brown<lb>
faces lighted up, and a dozen eager voices poured out directions,<lb>
messages, and benedictions in a breath. Ordering his<lb>
carriage to follow presently, the traveller rapidly climbed<lb>
the steep road, guided by signs he could not well mistake.<lb>
The convent gate stood open, and he paused for no permission<lb>
to enter, for looking through it, down the green<lb>
vista of an orchard path, he saw his friend and sprang to<lb>
meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geoffrey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truant that you are, to desert me for ten days, and<lb>
only let me find you when you have no need of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always need you, but am not always needed. I went<lb>
away because the old restlessness came upon me in that<lb>
dead city Rome. You were happy there, but I scented<lb>
war, followed and found it by instinct, and have had enough<lb>
of it. Look at my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed as he showed them, still bruised and blackened<lb>
with the hard usage they had received; nothing else<lb>
but a paler shade of color from loss of blood, showed that<lb>
he had passed through any suffering or danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave hands, I honor them for all their grime. Tell<lb>
me about it, Adam; show me the wound; describe the scene,<lb>
I want to hear it in calm English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Warwick was slow to do so being the hero of the<lb>
tale, and very brief was the reply Moor got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to watch, but found work ready for me. It is<lb>
<pb n="274">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-279">

<figdesc>Page 274.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
not clear to me even now what I did, nor how I did it. One<lb>
of my Berserker rages possessed me I fancy; my nerves<lb>
and muscles seemed made of steel and gutta percha; the<lb>
smell of powder intoxicated, and the sense of power was<lb>
grand. The fire, the smoke, the din were all delicious, and<lb>
I felt like a giant, as I wielded that great weapon, dealing<lb>
many deaths with a single pair of hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The savage in you got the mastery just then; I've seen<lb>
it, and have often wondered how you managed to control it<lb>
so well. Now it has had a holiday and made a hero of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The savage is better out than in, and any man may be<lb>
a hero if he will. What have you been doing since I left<lb>
you poring over pictures in a mouldy palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think to slip away from the subject, do you? and<lb>
after facing death at a cannon's breach expect me to be<lb>
satisfied with an ordinary greeting? I won't have it; I<lb>
insist upon asking as many questions as I like, hearing about<lb>
the wound and seeing if it is doing well. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick showed it, a little purple spot above his heart.<lb>
Moor's face grew anxious as he looked, but cleared again<lb>
as he examined it, for the ball had gone upward and the<lb>
wholesome flesh was already healing fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too near, Adam, but thank God it was no nearer. A<lb>
little lower and I might have looked for you in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This heart of mine is a tough organ, bullet-proof, I dare<lb>
say, though I wear no breastplate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this!&rdquo; Involuntarily Moor's eye asked the question<lb>
his lips did not utter as he touched a worn and faded<lb>
case hanging on the broad breast before him. Silently<lb>
Warwick opened it, showing not Sylvia's face but that of an<lb>
old woman, rudely drawn in sepia; the brown tints bringing<lb>
out the marked features as no softer hue could have<lb>
<pb n="275">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-280">

<figdesc>Page 275.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
done, and giving to each line a depth of expression that<lb>
made the serious countenance singularly lifelike and attractive.<lb>
</p>
<p>Now Moor saw where Warwick got both keen eyes and<lb>
tender mouth, as well as all the gentler traits that softened<lb>
his strong character; and felt that no other woman ever<lb>
had or ever would hold so dear a place as the old mother<lb>
whose likeness he had drawn and hung whre other men<lb>
wear images of mistress or of wife. With a glance as full<lb>
of penitence as the other had been of disquiet, Moor laid<lb>
back the little case, drew bandage and blouse over both<lb>
wound and picture, and linked his arm in Warwick's as he<lb>
asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shot you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell? I knew nothing of it till that flock<lb>
of women fell to kissing these dirty hands of mine; then I<lb>
was conscious of a stinging pain in my shoulder, and a<lb>
warm stream trickling down my side. I looked to see<lb>
what was amiss, whereat the good souls set up a shriek,<lb>
took possession of me, and for half an hour wept and<lb>
wailed over me in a frenzy of emotion and good-will that<lb>
kept me merry in spite of the surgeon's probes and the<lb>
priest's prayers. The appellations showered upon me would<lb>
have startled even your ears, accustomed to soft words.<lb>
Were you ever called `core of my heart,' `sun of my soul,'<lb>
or `cup of gold'?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannonading suits your spirits excellently; I remember<lb>
your telling me that you had tried and liked it. But<lb>
there is to be no more of it, I have other plans for you.<lb>
Before I mention them tell me of the interview with Garibaldi.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That now is a thing to ask one about; a thing to talk<lb>

of and take pride in all one's days. I was half asleep and<lb>
thought myself dreaming till he spoke. A right noble face,<lb>
Geoffrey &mdash; full of thought and power; the look of one<lb>
born to command others because master of himself. A<lb>
square strong frame; no decorations, no parade; dressed<lb>
like his men, yet as much the chief as if he wore a dozen<lb>
orders on his scarlet shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the cloak? I want to see and touch it; surely<lb>
you kept it as a relic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I. Having seen the man, what do I care for the<lb>
garment that covered him. I keep the hand shake, the<lb>
`Grazie, grazie,' for my share. Poor Beppo lies buried in<lb>
the hero's cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grudge it to him, every inch of it, for not having<lb>
seen the man <hi rend="italics">I</hi> do desire the garment. Who but you would<lb>
have done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick smiled, knowing that his friend was well pleased<lb>
with him for all his murmuring. They walked in silence<lb>
till Moor abruptly asked &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can you travel, Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming back to you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it is safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure; ten days is enough to waste upon a scratch<lb>
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, I cannot wait till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. Can you stop till I get my hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't ask me why I am in such haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moor's tone caused Warwick to pause and look at him.<lb>
Joy, impatience, anxiety, contended with each other in his<lb>
countenance; and as if unable to tell the cause himself, he<lb>
put a little paper into the other's hand. Only three words<lb>
were contained in it, but they caused Warwick's face to<lb>
<pb n="277">

<figdesc>Page 277.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="24">
kindle with all the joy betrayed in that of his friend, none<lb>
of the impatience nor anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I say to show you my content? The months<lb>
have seemed very long to you, but now comes the reward.<lb>
The blessed little letter! so like herself; the slender slip,<lb>
the delicate handwriting, the three happy words, &mdash; `Geoffrey,<lb>
come home.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>Moor did not speak, but still looked up anxiously, inquiringly;<lb>
and Warwick answered with a glance he could<lb>
not doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fears for me. I share the joy as heartily as<lb>
I shared the sorrow; neither can separate us any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven for that! But, Adam, may I accept<lb>
this good gift and be sure I am not robbing you again?<lb>
You never speak of the past, how is it with you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite well and happy; the pain is gone, the peace remains.<lb>
I would not leave it otherwise. Six months have<lb>
cured the selfishness of love, and left the satisfaction which<lb>
nothing can change or take away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Sylvia, what of her, Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henceforth, Sylvia and Ottila are only fair illustrations<lb>
of the two extremes of love. I am glad to have known<lb>
both; each has helped me, and each will be remembered<lb>
while I live. But having gained the experience I can<lb>
relinquish the unconscious bestowers of it, if it is not best<lb>
to keep them. Believe that I do this without regret,<lb>
and freely enjoy the happiness that comes to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, but not as I once should; for though I feel that<lb>
you need neither sympathy nor pity, still, I seem to take so<lb>
much and leave you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave me myself, better and humbler than before.<lb>
In the fierce half hour I lived not long ago, I think a great<lb>
<pb n="278">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-283">

<figdesc>Page 278.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and needful change was wrought in me. All lives are full<lb>
of such, coming when least looked for, working out the end<lb>
through unexpected means. The restless, domineering devil<lb>
that haunted me was cast out then; and during the quiet time<lb>
that followed a new spirit entered in and took possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell, yet I welcome it. This peaceful mood<lb>
may not last perhaps, but it brings me that rare moment &mdash;<lb>
pity that it is so rare, and but a moment &mdash; when we seem<lb>
to see temptation at our feet; when we are conscious of a<lb>
willingness to leave all in God's hand, ready for whatever<lb>
He may send; feeling that whether it be suffering or joy<lb>
we shall see the Giver in the gift, and when He calls can<lb>
answer cheerfully `Lord here am I.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>It <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a rare moment, and in it Moor for the first time<lb>
clearly saw the desire and design of his friend's life; saw<lb>
it because it was accomplished, and for the instant Adam<lb>
Warwick was what he aspired to be. A goodly man, whose<lb>
stalwart body seemed a fit home for a strong soul, wise with<lb>
the wisdom of a deep experience, genial with the virtues of<lb>
an upright life, devout with that humble yet valiant piety<lb>
which comes through hard-won victories over &ldquo;the world,<lb>
the flesh, and the devil.&rdquo; Despite the hope that warmed<lb>
his heart, Moor felt poor beside him, as a new reverence<lb>
warmed the old affection. His face showed it though he<lb>
did not speak, and Warwick laid an arm about his shoulders<lb>
as he had often done of late when they were alone, drawing<lb>
him gently on again, as he said, with a touch of playfulness<lb>
to set both at ease &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me your plans, `my cup of gold,' and let me lend<lb>
a hand toward filling you brimful of happiness. You<lb>
are going home?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="279">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-284">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once; you also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you came for me, I stay for you, and Sylvia waits<lb>
for both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says nothing of me in this short, sweet note of<lb>
hers;&rdquo; and Warwick smoothed it carefully in his large<lb>
hand, eyeing it as if he wished there were some little word<lb>
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but in the few letters she has written there always<lb>
comes a message to you, though you never write a<lb>
line; nor would you go to her now had she sent for you<lb>
alone; she knew that, and sends for me, sure that you will<lb>
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being a woman she cannot quite forgive me for loving<lb>
her too well to make her miserable. Dear soul, she will<lb>
never know how much it cost me, but I knew that my only<lb>
safety lay in flight. Tell her so a long while hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall do it yourself, for you are coming home with<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What to do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you ever did; walk up and down the face of the<lb>
earth, waxing in power and virtue, and coming often to us<lb>
when we get fairly back into our former ways, for you are<lb>
still the house friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering, as I walked here, what my next summons<lb>
would be, when lo, you came. Go on, I'll follow<lb>
you; one could hardly have a better guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure you are able, Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I uproot a tree or fling you over the wall to convince<lb>
you, you motherly body? I am nearly whole again,<lb>
and a breath of sea air will complete the cure. Let me cover<lb>
my head, say farewell to the good Sisters, and I shall be<lb>

</eaffig>
glad to slip away without further demonstrations from the<lb>
volcanoes below there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laying one hand on the low wall, Warwick vaulted over<lb>
with a backward glance at Moor, who followed to the gateway,<lb>
there to wait till the adieux were over. Very brief<lb>
they were, and presently Warwick reappeared, evidently<lb>
touched yet ill-pleased at something, for he both smiled and<lb>
frowned as he paused on the threshold as if loth to go. A<lb>
little white goat came skipping from the orchard, and seeing<lb>
the stranger took refuge at Warwick's knee. The act<lb>
of the creature seemed to suggest a thought to the man.<lb>
Pulling off the gay handkerchief some grateful woman had<lb>
knotted round his neck, he fastened it about the goat's,<lb>
having secured something in one end, then rose as if<lb>
content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; called Moor, wondering at this<lb>
arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Widening the narrow entrance into heaven set apart for<lb>
rich men unless they leave their substance behind, as I am<lb>
trying to do. The kind creatures cannot refuse it now; so<lb>
trot away to your mistress, little Nanna, and tell no tales<lb>
as you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the goat went tapping up the steps a stir within announced<lb>
the dreaded demonstration. Warwick did not<lb>
seem to hear it; he stood looking far across the trampled<lb>
plain and ruined town toward the mountains shining white<lb>
against the deep Italian sky. A rapt, far-reaching look, as<lb>
if he saw beyond the purple wall, and seeing forgot the<lb>
present in some vision of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Adam! I am waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eye came back, the lost look passed, and cheerily he<lb>
answered &mdash;</p>
<pb n="281">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-286">

<figdesc>Page 281.</figdesc>

</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="24 *">
<p>&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fortnight later in that dark hour before the dawn,<lb>
with a murky sky above them, a hungry sea below them,<lb>
the two stood together the last to leave a sinking ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room for one more, choose quick!&rdquo; shouted a hoarse<lb>
voice from the boat tossing underneath, freighted to the<lb>
water's edge with trembling lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Geoffrey, Sylvia is waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without you, Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are exhausted; I can bear a rough hour better<lb>
than yourself, and morning will bring help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not. Go, I am the lesser loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What folly! I will force you to it; steady there, he<lb>
is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push off, I am <hi rend="italics">not</hi> coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In times like that, few pause for pity or persuasion; the<lb>
instinct of self-preservation rules supreme, and each is for<lb>
himself, except those in whom love of another is stronger<lb>
than love of life. Even while the friends gencrously contended<lb>
the boat was swept away, and they were left alone<lb>
in the deserted ship, swiftly making its last voyage downward.<lb>
Spent with a day of intense excitement, and sick<lb>
with hope deferred, Moor leaned on Warwick, feeling that<lb>
it was adding bitterness to death to die in sight of shore.<lb>
But Warwick never knew despair; passive submission was<lb>
not in his power while anything remained to do or dare,<lb>
and even then he did not cease to hope. It was certain<lb>
death to linger there; other boats less heavily laden had<lb>
put off before, and might drift across their track; wreckers<lb>
waiting on the shore might hear and help; at least it were<lb>
better to die bravely and not &ldquo;strike sail to a fear.&rdquo; About<lb>
his waist still hung a fragment of the rope which had<lb>
<pb n="282">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-287">

<figdesc>Page 282.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
lowered more than one baby to its mother's arms; before them<lb>
the shattered taffrail rose and fell as the waves beat over it.<lb>
Wrenching a spar away he lashed Moor to it, explaining his<lb>
purpose as he worked. There was only rope enough for<lb>
one, and in the darkness Moor believed that Warwick had<lb>
taken equal precautions for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Geoffrey your hand, and when the next wave<lb>
ebbs let us follow it. If we are parted and you see her<lb>
first tell her I remembered, and give her this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the black night with only Heaven to see them the<lb>
men kissed tenderly as women, then hand in hand sprang<lb>
out into the sea. Drenched and blinded they struggled up<lb>
after the first plunge, and struck out for the shore, guided<lb>
by the thunder of the surf they had listened to for twelve<lb>
long hours, as it broke against the beach, and brought no<lb>
help on its receding billows. Soon Warwick was the only<lb>
one who struggled, for Moor's strength was gone, and he<lb>
clung half conscious to the spar, tossing from wave to wave,<lb>
a piteous plaything for the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a light! &mdash; they must take you in &mdash; hold fast,<lb>
I'll save you for the little wife at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moor heard but two words, &ldquo;wife&rdquo; and &ldquo;home;&rdquo; strained<lb>
his dim eyes to see the light, spent his last grain of<lb>
strength to reach it, and in the act lost consciousness, whispering&mdash;<lb>
&ldquo;She will thank you,&rdquo; as his head fell against<lb>
Warwick's breast and lay there, heavy and still. Lifting<lb>
himself above the spar, Adam lent the full power of his<lb>
voice to the shout he sent ringing through the storm. He<lb>
did not call in vain, a friendly wind took the cry to human<lb>
ears, a relenting wave swept them within the reach of human<lb>
aid, and the boat's crew, pausing involuntarily, saw a<lb>
hand clutch the suspended oar, a face flash up from the<lb>
<pb n="283">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-288">

<figdesc>Page 283.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
black water, and heard a breathless voice issue the command&mdash;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take in this man! he saved you for your wives, save<lb>
him for his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One resolute will can sway a panic-stricken multitude;<lb>
it did so then. The boat was rocking in the long swell of<lb>
the sea; a moment and the coming wave would sweep them<lb>
far apart. A woman sobbed, and as if moved by one impulse<lb>
four sturdy arms clutched and drew Moor in. While<lb>
loosening his friend Warwick had forgotten himself, and<lb>
the spar was gone. He knew it, but the rest believed that<lb>
they left the strong man a chance of life equal to their own<lb>
in that overladen boat. Yet in the memories of all who<lb>
caught that last glimpse of him there long remained the<lb>
recollection of a dauntless face floating out into the night,<lb>
a steady voice calling through the gale, &ldquo;A good voyage,<lb>
comrades!&rdquo; as he turned away to enter port before them.</p>
<p>Wide was the sea and pitiless the storm, but neither<lb>
could dismay the unconquerable spirit of the man who<lb>
fought against the elements as bravely as if they were adversaries<lb>
of mortal mould, and might be vanquished in the<lb>
end. But it was not to be; soon he felt it, accepted it,<lb>
turned his face upward toward the sky, where one star<lb>
shone, and when Death whispered &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; answered as<lb>
cheerily as to that other friend, &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo; Then with<lb>
a parting thought for the man he had saved, the woman<lb>
he had loved, the promise he had kept, a great and tender<lb>
heart went down into the sea.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Sculptor, whose workshop is the world,<lb>
fuses many metals and casts a noble statue; leaves it for<lb>
humanity to criticise, and when time has mellowed both<lb>

beauties and blemishes, removes it to that inner studio,<lb>
there to be carved in enduring marble.</p>
<p>Adam Warwick was such an one; with much alloy and<lb>
many flaws; but beneath all defects the Master's eye saw the<lb>
grand lines that were to serve as models for the perfect man,<lb>
and when the design had passed through all necessary processes, &mdash;<lb>
the mould of clay, the furnace fire, the test of<lb>
time, &mdash; He washed the dust away, and pronounced it ready<lb>
for the marble.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">They</hi> had been together for an hour, the husband and<lb>
the wife. The first excitement was now over, and Sylvia<lb>
stood behind him tearless and tranquil, while Moor, looking<lb>
like a man out of whom the sea had drenched both strength<lb>
and spirit, leaned his weary head against her, trying to<lb>
accept the great loss, enjoy the great gain which had befallen<lb>
him. Hitherto all their talk had been of Warwick,<lb>
and as Moor concluded the history of the months so tragically<lb>
ended, for the first time he ventured to express wonder<lb>
at the calmness with which his hearer received the sad<lb>
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How quietly you listen to words which it wrings my<lb>
heart to utter. Have you wept your tears dry, or do you<lb>
still cling to hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I feel that we shall never see him any more; but<lb>
I have no desire to weep, for tears and lamentations do not<lb>
belong to him. He died a beautiful, a noble death; the<lb>
sea is a fitting grave for him, and it is pleasant to think of<lb>
him asleep there, quiet at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot feel so; I find it hard to think of him as dead;<lb>
he was so full of life, so fit to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And therefore fit to die. Imagine him as I do, enjoying<lb>
the larger life he longed for, and growing to be the<lb>

</eaffig>
strong, sweet soul whose foreshadowing we saw and loved<lb>
so here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, I have told you of the beautiful change which<lb>
befell him in those last days, and now I see the same in<lb>
you. Are you, too, about to leave me when I have just<lb>
recovered you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stay with you all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Adam was less to you than you believed, and I<lb>
am more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is changed. Adam is all he ever was to me,<lb>
you are all you ever can be; but I &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why send for me? Why say you will stay with<lb>
me all your life? Sylvia, for God's sake, let there be no<lb>
more delusion or deceit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never again! I will tell you; I meant to do it at<lb>
once, but it is so hard &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her face away, and for a moment neither<lb>
stirred. Then drawing his head to its former resting-place<lb>
she touched it very tenderly, seeing how many white threads<lb>
shone among the brown; and as her hand went to and fro<lb>
with an inexpressibly soothing gesture, she said, in a tone<lb>
whose quietude controlled his agitation like a spell &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago, in my great trouble, Faith told me that for<lb>
every human effort or affliction there were two friendly<lb>
helpers, Time and Death. The first has taught me more<lb>
gently than I deserved; has made me humble, and given<lb>
me hope that through my errors I may draw virtue from<lb>
repentance. But while I have been learning the lessons<lb>
time can teach, that other helper has told me to be ready<lb>
for its coming. Geoffrey, I sent for you because I knew<lb>
you would love to see me again before we must say the long<lb>
good by.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="287">

<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-292">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sylvia! not that; anything but that. I cannot<lb>
bear it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear heart, be patient; lean on me, and let me help<lb>
you bear it, for it is inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall not be! There must be some help, some hope.<lb>
God would not be so pitiless as to take both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not leave you yet. He does not take me; it is<lb>
I, who, by wasting life, have lost the right to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it so? I cannot make it true. You look so<lb>
beautiful, so blooming, and the future seemed so sure.<lb>
Sylvia, show it to me, if it must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only turned her face to him, only held up her transparent<lb>
hand, and let him read the heavy truth. He did<lb>
so, for now he saw that the beauty and the bloom were<lb>
transitory as the glow of leaves that frost makes fairest as<lb>
they fall, and felt the full significance of the great change<lb>
which had come. He clung to her with a desperate yet<lb>
despairing hold, and she could only let the first passion of<lb>
his grief have way, soothing and sustaining, while her heart<lb>
bled and the draught was very bitter to her lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, love; be quiet for a little; and when you can<lb>
bear it better, I will tell you how it is with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me now; let me hear everything at once. When<lb>
did you know? How are you sure? Why keep it from<lb>
me all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only known it for a little while, but I am very<lb>
sure, and I kept it from you that you might come happily<lb>
home, for knowledge of it would have lengthened every<lb>
mile, and made the journey one long anxiety. I could not<lb>
know that Adam would go first, and so make my task<lb>
doubly hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me, Sylvia; let me keep you while I may. I<lb>

will not be violent; I will listen patiently, and through<lb>
everything remember you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did remember her, so thoughtfully, so tenderly, that<lb>
her little story flowed on uninterrupted by sigh or sob; and<lb>
while he held his grief in check, the balm of submission<lb>
comforted his sore heart. Sitting by him, sustaining and<lb>
sustained, she told the history of the last six months, till<lb>
just before the sending of the letter. She paused there a<lb>
moment, then hurried on, gradually losing the consciousness<lb>
of present emotion in the vivid memory of the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no faith in dreams; I have; and to a dream<lb>
I owe my sudden awakening to the truth. Thank and respect<lb>
it, for without its warning I might have remained in<lb>
ignorance of my state until it was too late to find and<lb>
bring you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless the dream and keep the dreamer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a strange and solemn vision; one to remember<lb>
and to love for its beautiful interpretation of the prophecy<lb>
that used to awe and sadden me, but never can again.<lb>
I dreamed that the last day of the world had come. I<lb>
stood on a shadowy house-top in a shadowy city, and all<lb>
around me far as eye could reach thronged myriads of people,<lb>
till the earth seemed white with human faces. All were<lb>
mute and motionless, as if fixed in a trance of expectation,<lb>
for none knew how the end would come. Utter silence<lb>
filled the world, and across the sky a vast curtain of the<lb>
blackest cloud was falling, blotting out face after face and<lb>
leaving the world a blank. In that universal gloom and<lb>
stillness, far above me in the heavens I saw the pale outlines<lb>
of a word stretching from horizon to horizon. Letter<lb>
after letter came out full and clear, till all across the sky,<lb>

the great word A men. As the last letter reached its bright<lb>
perfection, a long waft of wind broke over me like a universal<lb>
sigh of hope from human hearts. For far away on<lb>
the horizon's edge all saw a line of light that widened<lb>
as they looked, and through that rift, between the dark<lb>
earth and the darker sky, rolled in a softly flowing sea.<lb>
Wave after wave came on, so wide, so cool, so still. None<lb>
trembled at their approach, none shrunk from their embrace,<lb>
but all turned toward that ocean with a mighty rush, all<lb>
faces glowed in its splendor, and million after million vanished<lb>
with longing eyes fixed on the arch of light through<lb>
which the ebbing sea would float them when its work was<lb>
done. I felt no fear, only the deepest awe, for I seemed<lb>
such an infinitesimal atom of the countless host that I forgot<lb>
myself. Nearer and nearer came the flood, till its breath<lb>
blew on my cheeks, and I, too, leaned to meet it, longing<lb>
to be taken. A great wave rolled up before me, and through<lb>
its soft glimmer I saw a beautiful, benignant face regarding<lb>
me. Then I knew that each and all had seen the same,<lb>
and losing fear in love were glad to go. The joyful yearning<lb>
woke me as the wave seemed to break at my feet, and<lb>
ebbing leave me still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all? Only a dream, a foreboding fancy,<lb>
Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I woke my hair was damp on my forehead, my<lb>
breath quite still, my heart so cold I felt as if death had<lb>
indeed been near me and left its chill behind. So strong<lb>
was the impression of the dream, so perfect was the similitude<lb>
between the sensations I had experienced then, and<lb>
more than once awake, that I felt that something was seriously<lb>
wrong with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had been ill then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not consciously, not suffering any pain, but consumed<lb>
with an inward fever that would not burn itself away.<lb>
I used to have a touch of it in the evenings, you remember;<lb>
but now it burned all day, making me look strong and rosy,<lb>
yet leaving me so worn out at night that no sleep seemed<lb>
to restore me. A few weak and weary hours, then the fire<lb>
was rekindled and the false strength, color, spirits, returned<lb>
to deceive myself, and those about me, for another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell no one of this, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at first, because I fancied it a mental ill. I had<lb>
thought so much, so deeply, it seemed but natural that I<lb>
should be tired. I tried to rest myself by laying all my<lb>
cares and sorrows in God's hand, and waiting patiently to<lb>
be shown the end. I see it now, but for a time I could<lb>
only sit and wait; and while I did so my soul grew strong<lb>
but my ill-used body failed. The dream came, and in the<lb>
stillness of that night I felt a strange assurance that I<lb>
should see my mother soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I determined to discover if I had deceived myself with<lb>
a superstitious fancy, or learned a fateful fact in my own<lb>
mysterious way. If it were false, no one would be made<lb>
anxious by it; if true, prossessing the first knowledge of it<lb>
would enable me to comfort others. I went privately to<lb>
town and consulted the famous physician who has grown<lb>
gray in the study of disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go alone, Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, alone. I am braver than I used to be, and have<lb>
learned never to feel quite alone. I found a grave, stern-looking<lb>
man; I told him that I wished to know the entire<lb>
truth whatever it might be, and that he need not fear to<lb>
tell me because I was prepared for it. He asked many<lb>
<pb n="291">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-296">

<figdesc>Page 291.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
questions, thought a little, and was very slow to speak.<lb>
Then I saw how it would be, but urged him to set my mind<lb>
at rest. His stern old face grew very pitiful as he took my<lb>
hand and answered gently &mdash; &ldquo;My child, go home and prepare<lb>
to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God, how cruel! Sylvia, how did you bear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first the earth seemed to slip away from under me,<lb>
and time to stand still. Then I was myself again, and could<lb>
listen steadily to all he said. It was only this, &mdash; I had<lb>
been born with a strong nature in a feeble frame, had lived<lb>
too fast, wasted health ignorantly, and was past help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he do nothing for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but tell me how to husband my remaining<lb>
strength, and make the end easy by the care that would<lb>
have kept me longer had I known this sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no one saw your danger; no one warned you of it;<lb>
and I was away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father could not see it, for I looked well and tried to<lb>
think I felt so. Mark and Jessie were absorbed in baby<lb>
Sylvia, and Prue was gone. You might have seen and<lb>
helped me, for you have the intuitions of a woman in many<lb>
things, but I could not send for you then because I could<lb>
not give you what you asked. Was it wrong to call you<lb>
when I did, and try to make the hard fact easier to bear by<lb>
telling it myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless you for it, Sylvia. It was truly generous<lb>
and kind. I never could have forgiven you had you denied<lb>
me the happiness of seeing you again, and you have robbed<lb>
the truth of half its bitter pain by telling it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A restful expression came into her face, and a sigh of<lb>
satisfaction proved how great was the relief of feeling that<lb>
for once her heart had prompted her aright. Moor let her<lb>

</eaffig>
rest a little, then asked with a look more pathetic than his<lb>
words &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to you now? Where is my home to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend forever, no more, no less; and your home is<lb>
here with us until I leave my father to your care. All this<lb>
pain and separation were in vain if we have not learned<lb>
that love can neither be forced nor feigned. While I endeavored<lb>
to do so, God did not help me, and I went deeper<lb>
and deeper into sorrow and wrong doing. When I dropped<lb>
all self-delusion and desperate striving, and stood still,<lb>
asking to be shown the right, then he put out his hand and<lb>
through much tribulation led me to convictions that I dare<lb>
not disobey. Our friendship may be a happy one if we<lb>
accept and use it as we should. Let it be so, and for the<lb>
little while that I remain, let us live honestly before heaven<lb>
and take no thought for the world's opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adam might have owned the glance she bent upon her<lb>
husband, so clear, so steadfast was it; but the earnestness<lb>
was all her own, and blended with it a new strength<lb>
that seemed a late compensation for lost love and waning<lb>
life. Remembering the price both had paid for it, Moor<lb>
gratefully accepted the costly friendship offered him, and<lb>
soon acknowledged both its beauty and its worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question more; Sylvia, how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very hard to answer, but folding the sharp fact<lb>
in the gentlest fancy that appeared to her she gave him the<lb>
whole truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not see the spring again, but it will be a pleasant<lb>
time to lay me underneath the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia had not known how to live, but now she proved<lb>
that she did know how to die. So beautifully were the two<lb>
made one, the winning girl, the deep-hearted woman, that<lb>
<pb n="293">

<figdesc>Page 293.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="25 *">
she seemed the same beloved Sylvia, yet Sylvia strengthened,<lb>
purified, and perfected by the hard past, the solemn<lb>
present. Those about her felt and owned the unconscious<lb>
power, which we call the influence of character, and which<lb>
is the noblest that gives sovereignty to man or woman.</p>
<p>So cheerfully did she speak of it, so tranquilly did she<lb>
prepare to meet it, that death soon ceased to be an image of<lb>
grief or fear to those about her, and became a benignant<lb>
friend, who, when the mortal wearies, blesses it with a brief<lb>
slecp, that it may wake immortal. She would have no sad,<lb>
sick-chamber, no mournful faces, no cessation of the wholesome<lb>
household cares and joys, that do so much to make<lb>
hearts strong and spirits happy. While strength remained,<lb>
she went her round of daily duties, doing each so lovingly,<lb>
that the most trivial became a delight, and taking unsuspected<lb>
thought for the comfort or the pleasure of those soon<lb>
to be left behind, so tenderly, that she could not seem lost to<lb>
them, even when she was gone.</p>
<p>Faith came to her, and as her hands became too weak for<lb>
anything but patient folding, every care slipped so quietly<lb>
into Faith's, that few perceived how fast she was laying<lb>
down the things of this world, and making ready to take<lb>
up those of the world to come. Her father was her<lb>
faithful shadow; bent and white-haired now, but growing<lb>
young at heart in spite of sorrow, for his daughter had in<lb>
truth become the blessing of his life. Mark and Jessie<lb>
brought their offering of love in little Sylvia's shape, and<lb>
the innocent consoler did her sweet work by making sunshine<lb>
in a shady place. But Moor was all in all to Sylvia,<lb>
and their friendship proved an abiding strength, for sorrow<lb>
made it very tender, sincerity ennobled it, and the coming<lb>
change sanctified it to them both.</p>

<p>April came; and on her birthday, with a grateful heart,<lb>
Moor gathered the first snow-drops of the year. All day<lb>
they stood beside her couch, as fragile and as pale as she,<lb>
and many eyes had filled as loving fancies likened her to<lb>
the slender, transparent vase, the very spirit of a shape,<lb>
and the white flowers that had blossomed beautifully through<lb>
the snow. When the evening lamp was lighted, she took<lb>
the little posy in her hand, and lay with her eyes upon it,<lb>
listening to the book Moor read, for this hour always soothed<lb>
the unrest of the day. Very quiet was the pleasant room,<lb>
with no sounds in it but the soft flicker of the fire, the rustle<lb>
of Faith's needle, and the subdued music of the voice<lb>
that patiently went reading on, long after Sylvia's eyes had<lb>
closed, lest she should miss its murmur. For an hour she<lb>
seemed to sleep, so motionless, so colorless, that her father,<lb>
always sitting at her side, bent down at last to listen at her<lb>
lips. The lips smiled, the eyes unclosed, and she looked up<lb>
at him, with an expression as tender as tranquil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long sleep and pleasant dreams that wake you smiling?&rdquo;<lb>
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful and happy thoughts, father; let me tell you<lb>
some of them. As I lay here, I fell to thinking of my life,<lb>
and at first it seemed the sorrowfullest failure I had ever<lb>
known. Whom had I made happy? What had I done<lb>
worth the doing? Where was the humble satisfaction that<lb>
should come hand in hand with death? At first I could<lb>
find no answers to my questions, and though my one and<lb>
twenty years do not seem long to live, I felt as if it would<lb>
have been better for us all if I had died, a new-born baby<lb>
in my mother's arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child say anything, but that, because it is I who<lb>
have made your life a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="295">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-300">

<figdesc>Page 295.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a little father, and you will see that it is a beautiful<lb>
success. I <hi rend="italics">have</hi> given happiness, <hi rend="italics">have</hi> done something<lb>
worth the doing; now I see a compensation for all seeming<lb>
loss, and heartily thank God that I did not die till I had<lb>
learned the true purpose of all lives. He knows that I say<lb>
these things humbly, that I claim no virtue for myself, and<lb>
have been a blind instrument in His hand, to illustrate<lb>
truths that will endure when I am forgotten. I have helped<lb>
Mark and Jessie, for, remembering me, they will feel<lb>
how blest they are in truly loving one another. They will<lb>
keep little Sylvia from making mistakes like mine, and the<lb>
household joys and sorrows we have known together, will<lb>
teach Mark to make his talent a delight to many, by letting<lb>
art interpret nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother standing behind her stooped and kissed her,<lb>
saying through his tears &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall remember, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have helped Geoffrey, I believe. He lived too much<lb>
in the affections, till through me he learned that none may<lb>
live for love alone. Genius will be born of grief, and<lb>
he will put his sorrow into song to touch and teach other<lb>
hearts more gently than his own has been, so growing a<lb>
nobler and a richer man for the great cross of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calm, with the calmness of a grief too deep for tears, and<lb>
strong in a devout belief, Moor gave his testimony as she<lb>
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall endeavor, and now I am as grateful for the pain<lb>
as for the joy, because together they will show me how to<lb>
live, and when I have learned that I shall be ready to come<lb>
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have served Adam. He needed gentleness<lb>
as Geoffrey needed strength, and I, unworthy as I am, woke<lb>
<pb n="296">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-301">

</eaffig>
that deep heart of his and made it a fitter mate for his<lb>
great soul. To us it seems as if he had left his work unfinished,<lb>
but God knew best, and when he was needed for a<lb>
better work he went to find it. Yet I am sure that he was<lb>
worthier of eternal life for having known the discipline of<lb>
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no voice to answer now, but Sylvia felt that<lb>
she would receive it very soon and was content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no lesson for your father? The old man<lb>
needs it most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her thin hand tenderly on his, that if her words<lb>
should bring reproach, she might seem to share it with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, this. That if the chief desire of the heart<lb>
is for the right, it is possible for any human being, through<lb>
all trials, temptations, and mistakes, to bring good out of<lb>
evil, hope from despair, success from defeat, and come at<lb>
last to know an hour as beautiful and blest as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could doubt that <hi rend="italics">she</hi> had learned the lesson, when<lb>
from the ruins of the perishable body the imperishable soul<lb>
rose steadfast and serene, proving that after the long bewilderment<lb>
of life and love it had attained the eternal<lb>
peace.</p>
<p>The room grew very still, and while those about her pondered<lb>
her words with natural tears, Sylvia lay looking up<lb>
at a lovely picture that seemed leaning down to offer her<lb>
again the happiest memory of her youth. It was a painting<lb>
of the moonlight voyage down the river. Mark had given it<lb>
that day, and now when the longer, sadder voyage was<lb>
nearly over, she regarded it with a tender pleasure. The<lb>
moon shone full on Warwick, looking out straight and<lb>
strong before him with the vigilant expression native to his<lb>
face; a fit helmsman to guide the boat along that rapid<lb>
<pb n="297">
<eaffig volid="eaf443T" entity="f443-302">

<figdesc>Page 297.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stream. Mark seemed pausing to watch the oars silvered<lb>
by the light, and their reflections wavy with the current.<lb>
Moor, seen in shadow, leaned upon his hand, as if watching<lb>
Sylvia, a quiet figure, full of grace and color, couched<lb>
under the green arch. On either hand the summer woods<lb>
made vernal gloom, behind the cliffs rose sharply up against<lb>
the blue, and all before wound a shining road, along which<lb>
the boat seemed floating like a bird on slender wings between<lb>
two skies.</p>
<p>So long she lay forgetful of herself and all about her,<lb>
that Moor saw she needed rest, for the breath fluttered on<lb>
her lips, the flowers had fallen one by one, and her face<lb>
wore the weary yet happy look of some patient child waiting<lb>
for its lullaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, you have talked enough; let me take you up<lb>
now, lest the pleasant day be spoiled by a sleepless night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready, yet I love to stay among you all, for in my<lb>
sleep I seem to drift so far away I never quite come back.<lb>
Good night, good night; I shall see you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, a kiss for all, they saw her fold her arms<lb>
about her husband's neck, and lay down her head as if she<lb>
never cared to lift it up again. The little journey was<lb>
both a pleasure and pain to them, for each night the way<lb>
seemed longer to Sylvia, and though the burden lightened<lb>
the bearer grew more heavy-hearted. It was a silent passage<lb>
now, for neither spoke, except when one asked tenderly,<lb>
&ldquo;Are you easy, love?&rdquo; and the other answered, with a<lb>
breath that chilled his check, &ldquo;Quite happy, quite content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, cradled on the heart that loved her best, Sylvia was<lb>
gently carried to the end of her short pilgrimage, and<lb>
when her husband laid her down the morning had already<lb>
dawned.</p>

outer-most border consists of a dark line forming a rectangle.  This
rectangular area contains an ornate filigree pattern and three heraldic
shields, in a line next to one another, along the bottom of that
patterned, rectangular area.  The top of each shield is tilted to the
left.  The shield on the left has two crowns on the top, an open book in
the center, and one crown on the bottom.  The shield in the center has
an image of an open right hand within a smaller shield in the middle,
surrounded by a chevron above and below it; six birds of the same type
appear on the shield, with three along the top, two between the chevrons
and on either side of the open hand, and one on the bottom.  The shield
on the right has a circular seal, which appears to include the image of
a globe and a motto.  The patterned, rectangular area also encloses a

<p>WHAT air you thinkin' of, Phil?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I! Aint it odd how fellers fall to thinkin' of<lb>
thar little women, when they get a quiet spell like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunate for us that we do get it, and have such gentle<lb>
bosom guests to keep us brave and honest through the trials<lb>
and temptations of a life like ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>October moonlight shone clearly on the solitary tree, draped<lb>
with gray moss, scarred by lightning and warped by wind,<lb>
looking like a venerable warrior, whose long campaign was<lb>
nearly done; and underneath was posted the guard of four.<lb>
Behind them twinkled many camp-fires on a distant plain,<lb>
before them wound a road ploughed by the passage of an<lb>
army, strewn with the relics of a rout. On the right, a sluggish<lb>
river glided, like a serpent, stealthy, sinuous, and dark,<lb>
into a seemingly impervious jungle; on the left, a Southern<lb>
swamp filled the air with malarial damps, swarms of noisome<lb>
life, and discordant sounds that robbed the hour of its repose.<lb>
The men were friends as well as comrades, for though gathered<lb>
from the four quarters of the Union, and dissimilar in<lb>
education, character, and tastes, the same spirit animated all;<lb>
the routine of camp life threw them much together, and<lb>
mutual esteem soon grew into a bond of mutual good fellowship.<lb>

<p>Thorn was a Massachusetts volunteer; a man who seemed<lb>
too early old, too early embittered by some cross, for though<lb>
grim of countenance, rough of speech, cold of manner, a keen<lb>
observer would have soon discovered traces of a deeper,<lb>
warmer nature hidden behind the repellent front he turned<lb>
upon the world. A true New Englander, thoughtful, acute,<lb>
reticent, and opinionated; yet earnest withal, intensely patriotic,<lb>
and often humorous, despite a touch of Puritan austerity</p>
<p>Phil, the &ldquo;romantic chap,&rdquo; as he was called, looked his<lb>
character to the life. Slender, swarthy, melancholy eyed,<lb>
and darkly bearded; with feminine features, mellow voice,<lb>
and alternately languid or vivacious manners. A child of<lb>
the South in nature as in aspect, ardent, impressible, and<lb>
proud; fitfully aspiring and despairing; without the native<lb>
energy which moulds character and ennobles life. Months<lb>
of discipline and devotion had done much for him, and some<lb>
deep experience was fast ripening the youth into a man.</p>
<p>Flint, the long-limbed lumberman, from the wilds of<lb>
Maine, was a conscript who, when government demanded his<lb>
money or his life, calculated the cost, and decided that the<lb>
cash would be a dead loss and the claim might be repeated,<lb>
whereas the conscript would get both pay and plunder out<lb>
of government, while taking excellent care that government<lb>
got precious little out of him. A shrewd, slow-spoken,<lb>
self-reliant specimen, was Flint; yet something of the fresh<lb>
flavor of the backwoods lingered in him still, as if Nature<lb>
were loath to give him up, and left the mark of her motherly<lb>
hand upon him, as she leaves it in a dry, pale lichen, on the<lb>
bosom of the roughest stone.</p>
<p>Dick &ldquo;hailed&rdquo; from Illinois, and was a comely young fellow,<lb>
full of dash and daring; rough and rowdy, generous<lb>
and jolly, overflowing with spirits and ready for a free fight<lb>
with all the world.</p>

<p>Silence followed the last words, while the friendly moon<lb>
climbed up the sky. Each man's eye followed it, and each<lb>
man's heart was busy with remembrances of other eyes and<lb>
hearts that might be watching and wishing as theirs watched<lb>
and wished. In the silence, each shaped for himself that<lb>
vision of home that brightens so many camp-fires, haunts<lb>
so many dreamers under canvas roofs, and keeps so many<lb>
turbulent natures tender by memories which often are both<lb>
solace and salvation.</p>
<p>Thorn paced to and fro, his rifle on his shoulder, vigilant<lb>
and soldierly, however soft his heart might be. Phil leaned<lb>
against the tree, one hand in the breast of his blue jacket, on<lb>
the painted presentment of the face his fancy was picturing<lb>
in the golden circle of the moon. Flint lounged on the<lb>
sward, whistling softly as he whittled at a fallen bough.<lb>
Dick was flat on his back, heels in air, cigar in mouth, and<lb>
some hilarious notion in his mind, for suddenly he broke into<lb>
a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, lad?&rdquo; asked Thorn, pausing in his tramp,<lb>
as if willing to be drawn from the disturbing thought that<lb>
made his black brows lower and his mouth look grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinkin' of my wife, and wishin' she was here, bless her<lb>
heart! set me rememberin' how I see her fust, and so I<lb>
roared, as I always do when it comes into my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it? Come, reel off a yarn and let's hear houw<lb>
yeou hitched teams,&rdquo; said Flint, always glad to get information<lb>
concerning his neighbors, if it could be cheaply done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tellin' how we found our wives wouldn't be a bad game,<lb>
would it, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm agreeable; but let us have your romance first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devilish little of that about me or any of my doin's. I<lb>
hate sentimental bosh as much as you hate slang, and should<lb>
have been a bachelor to this day if I hadn't seen Kitty jest<lb>
<pb n="006">

as I did. You see, I'd been too busy larkin' round to get<lb>
time for marryin', till a couple of years ago, when I did up<lb>
the job double-quick, as I'd like to do this thunderin' slow<lb>
one, hang it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt a minute till I give a look, for this picket isn't<lb>
going to be driven in or taken while I'm on guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down his beat went Thorn, reconnoitring river, road, and<lb>
swamp, as thoroughly as one pair of keen eyes could do it,<lb>
and came back satisfied, but still growling like a faithful mastiff<lb>
on the watch; performances which he repeated at intervals<lb>
till his own turn came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't have to go out of my own State for a wife,<lb>
you'd better believe,&rdquo; began Dick, with a boast, as usual;<lb>
&ldquo;for we raise as fine a crop of girls thar as any State in or<lb>
out of the Union, and don't mind raisin' Cain with any man<lb>
who denies it. I was out on a gunnin' tramp with Joe Partridge,<lb>
a cousin of mine, &mdash; poor old chap! he fired his last<lb>
shot at Gettysburg, and died game in a way he didn't dream<lb>
of the day we popped off the birds together. It ain't right<lb>
to joke that way; I won't if I can help it; but a feller gets<lb>
awfully kind of heathenish these times, don't he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settle up them scores byme-by; fightin' Christians is<lb>
scurse raound here. Fire away, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got as hungry as hounds half a dozen mile<lb>
from home, and when a farm-house hove in sight, Joe said<lb>
he'd ask for a bite and leave some of the plunder for pay. I<lb>
was visitin' Joe, didn't know folks round, and backed out of<lb>
the beggin' part of the job; so he went ahead alone. We'd<lb>
come up the woods behind the house, and while Joe was<lb>
foragin', I took are connoissance. The view was fust-rate,<lb>
for the main part of it was a girl airin' beds on the roof of a<lb>
stoop. Now, jest about that time, havin' a leisure spell, I'd<lb>
begun to think of marryin', and took a look at all the girls I<lb>
<pb n="007">

met, with an eye to business. I s'pose every man has some<lb>
sort of an idee or pattern of the wife he wants; pretty and<lb>
plucky, good and gay was mine, but I'd never found it till<lb>
I see Kitty; and as she didn't see me, I had the advantage<lb>
and took an extra long stare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was her good pints, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, she had a wide-awake pair of eyes, a bright,<lb>
jolly sort of a face, lots of curly hair tumblin' out of her net,<lb>
a trig little figger, and a pair of the neatest feet and ankles that<lb>
ever stepped. `Pretty,' thinks I; `so far so good.' The way<lb>
she whacked the pillers, shooked the blankets, and pitched into<lb>
the beds was a caution; specially one blunderin' old featherbed<lb>
that wouldn't do nothin' but sag round in a pig-headed<lb>
sort of way, that would have made most girls get mad and give<lb>
up. Kitty didn't, but just wrastled with it like a good one, till<lb>
she got it turned, banged, and spread to suit her; then she<lb>
plumped down in the middle of it, with a sarcy little nod and<lb>
chuckle to herself, that tickled me mightily. `Plucky,'<lb>
thinks I, `better 'n' better.' Jest then an old woman came<lb>
flyin' out the back-door, callin', `Kitty! Kitty! Squire Partridge's<lb>
son's here, 'long with a friend; been gunnin', want<lb>
luncheon, and I'm all in the suds; do come down and see to'<lb>
em.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Where are they?' says Kitty, scrambling up her hair<lb>
and settlin' her gown in a jiffy, as women have a knack of<lb>
doin', you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Mr. Joe's in the front entry; the other man's somewheres<lb>
round, Billy says, waitin' till I send word whether<lb>
they can stop. I darsn't till I'd seen you, for I can't do<lb>
nothin', I'm in such a mess,' says the old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`So am I, for I can't get in except by the the entry window,<lb>
and he'll see me,' says Kitty, gigglin' at the thoughts of<lb>
Joe.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Come down the ladder, there's a dear. I'll pull it<lb>
round and keep it stiddy,' says her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Oh, ma, don't ask me!' says Kitty, with a shiver.<lb>
`I'm dreadfully scared of ladders since I broke my arm off<lb>
this very one. It's so high, it makes me dizzy jest to<lb>
think of.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Well, then, I'll do the best I can; but I wish them<lb>
boys was to Jericho!' says the old lady, with a groan, for<lb>
she was fat and hot, had her gown pinned up, and was in a<lb>
fluster generally. She was goin' off rather huffy, when<lb>
Kitty called out, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Stop, ma! I'll come down and help you, only ketch me<lb>
if I tumble.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked scared but stiddy, and I'll bet it took as<lb>
much grit for her to do it as for one of us to face a battery.<lb>
It don't seem much to tell of, but I wish I may be hit if it<lb>
wasn't a right down dutiful and clever thing to see done.<lb>
When the old lady took her off at the bottom, with a good<lb>
motherly hug, I found myself huggin' my rifle like a fool, but<lb>
whether I thought it was the ladder, or Kitty, I ain't clear<lb>
about. `Good,' thinks I; `what more do you want?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snug little property wouldn't a ben bad, I reckon.<lb>
Well she had it, old skin-flint, though I didn't know or care<lb>
about it then. What a jolly row she'd make if she knew I<lb>
was tellin' the ladder part of the story! She always does<lb>
when I get to it, and makes believe cry, with her head in my<lb>
breast-pocket, or any such handy place, till I take it out and<lb>
swear I'll never do so ag'in. Poor little Kit, I wonder what<lb>
she's doin' now. Thinkin' of me, I'll bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick paused, pitched his cap lower over his eyes, and<lb>
smoked a minute with more energy than enjoyment, for his<lb>
cigar was out and he did not perceive it.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's not all, is it?&rdquo; asked Thorn, taking a fatherly<lb>
interest in the younger man's love passages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite. 'Fore long, Joe whistled, and as I always<lb>
take short cuts everywhar, I put in at the back-door, jest as<lb>
Kitty come trottin' out of the pantry with a big berry-pie in<lb>
her hand. I startled her, she tripped over the sill and down<lb>
she come; the dish flew one way, the pie flopped into her lap,<lb>
the juice spatterin' my boots and her clean gown. I thought<lb>
she'd cry, scold, have hysterics, or some confounded thing or<lb>
other; but she jest sat still a minute, then looked up at me<lb>
with a great blue splosh on her face, and went off into the<lb>
good-naturedest gale of laughin' you ever heard in your life.<lb>
That finished me. `Gay,' thinks I; `go in and win.' So<lb>
I did; made love hand over hand, while I stayed with Joe;<lb>
pupposed a fortnight after, married her in three months, and<lb>
there she is, a tip-top little woman, with a pair of stunnin'<lb>
boys in her arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out came a well-worn case, and Dick proudly displayed<lb>
the likeness of a stout, much bejewelled young woman, with<lb>
two staring infants on her knee. In his sight, the poor picture<lb>
was a more perfect work of art than any of Sir Joshua's<lb>
baby-beauties, or Raphael's Madonnas, and the little story<lb>
needed no better sequel than the young father's praises of his<lb>
twins, the covert kiss he gave their mother when he turned as<lb>
if to get a clearer light upon the face. Ashamed to show the<lb>
tenderness that filled his honest heart, he hummed &ldquo;Kingdom<lb>
Coming,&rdquo; while relighting his cigar, and presently began<lb>
to talk again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Flint, it's your turn to keep guard, and<lb>
Thorn's to tell his romance. Come, don't try to shirk; it<lb>
does a man good to talk of such things, and we're all mates<lb>
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some cases it don't do any good to talk of such<lb>
<pb n="010">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-011">

<figdesc>Page 010.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
things; better let 'em alone,&rdquo; muttered Thorn, as he reluctantly<lb>
sat down, while Flint as reluctantly departed.</p>
<p>With a glance and gesture of real affection, Phil laid his<lb>
hand upon his comrade's knee, saying, in his persuasive voice,<lb>
&ldquo;Old fellow, it <hi rend="italics">will</hi> do you good, because I know you often<lb>
long to speak of something that weighs upon you. You've<lb>
kept us steady many a time, and done us no end of kindnesses;<lb>
why be too proud to let us give our sympathy in return,<lb>
if nothing more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorn's big hand closed over the slender one upon his<lb>
knee, and the mild expression, so rarely seen upon his face,<lb>
passed over it as he replied, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could tell you almost anything if you asked me<lb>
that way, my boy. It isn't that I'm too proud, &mdash; and you're<lb>
right about my sometimes wanting to free my mind, &mdash; but it's<lb>
because a man of forty don't just like to open out to young<lb>
fellows, if there is any danger of their laughing at him,<lb>
though he may deserve it. I guess there isn't now, and I'll<lb>
tell you how I found my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick sat up, and Phil drew nearer, for the earnestness that<lb>
was in the man dignified his plain speech, and inspired an<lb>
interest in his history, even before it was begun. Looking<lb>
gravely at the river and never at his hearers, as if still a<lb>
little shy of confidants, yet grateful for the relief of words,<lb>
Thorn began abruptly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never hear the number eighty-four without clapping<lb>
my hand to my left breast and missing my badge. You know<lb>
I was on the police in New York, before the war, and that's<lb>
about all you do know yet. One bitter cold night, I was<lb>
going my rounds for the last time, when, as I turned a corner,<lb>
I saw there was a trifle of work to be done. It was a bad<lb>
part of the city, full of dirt and deviltry; one of the streets<lb>
led to a ferry, and at the corner an old woman had an<lb>

applestall. The poor soul had dropped asleep, worn out with the<lb>
cold, and there were her goods left, with no one to watch 'em.<lb>
Somebody was watching 'em, however; a girl, with a ragged<lb>
shawl over her head, stood at the mouth of an alley close by,<lb>
waiting for a chance to grab something. I'd seen her there<lb>
when I went by before, and mistrusted she was up to some<lb>
mischief; as I turned the corner, she put out her hand and<lb>
cribbed an apple. She saw me the minute she did it, but<lb>
neither dropped it nor ran, only stood stock still with the apple<lb>
in her hand till came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`This won't do, my girl,' said I. I never could be<lb>
harsh with 'em, poor things! She laid it back and looked up<lb>
at me with a miserable sort of a smile, that made me put my<lb>
hand in my pocket to fish for a ninepence before she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`I know it won't,' she says. `I didn't want to do it,<lb>
it's so mean, but I'm awful hungry, sir.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Better run home and get your supper then.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`I've got no home.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Where do you live?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`In the street.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Where do you sleep?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Anywhere; last night in the lock-up, and I thought<lb>
I'd get in there again, if I did that when you saw me. I<lb>
like to go there, it's warm and safe.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`If I don't take you there, what will you do?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Don't know. I want to go over there and dance again,<lb>
as I used to; but being sick has made me ugly, so they won't<lb>
have me, and no one else will take me because I have been<lb>
there once.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked where she pointed, and thanked the Lord that<lb>
they wouldn't take her. It was one of those low theatres<lb>
that do so much damage to the like of her; there was a<lb>
gambling den one side of it, an eating saloon the other, and<lb>

at the door of it lounged a scamp I knew very well, looking<lb>
like a big spider watching for a fly. I longed to fling my<lb>
billy at him; but as I couldn't, I held on to the girl. I was<lb>
new to the thing then, but though I'd heard about hunger<lb>
and homelessness often enough, I'd never had this sort of<lb>
thing, nor seen that look on a girl's face. A white, pinched<lb>
face hers was, with frightened, tired-looking eyes, but so innocent;<lb>
she wasn't more than sixteen, had been pretty once<lb>
I saw, looked sick and starved now, and seemed just the most<lb>
helpless, hopeless little thing that ever was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`You'd better come to the Station for to-night, and we'll<lb>
see to you to-morrow,' says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Thank you, sir,' says she, looking as grateful as if I'd<lb>
asked her home. I suppose I did speak kind of fatherly. I<lb>
ain't ashamed to say I felt so, seeing what a child she was;<lb>
nor to own that when she put her little hand in mine, it hurt<lb>
me to feel how thin and cold it was. We passed the eatinghouse<lb>
where the red lights made her face as rosy as it ought<lb>
to have been; there was meat and pies in the window, and<lb>
the poor thing stopped to look. It was too much for her;<lb>
off came her shawl, and she said in that coaxing way of hers, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`I wish you'd let me stop at the place close by and sell<lb>
this; they'll give a little for it, and I'll get some supper.<lb>
I've had nothing since yesterday morning, and maybe cold is<lb>
easier to bear than hunger.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Have you nothing better than that to sell?' I says, not<lb>
quite sure that she wasn't all a humbug, like so many of 'em.<lb>
She seemed to see that, and looked up at me again with<lb>
such innocent eyes, I couldn't doubt her when she said, shivering<lb>
with something beside the cold, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Nothing but myself.' Then the tears came, and she<lb>
laid her head down on my arm, sobbing, &mdash; `Keep me! oh,<lb>
do keep me safe somewhere!&rdquo;'</p>

<p>Thorn choked here, steadied his voice with a resolute hem!<lb>
but could only add one sentence more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's how I found my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, don't stop thar? I told the whole o' mine, you<lb>
do the same. Whar did you take her? how'd it all come<lb>
round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell us, Thorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentler request was answered presently, very steadily,<lb>
very quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was always a soft-hearted fellow, though you wouldn't<lb>
think it now, and when that little girl asked me to keep her<lb>
safe, I just did it. I took her to a good woman whom I<lb>
knew, for I hadn't any women belonging to me, nor any<lb>
place but that to put her in. She stayed there till spring<lb>
working for her keep, growing brighter, prettier, every day,<lb>
and fonder of me I thought. If I believed in witchcraft, I<lb>
shouldn't think myself such a cursed fool as I do now, but I<lb>
don't believe in it, and to this day I can't understand how I<lb>
came to do it. To be sure I was a lonely man, without kith<lb>
or kin, had never had a sweetheart in my life, or been much<lb>
with women since my mother died. Maybe that's why I was<lb>
so bewitched with Mary, for she had little ways with her that<lb>
took your fancy and made you love her whether you would<lb>
or no. I found her father was an honest fellow enough, a<lb>
fiddler in some theatre, that he'd taken good care of Mary<lb>
till he died, leaving precious little but advice for her to live<lb>
on. She'd tried to get work, failed, spent all she had, got<lb>
sick, and was going to the devil, as the poor souls can hardly<lb>
help doing with so many ready to give them a shove. It's no<lb>
use trying to make a bad job better; so the long and short of<lb>
it was, I thought she loved me; God knows I loved her, and I<lb>
married her before the year was out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show us her picture; I know you've got one; all the<lb>
fellows have, though half of 'em won't own up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've only got part of one. I once saved my little girl,<lb>
and her picture once saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From an inner pocket Thorn produced a woman's housewife,<lb>
carefully untied it, though all its implements were missing<lb>
but a little thimble, and from one of its compartments<lb>
took a flattened bullet and the remnants of a picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave her that the first Christmas after I found her.<lb>
She wasn't as tidy about her clothes as I liked to see, and I<lb>
thought if I gave her a handy thing like this, she'd be willing<lb>
to sew. But she only made one shirt for me, and then got<lb>
tired, so I keep it like an old fool, as I am. Yes, that's the<lb>
bit of lead that would have done for me, if Mary's likeness<lb>
hadn't been just where it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'll like to show her this when you go home, won't<lb>
you?&rdquo; said Dick, as he took up the bullet, while Phil examined<lb>
the marred picture, and Thorn poised the little thimble<lb>
on his big finger, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I, when I don't know where she is, and camp<lb>
is all the home I've got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words broke from him like a sudden cry, when some<lb>
old wound is rudely touched. Both of the young men<lb>
started, both laid back the relics they had taken up, and<lb>
turned their eyes from Thorn's face, across which swept a<lb>
look of shame and sorrow, too significant to be misunderstood.<lb>
Their silence assured him of their sympathy, and, as if that<lb>
touch of friendlessness unlocked his heavy heart, he eased it<lb>
by a full confession. When he spoke again, it was with the<lb>
calmness of repressed emotion; and calmness more touching<lb>
to his mates than the most passionate outbreak, the most<lb>
pathetic lamentation; for the coarse camp-phrases seemed to<lb>

drop from his vocabulary; more than once his softened voice<lb>
grew tremulous, and to the words &ldquo;my little girl,&rdquo; there<lb>
went a tenderness that proved how dear a place she still retained<lb>
in that deep heart of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I've gone so far; I may as well finish; and you'll<lb>
see I'm not without some cause for my stern looks and ways;<lb>
you'll pity me, and from you I'll take the comfort of it. It's<lb>
only the old story, &mdash; I married her, worked for her, lived<lb>
for her, and kept my little girl like a lady. I should have<lb>
known that I was too old, too sober, for a young thing like<lb>
that; the life she led before the pinch came just suited her.<lb>
She liked to be admired, to dress and dance and make herself<lb>
pretty for all the world to see; not to keep house for a quiet<lb>
man like me. Idleness wasn't good for her, it bred discontent;<lb>
then some of her old friends, who'd left her in her<lb>
trouble, found her out when better times came round, and<lb>
tried to get her back again. I was away all day, I didn't<lb>
know how things were going, and she wasn't open with me,<lb>
afraid, she said; I was so grave, and hated theatres so. She<lb>
got courage, finally, to tell me that she wasn't happy; that<lb>
she wanted to dance again, and asked me if she mightn't. I'd<lb>
rather have had her ask me to put her in a fire, for I <hi rend="italics">did</hi><lb>
hate theatres, and was bred to; others think they're no<lb>
harm. I do; and knew it was a bad life for a girl like mine,<lb>
It pampers vanity, and vanity is the Devil's help with such;<lb>
so I said No, kindly at first, sharp and stern when she kept<lb>
on teasing. That roused her spirit. `I will go!' she<lb>
said, one day. `Not while you're my wife,' I answered<lb>
back; and neither said any more, but she gave me a look<lb>
I didn't think she could, and I resolved to take her away<lb>
from temptation before worse came of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't tell her my plan; but I resigned my place, spent<lb>
a week or more finding and fixing a little home for her out in<lb>

the wholesome country, where she'd be safe from theatres and<lb>
disreputable friends, and maybe learn to love me better when<lb>
she saw how much she was to me. It was coming summer,<lb>
and I made things look as home-like and as pretty as I<lb>
could. She liked flowers, and I fixed a garden for her;<lb>
she was fond of pets, and I got her a bird, a kitten, and a<lb>
dog to play with her; she fancied gay colors and tasty little<lb>
matters, so I filled her rooms with all the handsome things I<lb>
could afford, and when it was done, I was as pleased as any<lb>
boy, thinking what happy times we'd have together and how<lb>
pleased she'd be. Boys, when I went to tell her and to<lb>
take her to her little home, she was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With those cursed friends of hers; a party of them left<lb>
the city just then; she was wild to go; she had money now,<lb>
and all her good looks back again. They teased and tempted<lb>
her; I wasn't there to keep her, and she went, leaving a<lb>
line behind to tell me that she loved the old life more than<lb>
the new; that my house was a prison, and she hoped I'd<lb>
let her go in peace. That almost killed me; but I managed<lb>
to bear it, for I knew most of the fault was mine; but<lb>
it was awful bitter to think I hadn't saved her, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Thorn! what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went straight after her; found her dancing in Philadelphia,<lb>
with paint on her cheeks, trinkets on her neck and<lb>
arms, looking prettier than ever; but the innocent eyes<lb>
were gone, and I couldn't see my little girl in the bold, handsome<lb>
woman twirling there before the foolights. She saw me,<lb>
looked scared at first, then smiled, and danced on with her<lb>
eyes upon me, as if she said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`See! I'm happy now; go away and let me be.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn't stand that, and got out somehow. People<lb>
thought me mad, or drunk; I didn't care, I only wanted to<lb>

see her once in quiet and try to get her home. I couldn't<lb>
do it then nor afterwards by fair means, and I wouldn't try<lb>
force. I wrote to her, promised to forgive her, begged her<lb>
to come back, or let me keep her honestly somewhere away<lb>
from me. But she never answered, never came, and I have<lb>
never tried again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn't worthy of you, Thorn; you jest forgit her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could! I wish I could!&rdquo; in his voice quivered<lb>
an almost passionate regret, and a great sob heaved<lb>
his chest, as he turned his face away to hide the love and<lb>
longing, still so tender and so strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't say that, Dick; such fidelity should make us<lb>
charitable for its own sake. There is always time for penitence,<lb>
always certainty of pardon. Take heart, Thorn, you<lb>
may not wait in vain, and she may yet return to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she will! I've dreamed of it, I've prayed for<lb>
it; every battle I come out of safe makes me surer that I<lb>
was kept for that, and when I've borne enough to atone for<lb>
my part of the fault, I'll be repaid for all my patience, all<lb>
my pain, by finding her again. She knows how well I love<lb>
her still, and if there comes a time when she is sick and<lb>
poor and all alone again, then she'll remember her old John,<lb>
then she'll come home and let me take her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hope shone in Thorn's melancholy eyes, and long-suffering<lb>
all-forgiving love beautified the rough, brown face, as he<lb>
folded his arms and bent his gray head on his breast, as if<lb>
the wanderer were already come.</p>
<p>The emotion which Dick scorned to show on his own account<lb>
was freely manifested for another, as he sniffed audibly,<lb>
and, boy-like, drew his sleeve across his eyes. But<lb>
Phil, with the delicate perception of a finer nature, felt that<lb>
the truest kindness he could show his friend was to distract<lb>
his thoughts from himself, to spare him any comments, and<lb>

lessen the embarrassment which would surely follow such<lb>
unwonted confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I'll relieve Flint, and he will give you a laugh.<lb>
Come on Hiram and tell us about your Beulah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman addressed had performed his duty by sitting<lb>
on a fence and &ldquo;righting up&rdquo; his pockets, to beguile<lb>
the tedium of his exile. Before his multitudinous possessions<lb>
could be restored to their native sphere, Thorn was himself<lb>
again, and on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are Phil; I like to tramp, it seems like<lb>
old times, and I know you're tired. Just forget all this I've<lb>
been saying, and go on as before. Thank you, boys! thank<lb>
you!&rdquo; and with a grasp of the two hands extended to him,<lb>
he strode away along the path already worn by his own restless<lb>
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's done him good, and I'm glad of that; but I'd like<lb>
to see the little baggage that bewitched the poor old boy,<lb>
wouldn't you, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! here's Flint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's up naow? want me tew address the meetin',<lb>
hey? I'm willin', only the laugh's ruther ag'inst me, ef I<lb>
tell that story; expect yeu'll like it all the better fer that.&rdquo;<lb>
Flint coiled up his long limbs, put his hands in his pockets,<lb>
chewed meditatively for a moment, and then began with his<lb>
slowest drawl: &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, sir, it's pretty nigh ten year ago, I was damster<lb>
daown tew Oldtaown, elos't tew Banggore. My folks lived<lb>
tew Bethel; there was only the old man, and Aunt Siloam,<lb>
keepin' house fer him, seein' as I was the only chick he hed.<lb>
I hedn't heared from 'em fer a long spell, when there come<lb>
a letter sayin' the old man was breakin' up. He'd said it<lb>
every spring fer a number er years, and I didn't mind it no<lb>
more'n the breakin' up er the river; not so much jest then;<lb>

fer the gret spring drive was comin' on, and my hands was<lb>
tew full to quit work all tew oncet. I sent word I'd be'<lb>
long fore a gret while, and bymeby I went. I ought tew<lb>
hev gone at fust; but they'd sung aout `Wolf!' so often I<lb>
warn't scared; an' sure 'nuff the wolf did come at last.<lb>
Father hed been dead an' berried a week when I got there,<lb>
and aunt was so mad she wouldn't write, nor scurcely speak<lb>
tew me fer a consider'ble spell. I didn't blame her a mite, and<lb>
felt jest the wust kind; so I give in every way, and fetched<lb>
her raound. Yeou see I hed a cousin who'd kind er took<lb>
my place tew hum while I was off, an' the old man hed left<lb>
him a good slice er his money, an' me the farm, hopin' to<lb>
keep me there. He'd never liked the lumberin' bizness, an'<lb>
hankered arfter me a sight, I faound. Waal, seein' haow'<lb>
twas, I tried tew please him, late as it was; but ef there<lb>
was ennything I did spleen ag'inst, it was farmin, 'specially<lb>
arfter the smart times I'd ben hevin, up Oldtaown way.<lb>
Yeou don't know nothin' abaout it; but ef yeou want tew see<lb>
high dewin's, jest hitch onto a timber-drive an' go it daown<lb>
along them lakes and rivers, say from Kaumchenungamooth<lb>
tew Punnobscot Bay. Guess yeou'd see a thing or tew, an'<lb>
find livin' on a log come as handy as ef yeou was born a<lb>
turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, I stood it one summer; but it was the longest<lb>
kind of a job. Come fall I turned contrary, darned the<lb>
farm, and vaowed I'd go back tew loggin'. Aunt hed got<lb>
fond er me by that time, and felt dreadful bad abaout my<lb>
leavin' on her. Cousin Siah, as we called Josiah, didn't<lb>
cotton tew the old woman, though he did tew her cash; but<lb>
we hitched along fust-rate. She was 'tached tew the place,<lb>
hated tew hev it let or sold, thought I'd go to everlastin'<lb>
rewin ef I took tew lumberin' ag'in, an' hevin' a tidy little<lb>
sum er money all her own, she took a notion tew buy me off.<lb>

`Hiram,' sez she, `ef yeou'll stay tew hum, merry some<lb>
smart gal, an' kerry on the farm, I'll leave yeou the hull er<lb>
my fortin. Ef yeou don't, I'll leave every cent on't tew<lb>
Siah, though he ain't done as waal by me as yeou hev.<lb>
Come,' sez she, `I'm breakin' up like brother; I shan't wurry<lb>
any one a gret while, and 'fore spring I dessay you'll hev<lb>
cause tew rejice that yeou done as Aunt Si counselled yeou.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that idee kinder took me, seein' I hedn't no overpaourin'<lb>
love fer cousin; but I brewdid over it a spell 'fore<lb>
I 'greed. Fin'lly, I said I'd dew it, as it warn't a hard nor<lb>
a bad trade; and begun to look raound fer Mis Flint, Jr.<lb>
Aunt was dreadf'l pleased; but 'mazin pertickler as tew<lb>
who was goan tew stan' in her shoes, when she was fetched<lb>
up ag'inst the etarnal boom. There was a sight er lovely<lb>
women-folks raound taown; but aunt she set her foot daown<lb>
that Mis Flint must be smart, pious, an' good-natered; harnsome<lb>
she didn't say nothin' abaout, bein' the humliest woman<lb>
in the State er Maine. I hed my own calk'lations on that pint,<lb>
an' went sparkin' two or three er the pootiest gals, all that<lb>
winter. I warn't in no hurry, fer merryin' is an awful<lb>
resky bizness; an' I warn't goan to be took in by nobuddy.<lb>
Some haouw I couldn't make up my mind which I'd hev,<lb>
and kept dodgin', all ready to slew raound, an' hitch on tew<lb>
ary one that seemed likeliest. 'Long in March, aunt, she<lb>
ketched cold, took tew her bed, got wuss, an' told me tew<lb>
hurry up, fer nary red should I hev, ef I warn't safely merried'<lb>
fore she stepped out. I thought that was ruther<lb>
craoudin' a feller; but I see she was goan sure, an' I'd got<lb>
intew a way er considerin' the cash mine, so that it come<lb>
hard to hear abaout givin' on't up. Off I went that evenin'<lb>
an' asked Almiry Nash ef she'd hev me. No, she wouldn't;<lb>
I'd shilly-shallyed so long, she'd got tired er waitin' and<lb>
took tew keepin' company with a doctor daown tew<lb>

Banggore, where she'd ben visitin' a spell. I didn't find that as<lb>
hard a rub to swaller, as I'd a thought I would, though<lb>
Almiry was the ricliest, pootiest, and good-naterest of the<lb>
lot. Aunt larfed waal, an' told me tew try agin; so a<lb>
couple er nights arfter, I spruced up, an' went over to Car'line<lb>
Miles's; she was as smart as old cheese, an' waal off<lb>
intew the barg'in. I was just as sure she'd hev me, as I be<lb>
that I'm gittin' the rewmatiz a settin' in this ma'sh. But<lb>
that minx, Almiry, hed ben and let on abaout her own sarsy<lb>
way er servin' on me, an' Car'line jest up an' said she warn't<lb>
goan to hev annybuddy's leavin's; so daown I come ag'in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things was gettin' desper't by that time; fer aunt was<lb>
failin' rapid, an' the story hed leaked aout some way, so the<lb>
hull taown was gigglin' over it. I thought I'd better quit<lb>
them parts; but aunt she showed me her will all done complete, '<lb>
sceptin' the fust name er the legatee. `There,' sez<lb>
she, `it all depends on yeou, whether that place is took by<lb>
Hiram or Josiah. It's easy done, an' so it's goan tew stan'<lb>
till the last minnit.' That riled me consid'able, an' I<lb>
streaked off tew May Jane Simlin's. She want very waal off,<lb>
nor extra harnsome, but she was pious the wust kind, an'<lb>
dreadf'l clever to them she fancied. But I was daown on<lb>
my luck agin; fer at the fust word I spoke of merryin', she<lb>
showed me the door, an' give me to understan' that she<lb>
couldn't think er hevin' a man that warn't a church-member,<lb>
that hadn't experienced religion, or even ben struck with<lb>
conviction, an' all the rest on't. Ef anny one hed a wanted<lb>
tew hev seen a walkin' hornet's nest, they could hev done it<lb>
cheap that night, as I went hum. I jest stramed intew the<lb>

sez she, real sort o' cunnin', &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Poor Hiram! they didn't use yeou waal. Yeou ought<lb>
to hev tried some er the poor an' humly girls; they'd a' been<lb>
glad an' grateful fer such a sweetheart as yeou be.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was good-natered agin by that time, an' I sez, larfin'<lb>
along with her, `Waal I've got three mittens, but I guess I<lb>
might's waal hev 'nother, and that will make two pair complete.<lb>
Say, Bewlah, will yeou hev me?'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Yes, I will,' sez she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Reelly?' sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Solemn trew,' sez she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef she'd up an' slapped me in the face, I shouldn't<lb>
hev ben more throwed aback, fer I never mistrusted she<lb>
cared two chips for me. I jest set an' gawped; fer she was<lb>
solemn trew, I see that with half an eye, an' it kinder took<lb>
my breath away. Bewlah drawed the grewel off the fire,<lb>
wiped her hands, an' stood lookin' at me a minnet, then she<lb>
sez, slow an' quiet, but tremblin' a little, as women hev a<lb>
way er doin', when they've consid'able steam aboard, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Hiram, other folks think lumberin' has spilt yeou; I<lb>
don't; they call yeou rough an' rewd; I know you've got a<lb>
real kind heart fer them as knows haow tew find it. Them<lb>
girls give yeou up so easy, 'cause they never loved yeou,<lb>
an' yeou give them up 'cause yeou only thought abaout<lb>

shook daown fer me, kerried my bag, and kissed me tew the<lb>
gate, when all the others shunned me, 'cause my father drank<lb>
an' I was shably dressed, ugly, an' shy. Yeou asked me in<lb>
sport, I answered in airnest; but I don't expect nothin' unless<lb>
yeou mean as I mean. Like me, Hiram, or leave me, it<lb>
won't make no odds in my lovin' er yeou, nor helpin' er<lb>
yeou, ef I kin.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Tain't easy tew say haouw I felt, while she was goin'<lb>
on that way; but my idees was tumblin; raound inside er<lb>
me, as ef half a dozen dams was broke loose all tew oncet.<lb>
One thing was ruther stiddier 'n the rest, an' that was that I<lb>
liked Bewlah morn'n I knew. I begun tew see what kep<lb>
me loopin' tew hum so much, sence aunt was took daown;<lb>
why I want in no hurry tew git them other gals, an' haow I<lb>
come tew pocket my mittens so easy arfter the fust rile was<lb>
over. Bewlah was humly, poor in flesh, dreadful freckled,<lb>
hed red hair, black eyes, an' a gret mold side er her nose.<lb>
But I'd got wonted tew her; she knowed my ways, was a<lb>
fust rate housekeeper, real good-tempered, and pious without<lb>
flingin' on't in yer face. She was a lonely creeter, &mdash; her folks<lb>
bein' all dead but one sister, who didn't use her waal, an'<lb>
somehow I kinder yearned over her, as they say in Scripter.<lb>
For all I set an' gawped, I was coming raound fast, though I<lb>
felt as I used tew, when I was goin' to shoot the rapids,<lb>
kinder breathless an' oncertin, whether Id come aout right<lb>
side up or not. Queer, warn't it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, Flint; that was a sure symptom of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, guess 'twas; anyway I jumped up all er a sudden,<lb>
ketched Bewlah raound the neck, give her a hearty kiss,<lb>
and sung aout, `I'll dew it sure's my name's Hi Flint!'<lb>
The words was scurcely aout er my maouth, 'fore daown<lb>
come Dr. Parr. He'd ben up tew see aunt, an' said she<lb>
wouldn't last the night threw, prob'ly. That give me a scare<lb>

er the wust kind; an' when I told doctor haow things was,<lb>
he sez, kinder jokin', &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Better git merried right away, then. Parson Dill is<lb>
tew come an' see the old lady, an' he'll dew both jobs tew<lb>
oncet.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Will yeou, Bewlah?' sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Yes, Hiram, to 'blige yeou,' sez she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that, I put it fer the parson and the license; got'<lb>
em both, an' was back in less'n half an haour, most tuckered<lb>
aout with the flurry er the hull concern. Quick as I'd<lb>
been, Bewlah hed faound time tew whip on her best gaoun,<lb>
fix up her hair, and put a couple er white chrissanthymums<lb>
intew her hank'chif pin. Fer the fust time in her life, she<lb>
looked harnsome, &mdash; leastways I thought so, &mdash; with a pretty<lb>
color in her cheeks, somethin' brighter'n a larf shinin' in<lb>
her eyes, an' her lips smilin' an' tremblin', as she come to<lb>
me an' whispered so's't none er the rest could hear, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Hiram, don't yeou dew it, ef yeou'd ruther not. I've<lb>
stood it a gret while alone, an' I guess I can ag'in.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never yeou mind what I said or done abaout that; but<lb>
we was merried ten minutes arfter, 'fore the kitchen fire, with<lb>
Dr. Parr an' oaur hired man, fer witnesses; an' then we all<lb>
went up tew aunt. She was goan fast, but she understood<lb>
what I told her, hed strength tew fill up the hole in the<lb>
will, an' to say, a-kissin' Bewlah, `Yeou'll be a good wife,<lb>
an' naouw yeou ain't a poor one.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn't help givin' a peek tew the will, and there I<lb>
see not Hiram Flint, nor Josiah Flint, but Bewlah Flint,<lb>
wrote every which way, but as plain as the nose on yer face.<lb>
`It won't make no odds dear,' whispered my wife, peekin'<lb>
over my shoulder. `Guess it won't!' sez I, aout laoud;<lb>
`I'm glad on't, and it ain't a cent more'n yeou derserve.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pleased aunt. `Riz me, Hiram,' sez she; an'<lb>

when I'd got her easy, she put her old arms raound my<lb>
neck, an' tried to say, `God bless you, dear &mdash;,' but died a<lb>
doin' of it; an' I ain't ashamed tew say I boo-hooed real<lb>
hearty, when I laid her daown, fer she was dreadf'l good<lb>
tew me, an' I don't forgit her in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How's Bewlah?&rdquo; asked Dick, after the little tribute of<lb>
respect all paid to Aunt Siloam's memory, by a momentary<lb>
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fust-rate! that harum scarum venter er mine was the<lb>
best I ever made. She's done waal by me, hes Bewlah;<lb>
ben a grand good haousekeeper, kin kerry on the farm better'n<lb>
me, any time, an' is as dutif'l an' lovin' a wife as, &mdash;<lb>
waal as annything that <hi rend="italics">is</hi> extra dutif'l and lovin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any boys to brag of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don't think much o' boys daown aour way; they're'<lb>
mazin resky stock to fetch up, &mdash; alluz breakin' baounds, gittin'<lb>
intew the paound, and wurry your life aout somehaow'<lb>
nother. Gals naow doos waal; I got six o' the likeliest<lb>
the is goin', every one on 'em is the very moral of Bewlah,&mdash;<lb>
red hair, black eyes, quiet ways, an' a mold side the nose.<lb>
Baby's ain't growed yet; but I expect tew see it in a consid'able<lb>
state o' forrardness, when I git hum, an' wouldn't<lb>
miss it fer the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The droll expressions of Flint's face, and the satisfied<lb>
twang of his last words, were irresistable. Dick and Phil went<lb>
off into a shout of laughter; and even Thorn's grave lips relapsed<lb>
into a smile at the vision of six little Flints with their<lb>
six little moles. As if the act were an established ceremony,<lb>
the &ldquo;paternal head&rdquo; produced his pocket-book, selected a<lb>
worn, black and white paper, which he spread in his broad<lb>
palm, and displayed with the air of a connoisseur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, thets Bewlah! we call it a cuttin'; but the proper<lb>
name's a silly-hoot I b'leeve. I've got a harnsome big<lb>

degarrytype tew hum but the heft on't makes it bad tew<lb>
kerry raound, so I took this. I don't tote it abaout inside<lb>
my shirt as some dew, &mdash; it aint my way; but I keep it in my<lb>
puss long with my other valleu'bles, and guess I set as<lb>
much stoxe by it as ef it was all painted up, and done off to<lb>
keell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;silly-hoot&rdquo; was examined with interest, and carefully<lb>
stowed away again in the old brown wallet which was<lb>
settled in its place with a satisfied slap, then Flint said<lb>
briskly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naouw, Phil, yeou close this interestin' and instructive<lb>
meeting; and be spry, fer time's most up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven't much to tell, but must begin with a confession<lb>
which I have often longed but never dared to make before,<lb>
because I am a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho! who's goan to b'leeve that o' a man who fit like<lb>
a wild cat, wuz offered fer permotion on the field, and wuz<lb>
reported tew headquarters arfter his fust scrimmage. Try<lb>
ag'in, Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physical courage is as plentiful as brass buttons, nowadays,<lb>
but moral courage is a rarer virtue; and I'm lacking in<lb>
it, as I'll prove. You think me a Virginian; I'm an Alabamian<lb>
by birth, and was a reb three months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This confession startled his hearers, as he knew it would,<lb>
for he had kept his secret well. Thorn laid his hand involuntarily<lb>
upon his rifle, Dick drew off a little, and Flint illustrated<lb>
one of his own expressions, for he &ldquo;gawped.&rdquo;<lb>
Phil laughed that musical laugh of his, and looked up at<lb>
them with his dark face waking into sudden life as he<lb>
went on: &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's no treason in the camp, for I'm as fierce a Federalist<lb>
as any of you now, and you may thank a woman for<lb>
it. When Lee made his raid into Pennsylvania, I was a<lb>

</eaffig>
lieutenant in the &mdash; well, never mind what regiment, it<lb>
hasn't signalized itself since, and I'd rather not hit my old<lb>
neighbors when they are down. In one of the skirmishes<lb>
during our retreat, I got a wound and was left for dead. A<lb>
kind old Quaker found and took me home; but though I was<lb>
too weak to talk, I had my senses by that time, and knew<lb>
what went on about me. Everything was in confusion, even<lb>
in that well-ordered place; no surgeon could be got at first,<lb>
and a flock of frightened women thee'd and thou'd one another<lb>
over me, but hadn't wit enough to see that I was bleeding<lb>
to death. Among the faces that danced before my dizzy<lb>
eyes was one that seemed familiar, probably because no cap<lb>
surrounded it. I was glad to have it bending over me, to<lb>
hear a steady voice say, `Give me a bandage, quick!' and<lb>
when none was instantly forthcoming to me, the young lady<lb>
stripped up a little white apron she wore, and stanched the<lb>
wound in my shoulder. I was not as badly hurt as I supposed,<lb>
but so worn-out, and faint from loss of blood, they believed<lb>
me to be dying, and so did I, when the old man took<lb>
off his hat and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Friend, if thee has anything to say, thee had better say<lb>
it, for thee probably has not long to live.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of my little sister, far away in Alabama,<lb>
fancied she came to me, and muttered, `Amy, kiss me,<lb>
good-by.' The women sobbed at that; but the girl bent<lb>
her sweet compassionate face to mine, and kissed me on the<lb>
forehead. That was my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you seceded from Secession right away, to pay for<lb>
that lip-service, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Thorn, not right away, &mdash; to my shame be it spoken.<lb>
I'll tell you how it came about. Margaret was not old<lb>
Bent's daughter, but a Virginia girl on a visit, and a long<lb>
one it proved, for she couldn't go till things were quieter.<lb>
<pb n="028">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-029">

</eaffig>
While she waited, she helped take care of me; for the good<lb>
souls petted me like a baby when they found that a Rebel<lb>
could be a gentleman. I held my tongue, and behaved my<lb>
best to prove my gratitude, you know. Of course, I loved<lb>
Margaret very soon. How could I help it? She was the<lb>
sweetest woman I had ever seen, tender, frank, and spirited;<lb>
all I had ever dreamed of and longed for. I did not speak<lb>
of this, nor hope for a return, because I knew she was a<lb>
hearty Unionist, and thought she only tended me from pity.<lb>
But suddenly she decided to go home, and when I ventured<lb>
to wish she would stay longer, she would not listen, and<lb>
said, &ldquo;I must not stay; I should have gone before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words were nothing, but as she uttered them the<lb>
color came up beautifully over all her face, and her eyes<lb>
filled as they looked away from mine. Then I knew that<lb>
she loved me, and my secret broke out half against my will.<lb>
Margaret was forced to listen, for I would not let her go, but<lb>
she seemed to harden herself against me, growing colder,<lb>
stiller, statelier, as I went on, and when I said in my desperate<lb>
way, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`You should love me, for we are bid to love our enemies,'<lb>
she flashed an indignant look at me and said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`I will not love what I cannot respect! Come to me a<lb>
loyal man, and see what answer I shall give you.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she went away. It was the wisest thing she could<lb>
have done, for absence did more to change me than an ocean<lb>
of tears, a year of exhortations. Lying there, I missed her<lb>
every hour of the day, recalled every gentle act, kind word,<lb>
and fair example she had given me. I contrasted my own belief<lb>
with hers, and found a new significance in the words<lb>
honesty and honor, and, remembering her fidelity to principle,<lb>
was ashamed of my own treason to God and to herself.<lb>
Education, prejudice, and interest, are difficult things to<lb>
<pb n="029">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-030">

</eaffig>
overcome, and that was the hottest fight I ever passed through,<lb>
for, as I tell you, I was a coward. But love and loyalty<lb>
won the day, and, asking no quarter, the Rebel surrendered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil Beaufort, you're a brick!&rdquo; cried Dick, with a<lb>
sounding slap on his comrade's shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brand snatched from the burnin'. Hallelujah!&rdquo;<lb>
chanted Flint, seesawing with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you went to find your wife? How? Where?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Thorn, forgetting vigilance in interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend Bent hated war so heartily that he would have<lb>
nothing to do with paroles, exchanges, or any martial process<lb>
whatever, but bade me go when and where I liked, remembering<lb>
to do by others as I had been done by. Before I<lb>
was well enough to go, however, I managed, by means of<lb>
Copperhead influence and returned prisoners, to send a letter<lb>
to my father and receive an answer. You can imagine what<lb>
both contained; and so I found myself penniless, but not poor,<lb>
an outcast, but not alone. Old Bent treated me like a prodigal<lb>
son, and put money in my purse; his pretty daughters<lb>
loved me for Margaret's sake, and gave me a patriotic salute<lb>
all round when I left them, the humblest, happiest man in<lb>
Pennsylvania. Margaret once said to me that this was the<lb>
time for deeds, not words; that no man should stand idle, but<lb>
serve the good cause with head, heart, and hand, no matter in<lb>
what rank; for in her eyes a private fighting for liberty was<lb>
nobler than a dozen generals defending slavery. I remembered<lb>
that, and, not having influential friends to get me a<lb>
commission, enlisted in one of her own Virginia regiments,<lb>
knowing that no act of mine would prove my sincerity like<lb>
that. You should have seen her face when I walked in upon<lb>
her, as she sat alone, busied with the army work, as I'd so<lb>
often seen her sitting by my bed; it showed me all she had<lb>
been suffering in silence, all I should have lost had I chosen<lb>
<pb n="030">

</eaffig>
darkness instead of light. She hoped and feared so much<lb>
she could not speak, neither could I, but dropped my cloak,<lb>
and showed her that, through love of her, I had become a<lb>
soldier of the Flag. How I love the coarse blue uniform!<lb>
for when she saw it, she came to me without a word and<lb>
kept her promise in a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder! what a harnsome woman!&rdquo; exclaimed Flint,<lb>
as Phil, opening the golden case that held his talisman, showed<lb>
them the beautiful, beloved face of which he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! and a right noble woman too. I don't deserve<lb>
her, but I will. We parted on our wedding-day, for orders<lb>
to be off came suddenly, and she would not let me go until<lb>
I had given her my name to keep. We were married in<lb>
the morning, and at noon I had to go. Other women wept<lb>
as we marched through the town, but my brave Margaret<lb>
kept her tears till we were gone, smiling, and waving her hand<lb>
to me, &mdash; the hand that wore the wedding-ring, &mdash; till I was<lb>
out of sight. That image of her is before me day and night,<lb>
and day and night her last words are ringing in my ears,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`I give you freely, do your best. Better a true man's<lb>
widow than a traitor's wife.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I've only stood on the right side for a month;<lb>
I've only fought one battle, earned one honor; but I believe<lb>
these poor achievements are an earnest of the long atonement<lb>
I desire to make for five and twenty years of blind<lb>
transgression. You say I fight well. Have I not cause to<lb>
dare much? &mdash; for in owning many slaves, I too became a slave;<lb>
in helping to make many freemen, I liberate myself. You<lb>
wonder why I refused promotion. Have I any right to it<lb>
yet? Are there not men who never sinned as I have done,<lb>
and beside whose sacrifices mine look pitifully small? You<lb>
tell me I have no ambition. I have the highest, for I desire<lb>
to become God's noblest work, &mdash; an honest man, &mdash; living,<lb>
<pb n="031">

</eaffig>
to make Margaret happy, in a love that every hour grows<lb>
worthier of her own, &mdash; dying, to make death proud to take<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phil had risen while he spoke, as if the enthusiasm of<lb>
his mood lifted him into the truer manhood he aspired to<lb>
attain. Straight and strong he stood up in the moonlight,<lb>
his voice deepened by unwonted energy, his eye clear and<lb>
steadfast, his whole face ennobled by the regenerating power<lb>
of this late loyalty to country, wife, and self, and bright<lb>
against the dark blue of his jacket shone the pictured face,<lb>
the only medal he was proud to wear.</p>
<p>Ah, brave, brief moment, cancelling years of wrong! Ah,<lb>
fair and fatal decoration, serving as a mark for a hidden foe!<lb>
The sharp crack of a rifle broke the stillness of the night,<lb>
and with those hopeful words upon his lips, the young man<lb>
sealed his purpose with his life.</p>

<p>FIVE and twenty ladies, all in a row, sat on one side of the<lb>
hall, looking very much as if they felt like the little old<lb>
woman who fell asleep on the king's highway and awoke with<lb>
abbreviated drapery, for they were all arrayed in gray tunics<lb>
and Turkish continuations, profusely adorned with many-colored<lb>
trimmings. Five and twenty gentlemen, all in a<lb>
row, sat on the opposite side of the hall, looking somewhat<lb>
subdued, as men are apt to do when they fancy they are in<lb>
danger of making fools of themselves. They, also, were <hi rend="italics">en</hi><lb>
costume, for all the dark ones had grown piratical in red<lb>
shirts, the light ones nautical in blue; and a few boldly appeared<lb>
in white, making up in starch and studs what they lost<lb>
in color, while all were more or less Byronic as to collar.</p>
<p>On the platform appeared a pile of dumb-bells, a regiment<lb>
of clubs, and a pyramid of bean-bags, and stirring nervously<lb>
among them a foreign-looking gentleman, the new leader of<lb>
a class lately formed by Dr. Thor Turner, whose mission it<lb>
was to strengthen the world's spine, and convert it to a belief<lb>
in air and exercise, by setting it to balancing its poles<lb>
and spinning merrily, while enjoying the &ldquo;Sun-cure&rdquo; on a<lb>
large scale. His advent formed an epoch in the history of<lb>
the town; for it was a quiet old village, guiltless of bustle,<lb>
fashion, or parade, where each man stood for what he was;<lb>
and, being a sagacious set, every one's true value was pretty<lb>
accurately known. It was a neighborly town, with gossip<lb>
<pb n="033">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-034">

<figdesc>Page 033.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="3">
enough to stir the social atmosphere with small gusts of interest<lb>
or wonder, yet do no harm. A sensible, free-and-easy<lb>
town, for the wisest man in it wore the worst boots, and no one<lb>
thought the less of his understanding; the belle of the village<lb>
went shopping with a big sun-bonnet and tin pail, and<lb>
no one found her beauty lessened; oddities of all sorts<lb>
ambled peacefully about on their various hobbies, and no one<lb>
suggested the expediency of a trip on the wooden horse upon<lb>
which the chivalrous South is always eager to mount an irrepressible<lb>
abolitionist. Restless people were soothed by the<lb>
lullaby the river sang in its slow journey to the sea, old people<lb>
found here a pleasant place to make ready to die-in,<lb>
young people to survey the world from, before taking their<lb>
first flight, and strangers looked back upon it, as a quiet nook<lb>
full of ancient legends and modern lights, which would keep<lb>
its memory green when many a gayer spot was quite forgotten.<lb>
Anything based upon common sense found favor with<lb>
the inhabitants, and Dr. Turner's theories, being eminently<lb>
so, were accepted at once and energetically carried out. A<lb>
sort of heathen revival took place, for even the ministers and<lb>
deacons turned Muselemen; old ladies tossed bean-bags till<lb>
their caps were awry, and winter roses blossomed on their<lb>
cheeks; school-children proved the worth of the old proverb,<lb>
&ldquo;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,&rdquo; by<lb>
getting their backs ready before the burdens came; pale girls<lb>
grew blithe and strong swinging their dumb namesakes; and<lb>
jolly lads marched to and fro embracing clubs as if longevity<lb>
were corked up in those wooden bottles, and they all took<lb>
&ldquo;modest quenchers&rdquo; by the way.</p>
<p>August Bopp, the new leader of the class, was a German<lb>
possessing but a small stock of English, though a fine gymnast;<lb>
and, being also a bashful man, the appointed moment<lb>
had no sooner arrived than he found his carefully prepared<lb>

<figdesc>Page 034.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sentences slipping away from his memory as the ice appears<lb>
to do from under unhappy souls first mounted upon skates.<lb>
An awful silence reigned; Mr. Bopp glanced nervously<lb>
over his shoulder at the staring rows, more appalling in their<lb>
stillness than if they had risen up and hooted at him, then<lb>
piling up the bags for the seventh time, he gave himself a<lb>
mental shake, and, with a crimson visage, was about to<lb>
launch his first &ldquo;Ladees und gentlemen,&rdquo; when the door<lb>
opened, and a small, merry-faced figure appeared, looking<lb>
quite at ease in the novel dress, as, with a comprehensive<lb>
nod, it marched straight across the hall to its place among<lb>
the weaker vessels.</p>
<p>A general glance of approbation followed from the gentlemen's<lb>
side, a welcoming murmur ran along the ladies', and<lb>
the fifty pairs of eyes changed their focus for a moment.<lb>
Taking advantage of which, Mr. Bopp righted himself, and<lb>
burst out with a decided, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladees und gentlemen: the time have arrived that we<lb>
shall begin. Will the gentlemen serve the ladees to a wand,<lb>
each one, then spread theirselves about the hall, and follow<lb>
the motions I will make as I shall count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes of chaos, then all fell into order, and nothing<lb>
was heard but the leader's voice and the stir of many<lb>
bodies moving simultaneously. An uninitiated observer would<lb>
have thought himself in Bedlam; for as the evening wore on,<lb>
the laws of society seemed given to the winds, and humanity<lb>
gone mad. Bags flew in all directions, clubs hurtled<lb>
through the air, and dumb-bells played a castinet accompaniment<lb>
to peals of laughter that made better music than<lb>
any band. Old and young gave themselves up to the universal<lb>
merriment, and, setting dignity aside, played like happy-hearted<lb>
children for an hour. Stout Dr. Quackenboss<lb>
gasped twice round the hall on one toe; stately Mrs.<lb>

Primmins ran like a girl of fifteen to get her pins home before<lb>
her competitor; Tommy Inches, four feet three, trotted<lb>
away with Deacon Stone on his shoulder, while Mr. Steepleton<lb>
and Miss Maypole hopped together like a pair of lively<lb>
young ostriches, and Ned Amandine, the village beau, blew<lb>
arrows through a pop-gun, like a modern Cupid in pegtops<lb>
instead of pinions.</p>
<p>The sprightly young lady whose entrance had been so opportune<lb>
seemed a universal favorite, and was overwhelmed<lb>
with invitations to &ldquo;bag,&rdquo; &ldquo;hop,&rdquo; and &ldquo;blow&rdquo; from the<lb>
gentlemen who hovered about her, cheerfully distorting themselves<lb>
to the verge of dislocation in order to win a glance of<lb>
approbation from the merry black eyes which were the<lb>
tapers where all these muscular moths singed their wings.<lb>
Mr. Bopp had never seen such a little piece of earnestness<lb>
before, and began to think the young lady must be training<lb>
for a boat-race or the ring. Her dumb-bells flew about till a<lb>
pair of white arms looked like the sails of a windmill; she<lb>
hit out from the shoulder with a vigor that would have done<lb>
execution had there been anything but empty air to &ldquo;punish;&rdquo;<lb>
and the &ldquo;one, two, three!&rdquo; of the Zouave movement<lb>
went off with a snap; while the color deepened from pink<lb>
to scarlet in her cheeks, the black braids tumbled down upon<lb>
her shoulders, and the clasp of her belt flew asunder; but<lb>
her eye seldom left the leader's face, and she followed every<lb>
motion with an agility and precision quite inspiring. Mr.<lb>
Bopp's courage rose as he watched her, and a burning desire<lb>
to excel took possession of him, till he felt as if his muscles<lb>
were made of India-rubber, and his nerves of iron. He<lb>
went into his work heart and soul, shaking a brown mane<lb>
out of his eyes, issuing commands like a general at the head<lb>
of his troops, and keeping both interest and fun in full blast<lb>
till people laughed who had not laughed heartily for years;<lb>

lungs got their fill for once, unsuspected muscles were suddenly<lb>
developed, and, when the clock struck ten, all were<lb>
bubbling over with that innocent jollity which makes youth<lb>
worth possessing, and its memory the sunshine of old age.</p>
<p>The last exercise was drawing to a close, and a large ring<lb>
of respectable members of society were violently sitting<lb>
down and rising up in a manner which would have scandalized<lb>
Miss Wilhelmina Carolina Amelia S. Keggs to the last<lb>
degree, when Mr. Bopp was seen to grow very pale, and<lb>
drop in a manner which it was evident his pupils were not<lb>
expected to follow.</p>
<p>At this unexpected performance, the gentlemen took advantage<lb>
of their newly-acquired agility to fly over all obstacles<lb>
and swarm on to the platform, while the ladies successfully<lb>
lessened their unusual bloom by staring wildly at one<lb>
another and suggesting awful impossibilities. The bustle<lb>
subsided as suddenly as it arose; and Mr. Bopp, rather damp<lb>
about the head and dizzy about the eye, but quite composed,<lb>
appeared, saying, with the broken English and appealing<lb>
manner which caused all the ladies to pronounce him &ldquo;a<lb>
dear&rdquo; on the spot, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will excoose me for making this lesson to be<lb>
more short than it should; but I have exercise nine hours<lb>
this day, and being just got well from a illness, I have not<lb>
recover the strength I have lost. Next week I shall be able<lb>
to take time by the hair, so that I will not have so much engagements<lb>
in one day. I thank you for your kindness, and<lb>
say good-efening.</p>
<p>After a round of applause, as a last vent for their spirits,<lb>
the class dispersed, and Mr. Bopp was wrestling with a<lb>
vicious pin as he put on his collar (&ldquo;a sure sign he has no<lb>
ma to see to his buttons, poor lamb!&rdquo; thought Mrs. Fairbairn,<lb>
watching him from afar); when the sprightly young lady,<lb>
<pb n="037">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-038">

<figdesc>Page 037.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
accompanied by a lad the masculine image of herself, appeared<lb>
upon the platform, saying, with an aspect as cordial<lb>
as her words, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Professor. Allow me to introduce my<lb>
brother and myself, Dick and Dolly Ward, and ask you in<lb>
my mother's name, to come home with us; for the tavern is<lb>
not a cosy place, and after all this exertion you should be<lb>
made comfortable. Please come, for Dr. Turner always<lb>
stayed with us, and we promised to do the honors of the<lb>
town to any gentleman he might send to supply his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we did; and mother is probably freezing her<lb>
blessed nose off watching for us; so don't disappoint her,<lb>
Bopp. It's all settled, the sleigh's at the door, and here's<lb>
your coat; so, come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was a fine sample of young America in its best aspect,<lb>
and would have said &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; to Louis Napoleon<lb>
if he had been at hand, and have done it so heartily<lb>
that the great Frenchman would have found it hard to resist<lb>
giving as frank an answer. Therefore no wonder that Mr.<lb>
Bopp surrendered at once; for the young gentleman took<lb>
possession of him bodily, and shook him into his coat with<lb>
an amiable impetuosity which developed a sudden rent in the<lb>
well-worn sleeve thereof, and caused an expression of dismay<lb>
to dawn upon the owner's countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon; never mind; mother'll sew you up in two<lb>
seconds, and your overcoat will hide the damage. Where is<lb>
it? I'll get it, and then we'll be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp colored distressfully, looked up, looked down,<lb>
and then straight into the lad's face, saying simply,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; I haf no coat but one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick opened his eyes, and was about opening his mouth<lb>
also, for the exit of some blunderingly good-natured reply,<lb>
when a warning poke from his sister restrained him, while<lb>

Dolly, with the innocent hypocrisy which is as natural to<lb>
some women as the art of tying bows, said, as she led the<lb>
way out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the worth of gymnastics, Dick, in this delightful<lb>
indifference to cold. I sincerely hope we may reach a<lb>
like enviable state of health, and look upon great-coats as<lb>
effeminate, and mufflers a weakness of the flesh. Do you<lb>
think we shall, Mr. Bopp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head with a perceptible shiver as the keen<lb>
north wind smote him in the face, but answered, with a look<lb>
half merry, half sad,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not choice, but what you call necessitee, with me;<lb>
and I truly hope you may never haf to exercise to keep life<lb>
in you when you haf sold your coat to pay a doctor's bill, or<lb>
teach the art of laughing while your heart is heavy as one<lb>
stone. You would not like that, I think, yet it is good, too;<lb>
for small things make much happiness for me, and a kind<lb>
word is often better than a rix dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in the young man's tone and manner<lb>
which touched and won his hearers at once. Dolly secretly<lb>
resolved to put an extra blanket on his bed, and shower kind<lb>
words upon him, while Dick tucked him up in buffalo robes<lb>
where he sat helplessly beaming down upon the red hood at<lb>
his side.</p>
<p>A roaring fire shone out hospitably as they came, and<lb>
glorified the pleasant room, dancing on ancient furniture and<lb>
pictured walls till the jolly old portraits seemed to wink a<lb>
visible welcome. A cheery-faced little woman, like an elder<lb>
Dolly, in a widow's cap, stood on the threshold, with a<lb>
friendly greeting for the stranger, which warmed him as no<lb>
fire could have done.</p>
<p>If August Bopp had been an Englishman, he would have<lb>
felt much, but said less on that account; if he had been an<lb>

</eaffig>
American, he would have tried to conceal his poverty, and<lb>
impress the family with his past grandeur, present importance,<lb>
or future prospects; being a German, he showed exactly<lb>
what he was, with the childlike frankness of his race.<lb>
Having had no dinner, he ate heartily of what was offered<lb>
him; being cold, he basked in the generous warmth; being<lb>
homesick and solitary, he enjoyed the genial influences that<lb>
surrounded him, and told his story, sure of sympathy; for<lb>
even in prosaic Yankeedom he had found it, as travellers<lb>
find Alpine flowers among the snow.</p>
<p>It was a simple story of a laborious boyhood, being early<lb>
left an orphan, with a little sister dependent on him, till an<lb>
opening in America tempted him to leave her and come to<lb>
try and earn a home for her and for himself. Sickness, misfortune,<lb>
and disappointment had been his companions for a<lb>
year; but he still worked, still hoped, and waited for the happy<lb>
hour when little Ulla should come to him across the sea.<lb>
This was all; yet as he told it, with the magical accompaniments<lb>
of gesture, look, and tone, it seemed full of pathos<lb>
and romance to his listeners, whose faces proved their interest<lb>
more flatteringly than their words.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ward mended the torn coat with motherly zeal, and<lb>
gave it many of those timely stitches which thrifty women<lb>
love to sew. The twins devoted themselves to their guest,<lb>
each in a characteristic manner. Dick, as host, offered every<lb>
article of refreshment the house afforded, goaded the fire to a<lb>
perpetual roar, and discussed gymnastics, with bursts of boyish<lb>
admiration for the grace and skill of his new leader,<lb>
whom he christened King of Clubs on the spot. Dolly made<lb>
the stranger one of them at once by talking bad German, as<lb>
an offset to his bad English, called him Professor in spite of<lb>
all denials, and unconsciously symbolized his future bondage<lb>

by giving him a tangled skein to hold for the furtherance of<lb>
her mother's somewhat lengthened job.</p>
<p>The Cupid of the present day was undoubtedly &ldquo;raised&rdquo;<lb>
in Connecticut; for the ingenuity and shrewdness of that<lb>
small personage could have sprung from no other soil. In<lb>
former times his stratagems were of the romantic order.<lb>
Colin bleated forth his passion in rhyme, and cast sheep's<lb>
eyes from among his flock, while Phyllis coquetted with her<lb>
crook and stuck posies in his hat; royal Ferdinand and<lb>
Miranda played at chess; Ivanhoe upset his fellow-men like<lb>
ninepins for love of lackadaisical Rowena; and &ldquo;sweet<lb>
Moll&rdquo; turned the pages while her lover, Milton, sang. But<lb>
in our day the jolly little god, though still a heathen in the<lb>
severe simplicity of his attire, has become modernized in his<lb>
arts, and invented huskings, apple-bees, sleigh-rides, &ldquo;dropins,&rdquo;<lb>
gymnastics, and, among his finer snares, the putting on<lb>
of skates, drawing of patterns, and holding skeins, &mdash; the<lb>
last-named having superior advantages over the others, as all<lb>
will testify who have enjoyed one of those hand-to-hand skirmishes.<lb>
</p>
<p>August Bopp was three and twenty, imaginative, grateful,<lb>
and heart-whole; therefore, when he found himself sitting opposite<lb>
a blooming little damsel, with a head, bound by a<lb>
pretty red snood, bent down before him, and very close to his<lb>
own a pair of distracting hands, every finger of which had a<lb>
hit to make, and made it, it is not to be denied that he felt<lb>
himself entering upon a new and very agreeable experience.<lb>
Where could he look but in the face opposite, sometimes so<lb>
girlishly merry and sometimes so beautifully shy? It was a<lb>
winning face, full of smooth curves, fresh colors, and sunshiny<lb>
twinkles, &mdash; a face every one liked, for it was as changeful as<lb>
an April day, and always pleasant, whether mischievous,<lb>
mournful, or demure.</p>

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Like one watching a new picture, Mr. Bopp inspected<lb>
every feature of the countenance so near his own; and, as<lb>
his admiration &ldquo;grew by what it fed on,&rdquo; he fell into a<lb>
chronic state of stammer and blush; for the frank eyes were<lb>
very kind, the smooth cheeks reflected a pretty shade of his<lb>
own crimson, and the smiling lips seemed constantly suggesting,<lb>
with mute eloquence, that they were made for kissing,<lb>
while the expressive hands picked at the knots till the Professor<lb>
felt like a very resigned fly in the web of a most enticing<lb>
young spider.</p>
<p>If the King of Clubs saw a comely face, the Queen of<lb>
Hearts saw what observing girls call a &ldquo;good face;&rdquo; and<lb>
with a womanly respect for strength, the manliest attribute of<lb>
man, she admired the broad shoulders and six feet one of her<lb>
new master. This face was not handsome, for, true to his<lb>
fatherland, the Professor had an eminent nose, a blonde beard,<lb>
and a crop of &ldquo;bonny brown hair&rdquo; long enough to have been<lb>
gathered into a ribbon, as in the days of Schiller and Jean<lb>
Paul; but Dolly liked it, for its strength was tempered with<lb>
gentleness; patience and courage gave it dignity, and the<lb>
glance that met her own was both keen and kind.</p>
<p>The silk was wound at last, the coat repaired. Dick with<lb>
difficulty concealed the growing stiffness of his shoulders,<lb>
while Dolly turned up the lamp, which bluntly hinted bed-time,<lb>
and Mrs. Ward successfully devoured six gapes behind<lb>
her hand, but was detected in the seventh by Mr. Bopp, who<lb>
glanced at the clock, stopped in the middle of a sentence,<lb>
and, with a hurried &ldquo;goot-night,&rdquo; made for the door without<lb>
the least idea whither he was going. Piloted by Dick, he<lb>
was installed in the &ldquo;best chamber,&rdquo; where his waking<lb>
dreams were enlivened by a great fire, and his sleeping ones<lb>
by an endless succession of skeins, each rapturously concluded<lb>
<pb n="042">

</eaffig>
in the style of Sam Weller when folding carpets with the<lb>
pretty maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Dolly, it won't do, and I'm not going to have<lb>
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed; and how will you help it, you absurd boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you don't stop it, I'll just say to Bopp, &mdash;<lb>
`Look here, my dear fellow; this sister of mine is a capital<lb>
girl, but she will flirt and' &rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it's a family failing, Dick,&rdquo; cut in Dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. I shall say, `Take care of your heart,<lb>
Bopp, for she has a bad habit of playing battle-door and<lb>
shuttle-cock with these articles; and, though it may be very<lb>
good fun for a time, it makes them ache when they get a last<lb>
knock and are left to lie in a corner.' &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What eloquence! But you'd never dare to try it on Mr.<lb>
Bopp; and I shouldn't like to predict what would happen to<lb>
you if you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say `dare,' I'll do it the first minute I see him.<lb>
As for consequences, I don't care that for 'em;&rdquo; and Dick<lb>
snapped his fingers with an aspect of much disdain. But<lb>
something in his sister's face suggested the wisdom of moderation,<lb>
and moved him to say, less like a lord of creation,<lb>
and more like a brother who privately adored his sister, but<lb>
of course was not going to acknowledge such a weakness, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but soberly, now, I wish you wouldn't plague<lb>
Bopp; for it's evident to me that he is hit; and from the way<lb>
you've gone on these two months, what else was to be expected?<lb>
Now, as the head of the family, &mdash; you needn't<lb>
laugh, for I am, &mdash; I think I ought to interfere; and so I put<lb>
it to you, &mdash; do you like him, and will you have him? or are<lb>
<pb n="043">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-044">

<figdesc>Page 043.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
you merely amusing yourself, as you have done ever since<lb>
you were out of pinafores? If you like him, all serene.<lb>
I'd rather have him for a brother than any one I know, for<lb>
he's a regular trump though he <hi rend="italics">is</hi> poor; but if you don't, I<lb>
won't have the dear old fellow floored just because you like to<lb>
see it done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may here be remarked that Dolly quite glowed to hear<lb>
her brother praise Mr. Bopp, and that she indorsed every<lb>
word with mental additions of double warmth; but Dick had<lb>
begun all wrong, and, manlike, demanded her confidence before<lb>
she had made up her mind to own she had any to bestow;<lb>
therefore nothing came of it but vexation of spirit; for it is a<lb>
well-known fact that, on some subjects, if boys will tease,<lb>
girls will fib, and both maintain that it is right. So Dolly<lb>
whetted her feminine weapon, and assumed a lofty superiority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! what a sudden spasm of virtue; and why, if<lb>
it is such a sin, has not the `head of the house' taken his<lb>
sister to task before, instead of indulging in a like degeneracy,<lb>
and causing several interesting persons to tear their<lb>
hair, and bewail his forgetfulness, when they ought to have<lb>
blessed their stars he was out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick snowballed a dozing crow and looked nettled; for he<lb>
had attained that age when &ldquo;Tom Brown at Oxford&rdquo; was<lb>
the book of books, the twelfth chapter being the favorite,<lb>
and five young ladies having already been endowed with the<lb>
significant heliotrope flower; all of which facts Dolly had<lb>
skilfully brought to mind, as a return-shot for his somewhat<lb>
personal remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! they were only girls, and it don't amount to anything<lb>
among us young folks; but Bopp is a grown man, and<lb>
you ought to respect him too much to play such pranks with<lb>
him. Besides, he's a German, and more tender-hearted than<lb>
we rough Yankees, as any one can see by the way he acts<lb>
<pb n="044">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-045">

<figdesc>Page 044.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
when you snub him. He is proud, too, for all his meekness,<lb>
and waits till he's sure you like him before he says anything;<lb>
and he'll need the patience of a family of Jobs at the rate<lb>
you're going on, &mdash; a honey-pot one day and a pickle-jar the<lb>
next. Do make up your mind, and say yes or no, right off,<lb>
Dolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have me meet him at the door with a meek<lb>
courtesy, and say, `Oh, if you please, I'm ready to say<lb>
Yes, thank you, if you'll be good enough to say, Will you'?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be a goose, child; you know I mean nothing of<lb>
the kind; only you girls never will do anything straight<lb>
ahead if you can dodge and fuss and make a mess of it. Just<lb>
tell me one thing: Do you, or don't you, like old Bopp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an elegant way to put it! Of course I like him<lb>
well enough as a leader; he is clever, and sort of cunning,<lb>
and I enjoy his funny ways; but what in the world should I<lb>
do with a great yellow-haired laddie who could put me in his<lb>
pocket, and yet is so meek that I should never find the heart<lb>
to henpeck him? You are welcome to him; and since you<lb>
love him so much, there's no need of my troubling myself on<lb>
his account; for with you for a friend, he can have no earthly<lb>
wish ungratified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't try to be cutting, Dolly, because you look homely<lb>
when you do, and it's a woman's business to be pretty always.<lb>
All I've got to say is, you will be in a nice state of<lb>
mind if you damage Bopp; for every one likes him, and will<lb>
be down upon you for a heartless little wretch; and I shan't<lb>
blame them, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the town wouldn't put its fingers in other people's<lb>
pies, and you may tell it so, with my compliments; and all <hi rend="italics">I</hi><lb>
have to say is, that you men have more liberty than you know<lb>
what to do with, and we women haven't enough; so it's perfectly<lb>
fair that we should show you the worth of the thing by<lb>

taking it away now and then. I shall do exactly as I please;<lb>
dance, walk, ride, and flirt, whenever and with whomever I<lb>
see fit; and the whole town, with Mr. Dick Ward at their<lb>
head, can't stop me if I choose to go on. Now, then, what<lb>
next?&rdquo; After which declaration of independence, Dolly<lb>
folded her arms, wheeled about and faced her brother, a<lb>
spirited statuette of Self Will, in a red hood and mittens.</p>
<p>Dick sternly asked, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your firm decision, ma'am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will not give up your nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure you don't care for Bopp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could slap him with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. I shall see that you don't get a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't try a skirmish, for you'll get beaten, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll prove that, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the belligerents loftily paced up the lawn, with their<lb>
purpose so well expressed by outward signs that Mrs. Ward<lb>
knew, by the cock of Dick's hat and the decided tap of<lb>
Dolly's heels, that a storm was brewing, before they entered<lb>
the door.</p>
<p>This fraternal conversation took place some two months<lb>
from the evening of Mr. Bopp's advent, as the twins were<lb>
strolling home from school, which school must be briefly alluded<lb>
to in order to explain the foregoing remarks. It was<lb>
an excellent institution in all respects; for its presiding genius<lb>
stood high in the townfolks' esteem, and might have served<lb>
as an example to Dr. Watts' &ldquo;busy bee,&rdquo; in the zeal with<lb>
which he improved his &ldquo;shining hours,&rdquo; and laid up honey<lb>
against the winter, which many hoped would be long in coming.<lb>
All manner of aids were provided for sprouting souls<lb>
<pb n="046">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-047">

<figdesc>Page 046.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and bodies, diversions innumerable, and society, some members<lb>
of which might have polished off Alcibiades <hi rend="italics">a la</hi> Secrates,<lb>
or entertained Plato with &ldquo;&aelig;sthetic tea.&rdquo; But, sad<lb>
to relate, in spite of all these blessings, the students who resorted<lb>
to this academy possessed an Adam-and-Eve-like proclivity<lb>
for exactly what they hadn't got and didn't need; and,<lb>
not contented with the pleasures provided, must needs play<lb>
truant with that young scamp Eros, and turn the ancient<lb>
town topsy-turvy with modern innovations, till scandalized<lb>
spinsters predicted that the very babies would catch the fever,<lb>
refuse their panada in jealous gloom, send billet-doux in their<lb>
rattles, elope in wicker-carriages, and set up housekeeping in<lb>
dolls' houses, after the latest fashion.</p>
<p>Certain inflammable Southerners introduced the new game,<lb>
and left such romantic legends of their loves behind them that<lb>
their successors were fired with an ambition to do the like,<lb>
and excel in all things, from cricket to captivation.</p>
<p>This state of things is not to be wondered at; for America,<lb>
being renowned as a &ldquo;fast&rdquo; nation, has become a sort of hotbed,<lb>
and seems to force humanity into early bloom. Therefore,<lb>
past generations must not groan over the sprightly<lb>
present, but sit in the chimney-corner and see boys and girls<lb>
play the game which is too apt to end in a checkmate for one<lb>
of the players. To many of the lookers-on, the new order of<lb>
things was as good as a puppet-show; for, with the enthusiasm<lb>
of youth, the actors performed their parts heartily, forgetting<lb>
the audience in their own earnestness. Bless us! what revolutions<lb>
went on under the round jackets, and what love-tokens<lb>
lay in the pockets thereof. What plots and counterplots occupied<lb>
the heads that wore the innocent-looking snoods, and<lb>
what captives were taken in the many-colored nets that would<lb>
come off and have to be taken care of. What romances blossomed<lb>
like dandelions along the road to school, and what tales<lb>

the river might have told if any one could have learned its<lb>
musical speech. How certain gates were glorified by daily<lb>
lingerings thereat, and what tender memories hung about<lb>
dingy desks, old pens, and books illustrated with all manner<lb>
of symbolical designs.</p>
<p>Let those laugh who will; older and wiser men and women<lb>
might have taken lessons of these budding heroes and heroines;<lb>
for here all was honest, sincere, and fresh; the old<lb>
world had not taught them falsehood, self-interest, or mean<lb>
ambitions. When they lost or won, they frankly grieved or<lb>
rejoiced, and wore no masks except in play, and then got them<lb>
off as soon as possible. If blue-eyed Lizzie frowned, or went<lb>
home with Joe, Ned, with a wisdom older lovers would do well<lb>
to imitate, went in for another game of foot-ball, gave the rejected<lb>
apple to little Sally, and whistled &ldquo;Glory Hallelujah,&rdquo;<lb>
instead of &ldquo;Annie Laurie,&rdquo; which was better than blowing<lb>
a rival's brains out, or glowering at woman-kind forever after.<lb>
Or, when Tom put on Clara's skates three successive days,<lb>
and danced with her three successive evenings, leaving Kitty<lb>
to freeze her feet in the one instance and fold her hands in<lb>
the other, she just had a &ldquo;good cry,&rdquo; gave her mother an extra<lb>
kiss, and waited till the recreant Tom returned to his allegiance,<lb>
finding his little friend a sweetheart in nature as in<lb>
name.</p>
<p>Dick and Dolly were foremost in the ranks, and expert in<lb>
all the new amusements. Dick worshipped at many shrines,<lb>
but most faithfully at that of a meek divinity, who returned<lb>
charming answers to the ardent epistles which he left in her<lb>
father's garden wall, where, Pyramus and Thisbe-like, they<lb>
often chatted through a chink; and Dolly was seldom seen<lb>
without a staff of aids who would have &ldquo;fought, bled, and<lb>
died&rdquo; for her as cheerfully as the Little Corporal's Old<lb>
<pb n="048">

</eaffig>
Guard, though she paid them only in words; for her Waterloo<lb>
had not yet come.</p>
<p>With the charming perversity of her sex in such matters,<lb>
no sooner had Dolly declared that she didn't like Mr. Bopp,<lb>
than she began to discover that she did; and so far from desiring<lb>
&ldquo;to slap him,&rdquo; a tendency to regard him with peculiar<lb>
good-will and tenderness developed itself, much to her own<lb>
surprise; for with all her coquetry and seeming coldness,<lb>
Dolly had a right womanly heart of her own, though she had<lb>
never acknowledged the fact till August Bopp looked at her<lb>
with so much love and longing in his honest eyes. Then she<lb>
found a little fear mingling with her regard, felt a strong desire<lb>
to be respected by him, discovered a certain something<lb>
which she called conscience, restraining a reckless use of her<lb>
power, and, soon after her lofty denial to Dick, was forced to<lb>
own that Mr. Bopp had become her master in the finer species<lb>
of gymnastics that came in with Adam and Eve, and have<lb>
kept all creation turning somersets ever since. Of course<lb>
these discoveries were unconfessed, even to that best bosom<lb>
friend which any of us can have; yet her mother suspected<lb>
them, and, with much anxiety, saw all, yet held her peace,<lb>
knowing that her little daughter would, sooner or later, give<lb>
her a fuller confidence than could be demanded; and remembering<lb>
the happiest moments of her own happy past, when an<lb>
older Dick wooed another Dolly, she left that flower, which<lb>
never can be forced, to open at its own sweet will.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bopp, though carrying his heart upon his<lb>
sleeve, believed his secret buried in the deepest gloom, and<lb>
enjoyed all the delightful miseries lovers insist upon making<lb>
for themselves. When Dolly was quiet and absent, he<lb>

<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-050">

<figdesc>Page 049.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="4">
became pensive, the lesson dragged, and people fancied they<lb>
were getting tired of the humbug; when Dolly was blithe<lb>
and bland, he grew radiant, exercised within an inch of his<lb>
life as a vent for his emotions, and people went home declaring<lb>
gymnastics to be the crowning triumph of the age;<lb>
and when Dolly was capricious, Mr. Bopp became a bewildered<lb>
weathercock, changing as the wind changed, and dire<lb>
was the confusion occasioned thereby.</p>
<p>Like the sage fowl in the story, Dick said nothing, but<lb>
&ldquo;kept up a terrible thinking,&rdquo; and, not having had experience<lb>
enough to know that when a woman says No she is very<lb>
apt to mean Yes, he took Dolly at her word. Believing it<lb>
to be his duty to warn &ldquo;Old Bopp,&rdquo; he resolved to do it<lb>
like a Roman brother, regardless of his own feelings or his<lb>
sister's wrath, quite unconscious that the motive power in the<lb>
affair was a boyish love of ruling the young person who<lb>
ruled every one else.</p>
<p>Matters stood thus, when the town was electrified by a<lb>
general invitation to the annual jubilee at Jollyboys Hall,<lb>
which this spring flowered into a masquerade, and filled the<lb>
souls of old and young with visions of splendor, frolic, and<lb>
fun. Being an amiable old town, it gave itself up, like a<lb>
kind grandma, to the wishes of its children, let them put its<lb>
knitting away, disturb its naps, keep its hands busy with<lb>
vanities of the flesh, and its mind in a state of chaos for<lb>
three mortal weeks. Young ladies were obscured by tarletan<lb>
fogs, behind which they concocted angels' wings, newspaper<lb>
gowns, Minnehaha's wampum, and Cinderella's slippers. Inspired<lb>
but incapable boys undertook designs that would have<lb>
daunted a costumer of the first water, fell into sloughs of<lb>
despond, and, emerging, settled down from peers and paladins<lb>
into jovial tars, friar waterproofs, and officers in miscellaneous<lb>
uniforms. Fathers laughed or grumbled at the<lb>

whole thing and advanced pecuniary loans with good or ill<lb>
grace, as the case might be; but the mothers, whose interest<lb>
in their children's pleasure is a sort of evergreen that no<lb>
snows of time can kill, sewed spangles by the bushel, made<lb>
wildernesses of tissue-paper blossom as the rose, kept tempers<lb>
sweet, stomachs full, and domestic machinery working<lb>
smoothly through it all, by that maternal magic which makes<lb>
them the human providences of this naughty world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I go as?&rdquo; was the universal cry. Garrets<lb>
were taken by storm, cherished relics were teased out of old<lb>
ladies' lavendered chests (happy she who saw them again!),<lb>
hats were made into boots, gowns into doublets, cloaks into<lb>
hose, Sunday bonnets despoiled of their plumage, silken cauliflowers<lb>
sown broadcast over the land, and cocked-up caps<lb>
erected in every style of architecture, while &ldquo;Tag, Rag, and<lb>
Bobtail&rdquo; drove a smashing business, and everybody knew<lb>
what everybody else was going to be, and solemnly vowed<lb>
they didn't &mdash; which transparent falsehood was the best joke<lb>
of the whole.</p>
<p>Dolly allowed her mates to believe she was to be the<lb>
Queen of Hearts, but privately laid hold of certain brocades<lb>
worn by a trim grandmother half a century ago, and one<lb>
evening burst upon her brother in a charming &ldquo;Little BoPeep&rdquo;<lb>
costume, which, for the benefit of future distressed<lb>
damsels, may be described as a white silk skirt, scarlet overdress,<lb>
&ldquo;neatly bundled up behind,&rdquo; as ancient ladies expressed<lb>
it, blue hose with red clocks, high-heeled shoes with<lb>
silver buckles, a nosegay in the trucker, and a fly-way hat<lb>
perched in this case on the top of black curls, which gave<lb>
additional archness to Dolly's face as she entered, singing<lb>
that famous ditty.</p>
<p>Dick surveyed her with approval, turning her about like a<lb>
lay figure, and expressing his fraternal opinion that she was<lb>
<pb n="051">

</eaffig>
&ldquo;the sauciest little turn-out he ever saw,&rdquo; and then wetblanketed<lb>
the remark by adding, &ldquo;Of course you don't call<lb>
it a disguise, do you? and don't flatter yourself that you<lb>
won't be known; for Dolly Ward is as plainly written in<lb>
every curl, bow, and gimcrack, as if you wore a label on<lb>
your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shan't wear it;&rdquo; and off went the hat at one<lb>
fell blow, as Dolly threw her crook in one corner, her posy in<lb>
another, and sat down an image of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don't be a goose, and rip everything to bits; just<lb>
wear a domino over all, as Fan is going to, and then, when<lb>
you've had fun enough, take it off and do the pretty. It<lb>
will make two rigs, you see, and bother the boys to your<lb>
heart's content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, I insist upon kissing you for that brilliant suggestion;<lb>
and then you may run and get me eight yards of<lb>
cambric, just the color of Fan's; but if you tell any one,<lb>
I'll keep her from dancing with you the whole evening;&rdquo;<lb>
with which bribe and threat Dolly embraced her brother, and<lb>
shut the door in his face, while he, putting himself in good<lb>
humor by imagining she was somebody else, departed on his<lb>
muddy mission.</p>
<p>If the ghosts of the first settlers had taken their walks<lb>
abroad on the eventful Friday night, they would have held<lb>
up their shadowy hands at the scenes going on under their<lb>
venerable noses; for strange figures flitted through the quiet<lb>
streets, and instead of decorous slumber, there was decidedly, &mdash;<lb>
</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;A sound of revelry by night.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>Spurs clanked and swords rattled over the frosty ground,<lb>
as if the British were about to make another flying call;<lb>
hooded monks and nuns paced along, on carnal thoughts<lb>
intent; ancient ladies and bewigged gentlemen seemed<lb>

hurrying to enjoy a social cup of tea, and groan over the tax;<lb>
barrels staggered and stuck through narrow ways, as if temperance<lb>
were still among the lost arts, while bears, apes,<lb>
imps, and elves pattered or sparkled by, as if a second Walpurgis<lb>
Night had come, and all were bound for Blocksberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray for the rooster!&rdquo; shouted young Ireland, encamped<lb>
on the sidewalk to see the show, as Mephistopheles'<lb>
red cock's feather skimmed up the stairs, and he left a pink<lb>
domino at the ladies' dressing-room door, with the brief<lb>
warning, &ldquo;Now cut your own capers and leave me to mine,&rdquo;<lb>
adding, as he paused a moment at the great door, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! isn't it a jolly sight, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was; for a mammoth boot stood sentinel at the<lb>
entramce; a Bedouin Arab leaned on his spear in one corner,<lb>
looking as if ready to say, &mdash;<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;Fly to the desert, fly with me,&rdquo;</p></q>
to the pretty Jewess on his arm; a stately Hamlet, with<lb>
irreproachable legs, settled his plumage in another, still undecided<lb>
to which Ophelia he would first address<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;The honey of his music vows.&rdquo;</p></q>
Bluff King Hal's representative was waltzing in a way that<lb>
would have filled that stout potentate with respectful admiration,<lb>
while Queen Katherine flirted with a Fire Zouave. Alcipades<lb>
whisked Mother Goose about the room till the old<lb>
lady's conical hat tottered on her head, and the Union held<lb>
fast to a very little Mac. Flocks of friars, black, white, and<lb>
gray, pervaded the hall, with flocks of ballet girls, intended<lb>
to represent peasants, but failing for lack of drapery; morning<lb>
and evening stars rose or set, as partners willed; lively<lb>
red demons harassed meek nuns, and knights of the Leopard,<lb>
the Lion, or Griffin, flashed by, looking heroically uncomfortable<lb>
in their gilded cages; court ladies promenaded with<lb>

Jack tars, and dukes danced with dairy-maids, while Brother<lb>
Jonathan whittled, Aunt Dinah jabbered, Ingomar flourished<lb>
his club, and every one felt warmly enthusiastic and vigorously<lb>
jolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach himmel! Das ist wunder seh&ouml;n!&rdquo; murmured a tall,<lb>
gray monk, looking in, and quite unconscious that he spoke<lb>
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Bopp! I thought you weren't coming,&rdquo; cried<lb>
Mephistopheles in an emphatic whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I guess you! yes, you are well done. I should<lb>
like to be a Faust for you, but I haf no time, no purse for a<lb>
dress, so I throw this on, and run up for a hour or two.<lb>
Where is &mdash; who is all these people? Do you know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one with the Pope, Fra Diavolo; the telegraph,<lb>
and two knights asking her to dance, is Dolly, if that's what<lb>
you want to know. Go in and keep it up, Bopp, while you<lb>
can; I am off for Fan;&rdquo; and Mephistopheles departed over<lb>
the banisters with a weird agility that delighted the beholders;<lb>
while the gray friar stole into a corner and watched the<lb>
pink domino for half an hour, at the end of which time his<lb>
regards were somewhat confused by discovering that there<lb>
were two pink damsels so like that he could not tell which<lb>
was the one pointed out by Dick and which the new-comer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks I will not know her, but I shall go now and<lb>
find out for myself;&rdquo; and, starting into sudden activity, the<lb>
gray brother strode up to the nearest pink lady, bowed, and<lb>
offered his arm. With a haughty little gesture of denial to<lb>
several others, she accepted it, and they joined the circle of<lb>
many-colored promenaders that eddied round the hall. As<lb>
they went, Mr. Bopp scrutinized his companion, but saw only<lb>
a slender figure shrouded from head to foot, and the tip of a<lb>
white glove resting on his arm.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will speak; then her voice will betray her,&rdquo; he<lb>
thought, forgetting that his own was undisguisable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, permit me that I fan you, it is so greatly<lb>
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fan was surrendered with a bow, and the masked face<lb>
turned fully toward his own, while the hood trembled as if<lb>
its wearer laughed silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is you, &mdash; I know the eyes, the step, the laugh.<lb>
Miss Dolly, did you think you could hide from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not wish to,&rdquo; was the whispered answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think I would come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are not displease with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am very glad; I wanted you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pink head drooped a little nearer, and another white<lb>
glove went to meet its mate upon his arm with a pretty, confiding<lb>
gesture. Mr. Bopp instantly fell into a state of bliss,&mdash;<lb>
the lights, music, gay surroundings, and, more than all,<lb>
this unwonted demonstration, put the crowning glory to the<lb>
moment; and, fired with the hopeful omen, he allowed his<lb>
love to silence his prudence, and lead him to do, then and<lb>
there, the very thing he had often resolved never to do at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss Dolly, if you knew how much, how very<lb>
much you haf enlarged my happiness, and made this efening<lb>
shine for me, you would more often be a little friendly, for<lb>
this winter has been all summer to me, since I knew you and<lb>
your kind home, and now I haf no sorrow but that after the<lb>
next lesson I come no more unless you gif me leaf. See<lb>
now I must say this even here, when so much people are<lb>
about us, because I cannot stop it; and you will forgif me<lb>
that I cannot wait any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bopp, please don't, please stop!&rdquo; began the pink<lb>
<pb n="055">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-056">

<figdesc>Page 055.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
domino in a hurried whisper. But Mr. Bopp was not to be<lb>
stopped. He had dammed up the stream so long, that now<lb>
it rushed on fast, full, and uncontrollable; for, leading her<lb>
into one of the curtained recesses near by, he sat down<lb>
beside her, and, still plying the fan, went on impetuously, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel to say that I lofe you, and tho' I try to kill it, my<lb>
love will not die, because it is more strong than my will,<lb>
more dear than my pride, for I haf much, and I do not ask<lb>
you to be meine Frau till I can gif you more than my heart<lb>
and my poor name. But hear now; I will work, and save,<lb>
and wait a many years if at the end you will take all I haf<lb>
and say, `August, I lofe you.' Do not laugh at me because<lb>
I say this in such poor words; you are my heart's dearest,<lb>
and I must tell it or never come again. Speak to me one<lb>
kind yes, and I will thank Gott in himmel for so much joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pink domino had listened to this rapid speech with<lb>
averted head, and, when it ended, started up, saying eagerly,<lb>
&ldquo;You are mistaken, sir, I am not Dolly;&rdquo; but as she spoke<lb>
her words were belied, for the hasty movement displaced her<lb>
mask, and Mr. Bopp saw Dolly's eyes, a lock of dark hair,<lb>
and a pair of burning cheeks, before the screen was readjusted.<lb>
With redoubled earnestness he held her back,<lb>
whispering, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go mitout the little word, Yes, or No; it is not<lb>
much to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it? Dolly! truly mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let me go at once, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp stood up, saying slowly, &mdash; &ldquo;Yes, go now;<lb>
they told me you had no heart; I beliefe it, and thank you<lb>
for that No;&rdquo; then bowed, and walked straight out of the<lb>
hall, while the pink domino broke into a fit of laughter,<lb>
saying to herself, &mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've done it! I've done it! but what a piece of work<lb>
there'll be to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, who was that tall creature Fan was parading with<lb>
last night? No one knew, and he vanished before the masks<lb>
were taken off,&rdquo; asked Dolly, as she and her brother lounged<lb>
in opposite corners of the sofa the morning after the masquerade,<lb>
&ldquo;talking it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was old Bopp, Mrs. Peep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me! why, he said he wasn't coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People sometimes say what they don't mean, as you may<lb>
have discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn't he come and speak to a body, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better employed, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don't be cross, dear, but tell me all about it, for I<lb>
don't understand how you allowed him to monopolize Fan<lb>
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't bother, I'm sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you're not; you look wicked; I know you've been<lb>
in mischief, and I insist upon hearing all about it, so come<lb>
and `fess' this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dolly proceeded to enforce her command by pulling away<lb>
his pillow and dragging her brother into a sitting posture in<lb>
spite of his laughing resistance and evident desire to exhaust<lb>
her patience; for Dick excelled in teasing, and kept his sister<lb>
in a fidget from morning till night, with occasional fits of<lb>
penitence and petting which lasted till next time. Therefore,<lb>
though dying to `fess,' he was undecided as to the best<lb>
method of executing that task in the manner most aggravating<lb>
to his listener and most agreeable to himself, and sat<lb>
regarding her with twinkling eyes, and his curly pate in a<lb>
<pb n="057">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-058">

<figdesc>Page 057.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
high state of rumple, trying to appear innocently meek, but<lb>
failing signally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, up and tell,&rdquo; commanded Dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won't take my head off till I'm done, I'll<lb>
tell you the best joke of the season. Are you sure the pink<lb>
domino with Bopp wasn't yourself, &mdash; for she looked and<lb>
acted very like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I didn't even know he was there, and<lb>
think it very rude and ungentlemanly in him not to come and<lb>
speak to me. You know it was Fan, so do go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn't, for she changed her mind and wore a<lb>
black domino; I saw her put it on myself. Her Cousin Jack<lb>
came unexpectedly, and she thought if she altered her dress<lb>
and went with him, you wouldn't know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could it have been, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's the mystery, for, do you know, Bopp proposed to<lb>
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn't!&rdquo; and Dolly flew up with a startled look that,<lb>
to adopt a phrase from his own vocabulary, was &ldquo;nuts&rdquo; to<lb>
her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes he did; I heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, where, and how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of these flirtation boxes; they dropped the curtain,<lb>
but I heard him do it, on my honor I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persons of honor don't listen at curtains and key-holes.<lb>
What did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it wasn't honorable to listen, it isn't to hear; so I<lb>
won't tell, though I could not help knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merey! don't stop now, or I shall die with curiosity. I<lb>
dare say I should have done the same; no one minds at such<lb>
a place, you know. But I don't see the joke yet,&rdquo; said<lb>
Dolly dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; and Dick went off into a shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You idiotic boy, take that pillow out of your mouth, and<lb>
tell me the whole thing, &mdash; what he said, what she said, and<lb>
what they both did. It was all fun of course, but I'd like<lb>
to hear about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been fun on her part, but it was solemn earnest<lb>
on his, for he went it strong I assure you. I'd no idea<lb>
the old fellow was so sly, for he appeared smashed with you,<lb>
you know, and there he was finishing up with this unknown<lb>
lady. I wish you could have heard him go on, with tears in<lb>
his eyes&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know if you didn't see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that's only a figure of speech; I thought so<lb>
from his voice. He was ever so tender, and took to Dutch<lb>
when English was too cool for him. It was really touching,<lb>
for I never heard a fellow do it before; and, upon my word,<lb>
I should think it was rather a tough job to say that sort of<lb>
thing to a pretty woman, mask or no mask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; asked Dolly, with her hands pressed<lb>
tight together, and a curious little quiver of the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, No, as short as pie-crust; and when he rushed<lb>
out with his heart broken all to bits apparently, she just burst<lb>
out laughing, and went and polked at a two-forty pace for<lb>
half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora unclasped her hands, took a long breath, and cried<lb>
out, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a wicked, heartless hussy! and if I know her,<lb>
I'll never speak to her again; for if he was really in earnest,<lb>
she ought to be killed for laughing at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ought you, then, for making fun of poor Fisher when<lb>
he went down on his knees behind the huckleberry bushes<lb>
last summer. He was earnest enough, for he looked as<lb>
black-and-blue as his berries when he got home. Your<lb>
theory is all right, ma'am, but your practice is all bosh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue about that silly thing. Boys in college<lb>
think they know everything, can do everything, have<lb>
everything, and only need beckon, and all womankind will<lb>
come and adore. It made a man of him, and he'll thank me<lb>
for taking the sentimental nonsense and conceit out of him.<lb>
You will need just such a lesson at the rate you go on, and I<lb>
hope Fan will give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the lecture is over, I'll go on with the joke, if you<lb>
want to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn't this enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bless you, no! the cream of it is to come. What<lb>
would you give to know who the lady was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars, down, this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, hand 'em over, and I'll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dolly produced her purse, and, bill in hand, sat waiting<lb>
for the disclosure. Dick rose with a melo-dramatic<lb>
bow, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo, it was I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's a great fib, for I saw you flying about the whole<lb>
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw my dress, but I was not in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! who <hi rend="italics">did</hi> I keep going to, then? and what<lb>
<hi rend="italics">did</hi> I do to make a fool of myself, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Purse and bill dropped out of Dolly's hand, and she looked<lb>
at her brother with a distracted expression of countenance.<lb>
Dick rubbed his hands and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's a jolly state of things. Now I'll tell you the<lb>
whole story. I never thought of doing it till I saw Bopp and<lb>
told him who you were; but on my way for Fan I wondered<lb>
if he'd get puzzled between you two; and then a grand idea<lb>
popped into my head to puzzle him myself, for I can take you<lb>
<pb n="060">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-061">

<figdesc>Page 060.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
off to the life. Fan didn't want me to, but I made her, so<lb>
she lent me hoops and gown and the pink domino, and if<lb>
ever I thanked my stars I wasn't tall, I did then, for the<lb>
things fitted capitally as to length, tho' I kept splitting something<lb>
down the back, and scattering hooks and eyes in all directions.<lb>
I wish you could have heard Jack roar while they<lb>
rigged me. He had no dress, so I lent him mine, till just<lb>
before the masks were taken off, when we cut home and<lb>
changed. He told me how you kept running to him to tie up<lb>
your slippers, find your fan, and tell him funny things, thinking<lb>
it was me. I never enjoyed anything so much in my<lb>
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Dolly in a breathless sort of voice, and the<lb>
deluded boy obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew Bopp, and hovered near till he came to find out<lb>
who I was. I took you off in style, and it deceived him, for<lb>
I'm only an inch or two taller than you, and kept my head<lb>
down in the lackadaisical way you girls do; I whispered, so<lb>
my voice didn't betray me; and was very clinging, and<lb>
sweet, and fluttery, and that blessed old goose was sure it<lb>
was you. I thought it was all over once, for when he came<lb>
the heavy in the recess, I got a bit flustered, he was so serious<lb>
about it, my mask slipped, but I caught it, so he only saw my<lb>
eyes and forehead, which are just like yours, and that finished<lb>
him, for I've no doubt I looked as red and silly as you would<lb>
have done in a like fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say No?&rdquo; and Dolly looked as stern as<lb>
fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I say? You told me you wouldn't<lb>
have him, and I thought it would save you the bother of saying<lb>
it, and him the pain of asking twice. I told him some<lb>
time ago that you were a born flirt; he said he knew it; so I<lb>
was surprised to hear him go on at such a rate, but supposed<lb>
<pb n="061">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-062">

<figdesc>Page 061.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
that I was too amiable, and that misled him. Poor old Bopp,<lb>
I kept thinking of him all night, as he looked when he said,<lb>
`They told me you had no heart, now I believe it, and I<lb>
thank you for that No.' It was rather a hard joke for him,<lb>
but it's over now, and he won't have to do it again. You<lb>
said I wouldn't dare tell him about you; didn't I? and<lb>
haven't I won the&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>The rest of the sentence went spinning dizzily through<lb>
Dick's head, as a sudden tingling sensation pervaded his left<lb>
ear, followed by a similar smart in the right; and, for a moment,<lb>
chaos seemed to have come again. Whatever Dolly<lb>
did was thoroughly done: when she danced, the soles of her<lb>
shoes attested the fact; when she flirted, it was warm work<lb>
while it lasted; and when she was angry, it thundered, lightened,<lb>
and blew great guns till the shower came, and the<lb>
whole affair ended in a rainbow. Therefore, being outwitted,<lb>
disappointed, mortified, and hurt, her first impulse was to find<lb>
a vent for these conflicting emotions, and possessing skilful<lb>
hands, she left them to avenge the wrong done her heart,<lb>
which they did so faithfully, that if ever a young gentleman's<lb>
ears were vigorously and completely boxed, Dick was that<lb>
young individual. As the thunder-clap ceased, the gale began<lb>
and blew steadily for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it a joke, do you? I tell you, it's a wicked,<lb>
cruel thing; you've told a lie; you've broken August's<lb>
heart, and made me so angry that I'll never forgive you as<lb>
long as I live. What do you know about my feelings? and<lb>
how dare you take it upon yourself to answer for me? You<lb>
think because we are the same age that I am no older than<lb>
you, but you're mistaken, for a boy of eighteen <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a boy, a<lb>
girl is often a woman, with a woman's hopes and plans; you<lb>
don't understand this any more than you do August's love for<lb>
me, which you listened to and laughed at. I said I didn't<lb>
<pb n="062">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-063">

<figdesc>Page 062.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
like him, and I didn't find out till afterward that I did; then<lb>
I was afraid to tell you lest you'd twit me with it. But now<lb>
I care for no one, and I say I do like him, &mdash; yes, I love him<lb>
with all my heart and soul and might and I'd die this minute<lb>
if I could undo the harm you've done, and see him happy.<lb>
I know I've been selfish, vain, and thoughtless, but I am not<lb>
now; I hoped he'd love me, hoped he'd see I cared for him,<lb>
that I'd done trifling, and didn't mind if he <hi rend="italics">was</hi> poor, for I'd<lb>
enough for both; that I longed to make his life pleasant after<lb>
all his troubles; that I'd send for the little sister he loves so<lb>
well, and never let him suffer any more; for he is so good, so<lb>
patient, so generous, and dear to me, I cannot do enough for<lb>
him. Now it's all spoilt; now I can never tell him this,<lb>
never comfort him in any way, never be happy again all my<lb>
life, and you have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dolly stood before her brother, pouring out her words<lb>
with glittering eyes, impetuous voice, and face pale with passionate<lb>
emotion, he was scared; for as his scattered wits returned<lb>
to him, he felt that he had been playing with edge<lb>
tools, and had cut and slashed in rather a promiscuous manner.<lb>
Dazed and dizzy, he sat staring at the excited figure before<lb>
him, forgetting the indignity he had received, the mistake<lb>
he had made, the damage he had done, in simple wonder at<lb>
the revolutions going on under his astonished eyes. When<lb>
Dolly stopped for breath, he muttered with a contrite look, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm very sorry, &mdash; it was only fun; and I thought it<lb>
would help you both, for how the deuce should I know you<lb>
liked the man when you said you hated him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said that, and if I'd wanted advice I should have<lb>
gone to mother. You men go blundering off with half an<lb>
idea in your heads, and never see your stupidity till you have<lb>
made a mess that can't be mended; we women don't work so,<lb>
but save people's feelings, and are called hypocrites for our<lb>
<pb n="063">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-064">

</eaffig>
pains. I never meant to tell you, but I will now, to show<lb>
you how I've been serving you, while you've been harming<lb>
me: every one of those notes from Fan which you admire so<lb>
much, answer so carefully, and wear out in your pocket,<lb>
though copied by her, were written by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil they were!&rdquo; Up flew Dick, and clapping his<lb>
hand on the left breast-pocket, out came a dozen pink notes<lb>
tied up with a blue ribbon, and much the worse for wear. He<lb>
hastily turned them over as Dolly went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did it, for she didn't know how to answer your<lb>
notes, and came to me. I didn't laugh at them, or make fun<lb>
of her, but helped her silly little wits, and made you a happy<lb>
boy for three months, though you teased me day and night,<lb>
for I loved you, and hadn't the heart to spoil your pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've done it now with a vengeance, and you're a pair<lb>
of deceitful minxes. I've paid <hi rend="italics">you</hi> off. I'll give Fan one<lb>
more note that will keep her eyes red for a month; and I'll<lb>
never love or trust a girl again as long as I live, &mdash; never!<lb>
never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red with wrath, Dick flung the treasured packet into the<lb>
fire, punched it well down among the coals, flung away the<lb>
poker, and turned about with a look and gesture which would<lb>
have been comically tragic if they had not been decidedly<lb>
pathetic, for, in spite of his years, a very tender heart beat<lb>
under the blue jacket, and it was grievously wounded at the<lb>
perfidy of the gentle little divinity whom he worshipped with<lb>
daily increasing ardor. His eyes filled, but he winked resolutely;<lb>
his lips trembled, but he bit them hard; his hands<lb>
doubled themselves up, but he remembered his adversary was<lb>
a woman; and, as a last effort to preserve his masculine dignity,<lb>
he began to whistle.</p>
<p>As if the inconsistencies of womankind were to be shown<lb>
him as rapidly as possible, at this moment the shower came<lb>
<pb n="064">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-065">

<figdesc>Page 064.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
on, for, taking him tenderly about the neck, Dolly fell to<lb>
weeping so infectiously, that, after standing rigidly erect till a<lb>
great tear dropped off the end of his nose, ignominiously announcing<lb>
that it was no go, Dick gave in, and laying his head<lb>
on Dolly's shoulder, the twins quenched their anger, washed<lb>
away their malice, and soothed their sorrow by one of those<lb>
natural processes, so kindly provided for poor humanity, and<lb>
so often despised as a weakness when it might prove a better<lb>
strength than any pride.</p>
<p>Dick cleared up first, with no sign of the tempest but a<lb>
slight mist through which his native sunshine glimmered pensively.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't dear, don't cry so; it will make you sick, and<lb>
won't do any good, for things will come right, or I'll make'<lb>
em, and we'll be comfortable all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we never can be as we were, and it's all my fault.<lb>
I've betrayed Fan's confidence, I've spoiled your little romance,<lb>
I've been a thoughtless, wicked girl, I've lost August;<lb>
and, oh, dear me, I wish I was dead!&rdquo; with which funereal<lb>
climax Dolly cried so despairingly that, like the youngest<lb>
Miss Pecksniff, she was indeed &ldquo;a gushing creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, don't be dismal, and blame yourself for<lb>
every trouble under the sun. Sit down and talk it over, and<lb>
see what can be done. Poor old girl, I forgive you the notes,<lb>
and say I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> wrong to meddle with Bopp. I got you into<lb>
the scrape, and I'll get you out if the sky don't fall, or<lb>
Bopp blow his brains out, like a second Werther, before to-morrow.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>Dick drew the animated fountain to the wide chair, where<lb>
they had sat together since they were born, wiped her eyes,<lb>
laid her wet cheek against his own, and patted her back, with<lb>
an idea that it was soothing to babies, and why not to girls?</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="5">
<p>&ldquo;I wish mother was at home,&rdquo; sighed Dolly, longing for<lb>
that port which was always a haven of refuge in domestic<lb>
squalls like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write, and tell her not to stay till Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it would spoil her visit, and you know she deferred<lb>
it to help us through this dreadful masquerade. But I don't<lb>
know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless your heart, it's simple enough. I'll tell<lb>
Bopp, beg his pardon, say `Dolly's willing,' and there you<lb>
are all taut and ship-shape again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't for the world, Dick. It would be very hard<lb>
for you, very awkward for me, and do no good in the end;<lb>
for August is so proud he'd never forgive you for such a<lb>
trick, would never believe that I `had a heart' after all<lb>
you've said and I've done; and I should only hear with my<lb>
own ears that he thanked me for that No. Oh, why can't<lb>
people know when they are in love, and not go heels over<lb>
head before they are ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that don't suit, I'll let it alone, for that is all I<lb>
can suggest; and if you like your woman's way better, try it,<lb>
only you'll have to fly round, because to-morrow is the last<lb>
night, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan't go, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? we are going to give him the rose-wood set of<lb>
things, have speeches, cheers for the King of Clubs, and no<lb>
end of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't help it; there would be no fun for me, and I<lb>
couldn't look him in the face after all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pooh! yes, you could, or it will be the first time you<lb>
dared not do damage with those wicked eyes of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the first time I ever loved any one.&rdquo; Dolly's voice<lb>
was so low, and her head drooped so much, that this brief<lb>
confession was apparently put away in Dick's pocket, and<lb>
<pb n="066">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-067">

</eaffig>
being an exceedingly novel one, filled that inflammable youth<lb>
with a desire to deposit a similar one in the other pocket,<lb>
which, being emptied of its accustomed contents, left a somewhat<lb>
aching void in itself and the heart underneath. After<lb>
a moment's silence, he said, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won't go, you can settle it when he comes<lb>
here, though I think we should all do better to confess coming<lb>
home in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won't come here again, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't he! that shows you don't know Bopp as well as I.<lb>
He'll come to say good-by, to thank mother for her kindness,<lb>
and you and me for the little things we've done for him (I<lb>
wish I'd left the last undone!), and go away like a gentleman,<lb>
as he is, &mdash; see if he don't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? Then I must see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sure he will, for we men don't bear malice and sulk<lb>
and bawl when we come to grief this way, but stand up and<lb>
take it without winking, like the young Spartan brick when<lb>
the fox was digging into him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, of course, you'll forgive Fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll be hanged if I do,&rdquo; growled Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha! your theory is very good, sir, but your practice<lb>
is bosh,&rdquo; quoted Dolly, with a gleam of the old mischief in<lb>
her face.</p>
<p>Dick took a sudden turn through the room, burst out<lb>
laughing, and came back, saying heartily, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll own up; it is mean to feel so, and I'll think about<lb>
forgiving you both; but she may stop up the hole in the wall,<lb>
for she won't get any more letters just yet; and you may devote<lb>
your epistolary powers to A. Bopp in future. Well,<lb>
what is it? free your mind, and have done with it; but don't<lb>
make your nose red, or take the starch out of my collar with<lb>
any more salt water, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won't; and I only want to say that, as you owe the<lb>
explanation to us both, perhaps it would be best for you to tell<lb>
August your part of the thing as you come home to-morrow,<lb>
and then leave the rest to fate. I can't let him go away<lb>
thinking me such a heartless creature, and once gone it will<lb>
be too late to mend the matter. Can you do this without<lb>
getting me into another scrape, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven't a doubt of it, and I call that sensible. I'll fix<lb>
it capitally, &mdash; go down on my knees in the mud, if it is<lb>
necessary; treat you like eggs for fear of another smash-up;<lb>
and bring him home in such a tip-top state, you'll only have<lb>
to nod and find yourself Mrs. B. any day you like. Now<lb>
let's kiss and be friends, and then go pitch into that pie for<lb>
luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they did, and an hour afterward were rioting in the<lb>
garret under pretence of putting grandma's things away; for<lb>
at eighteen, in spite of love and mischief, boys and girls have<lb>
a spell to exorcise blue devils, and a happy faculty of forgetting<lb>
that &ldquo;the world is hollow, and their dolls stuffed with<lb>
saw-dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was right, for on the following evening, after the lesson,<lb>
Mr. Bopp did go home with him, &ldquo;to say good-by, like a<lb>
gentleman as he was.&rdquo; Dolly got over the first greeting in<lb>
the dusky hall, and as her guest passed on to the parlor, she<lb>
popped her head out to ask anxiously, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say anything, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn't; something has happened to him; he'll tell<lb>
you about it. I'm going to see to the horse, so take your<lb>
time, and do what you like,&rdquo; with which vague information<lb>
Dick vanished, and Dolly wished herself anywhere but where<lb>
she was.</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp sat before the fire, looking so haggard and worn<lb>
out that the girl's conscience pricked her sorely for her part in<lb>
<pb n="068">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-069">

<figdesc>Page 068.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the change, but plucking up her courage, she stirred briskly<lb>
among the tea-cups, asking, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I give you sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I haf no care to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his spiritless mien and sorrowful voice made<lb>
Dolly's eyes fill; but knowing she must depend upon herself<lb>
now, and make the best of her position, she said kindly, yet<lb>
nervously, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look tired; let me do something for you if I can;<lb>
shall I sing for you a little? you once said music rested you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are kind; I could like that I think. Excoose me if<lb>
I am dull, I haf &mdash; yes, a little air if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More and more disturbed by his absent, troubled manner,<lb>
Dolly began a German song he had taught her, but before the<lb>
first line was sung he stopped her with an imploring &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Gott sake not that! I cannot hear it this night; it<lb>
was the last I sung her in the Vaterland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bopp, what is it? Dick says you have a trouble;<lb>
tell me, and let us help you if we can. Are you ill, in want,<lb>
or has any one wronged or injured you in any way? Oh, let<lb>
me help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears had been streaming down Mr. Bopp's cheeks, but as<lb>
she spoke he checked them, and tried to answer steadily, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not ill; I haf no wants now, and no one has<lb>
hurt me but in kindness; yet I haf so great a grief, I could not<lb>
bear it all alone, and so I came to ask a little sympathy from<lb>
your good Mutter, who has been kind to me as if I was a son.<lb>
She is not here, and I thought I would stop back my grief;<lb>
but that moosic was too much; you pity me, and so I tell you.<lb>
See, now! when I find things go bright with me, and haf a<lb>
hope of much work, I take the little store I saved, I send it<lb>
to my friend Carl Hoffman, who is coming from my home,<lb>
and say, `Bring Ulla to me now, for I can make life go well<lb>
<pb n="069">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-070">

<figdesc>Page 069.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to her, and I am hungry till I haf her in my arms again.' I<lb>
tell no one, for I am bold to think that one day I come here<lb>
with her in my hand, to let her thank you in her so sweet way<lb>
for all you haf done for me. Well, I watch the wind, I<lb>
count the days, I haf no rest for joy; and when Carl comes,<lb>
I fly to him. He gifs me back my store, he falls upon my<lb>
neck and does not speak, then I know my little Kind will<lb>
never come, for she has gone to Himmel before I could make<lb>
a home for her on earth. Oh, my Ulla! it is hard to bear;&rdquo;<lb>
and, with a rain of bitter tears, poor Mr. Bopp covered up<lb>
his face and laid it down on his empty plate, as if he never<lb>
cared to lift it up again.</p>
<p>Then Dolly forgot herself in her great sympathy, and,<lb>
going to him, she touched the bent head with a soothing<lb>
hand; let her tears flow to comfort his; and whispered in<lb>
her tenderest voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Bopp, I wish I could heal this sorrow, but as<lb>
I cannot, let me bear it with you; let me tell you how we<lb>
loved the little child, and longed to see her; how we should<lb>
have rejoiced to know you had so dear a friend to make your<lb>
life happy in this strange land; how we shall grieve for your<lb>
great loss, and long to prove our respect and love for you. I<lb>
cannot say this as I ought, but, oh, be comforted, for you will<lb>
see the child again, and, remembering that she waits for you,<lb>
you will be glad to go when God calls you to meet your Ulla<lb>
in that other Fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I will go now! I haf no wish to stay, for all my life<lb>
is black to me. If I had found that other little friend to fill<lb>
her place, I should not grieve so much, because she is weller<lb>
there above than I could make her here; but no; I wait for<lb>
that other one; I save all my heart for her; I send it, but it<lb>
comes back to me; then I know my hope is dead, and I am<lb>
all alone in the strange land.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>There was neither bitterness nor reproach in these broken<lb>
words, only a patient sorrow, a regretful pain, as if he saw<lb>
the two lost loves before him and uttered over them an irrepressible<lb>
lament. It was too much for Dolly and with sudden<lb>
resolution she spoke out fast and low, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bopp, that was a mistake. It was not I you saw<lb>
at the masque; it was Dick. He played a cruel trick; he<lb>
insulted you and wronged me by that deceit, and I find it<lb>
very hard to pardon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! what is that!&rdquo; and Mr. Bopp looked up with<lb>
tears still shining in his beard, and intense surprise in every<lb>
feature of his face.</p>
<p>Dolly turned scarlet, and her heart beat fast as she repeated<lb>
with an unsteady voice, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Dick, not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cloud swept over Mr. Bopp's face, and he knit his brows<lb>
a moment as if Dolly had not been far from right when she<lb>
said &ldquo;he never would forgive the joke.&rdquo; Presently, he<lb>
spoke in a tone she had never heard before, &mdash; cold and<lb>
quiet, &mdash; and in his eye she thought she read contempt for her<lb>
brother and herself, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see now, and I say no more but this; it was not kind<lb>
when I so trusted you. Yet it is well, for you and Richart<lb>
are so one, I haf no doubt he spoke your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a desperate state of things. Dolly had done her<lb>
best, yet he did not, or would not, understand, and, before she<lb>
could restrain them, the words slipped over her tongue, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Dick and I never agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bopp started, swept three spoons and a tea-cup off the<lb>
table as he turned, for something in the hasty whisper reassured<lb>
him. The color sprang up to his cheek, the old warmth<lb>
to his eye, the old erectness to his figure, and the eager accent<lb>
to his voice. He rose, drew Dolly nearer, took her face<lb>
<pb n="071">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-072">

<figdesc>Page 071.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
between his hands, and bending, fixed on her a look tender yet<lb>
masterful, as he said with an earnestness that stirred her as<lb>
words had never done before, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dollee, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> said No! do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> say Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not speak, but her heart stood up in her eyes and<lb>
answered him so eloquently that he was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord, it's all right!&rdquo; thought Dick, as, peeping<lb>
in at the window ten minutes later, he saw Dolly enthroned<lb>
upon Mr. Bopp's knee, both her hands in his, and an<lb>
expression in her April countenance which proved that she<lb>
found it natural and pleasant to be sitting there, with her head<lb>
on the kind heart that loved her; to hear herself called<lb>
<foreign lang="de">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">meine leibchen;</hi>&rdquo;</foreign> to know that she alone could comfort him<lb>
for little Ulla's loss, and fill her empty place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make a very pretty landscape, but too much honey<lb>
isn't good for 'em, so I'll go in, and we'll eat, drink, and be<lb>
merry, in honor of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rattled the latch and tramped on the mat to warn them<lb>
of his approach, and appeared just as Dolly was skimming<lb>
into a chair, and Mr. Bopp picking up the spoons, which he<lb>
dropped again to meet Dick, with a face &ldquo;clear shining after<lb>
rain;&rdquo; and kissing him on both cheeks after the fashion of<lb>
his country, he said, pointing to Dolly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, it is all fine again. I forgif you, and leave all<lb>
blame to that bad spirit, Mephistopheles, who has much<lb>
pranks like that, but never pays one for their pain, as you haf<lb>
me. Heart's dearest, come and say a friendly word to Richart,<lb>
then we will haf a little health, &mdash; Long life and happiness<lb>
to the King of Clubs and the Queen of Hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, August, and as he's to be a farmer, we'll add another, &mdash;<lb>
`Wiser wits and better manners to the Knave of<lb>
Spades.&rdquo;'</p>

</p>
<p>UP the dark stairs that led to his poor home strode a<lb>
gloomy-faced young man with despair in his heart and<lb>
these words on his lips: &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will struggle and suffer no longer; my last hope has<lb>
failed, and life, become a burden, I will rid myself of at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he muttered his stern purpose, he flung wide the door<lb>
and was about to enter, but paused upon the threshold; for<lb>
a glance told him that he had unconsciously passed his own<lb>
apartment and come up higher, till he found himself in a<lb>
room poorer but more cheerful than his own.</p>
<p>Sunshine streamed in through the one small window,<lb>
where a caged bird was blithely singing, and a few flowers<lb>
blossomed in the light. But blither than the bird's song,<lb>
sweeter than the flowers, was the little voice and wan face of<lb>
a child, who lay upon a bed placed where the warmest sunbeams<lb>
fell.</p>
<p>The face turned smiling on the pillow, and the voice said<lb>
pleasantly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, sir, Bess will soon be back if you will wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want nothing of Bess. Who is she and who are you?&rdquo;<lb>
asked the intruder pausing as he was about to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my sister, sir, and I'm `poor Jamie' as they call<lb>
me. But indeed, I am not to be pitied, for I am a happy<lb>
child, though it may not seem so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you lie there? are you sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not sick, though I shall never leave my bed<lb>
<pb n="073">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-074">

<figdesc>Page 073.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
again. See, this is why;&rdquo; and, folding back the covering,<lb>
the child showed his little withered limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you lain here, my poor boy?&rdquo; asked the<lb>
stranger, touched and interested in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you are happy! What in Heaven's name have<lb>
you to render you contented, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come sit beside me, and I'll tell you, sir; that is, if you<lb>
please I should love to talk with you, for it's lonely here<lb>
when Bess is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the child's winning voice, and the influence<lb>
of the cheerful room, calmed the young man's troubled spirit<lb>
and seemed to lighten his despair. He sat down at the bedside<lb>
looking gloomily upon the child, who lay smiling placidly<lb>
as with skilful hands he carved small figures from the bits of<lb>
wood scattered round him on the coverlid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to make you happy, Jamie? Tell me<lb>
your secret, for I need the knowledge very much,&rdquo; said his<lb>
new friend earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all I have dear Bess,&rdquo; and the child's voice lingered<lb>
lovingly upon the name; &ldquo;she is so good, so very good<lb>
to me, no one can tell how much we love each other. All<lb>
day, she sits beside my bed singing to ease my pain, or reading<lb>
while I work; she gives me flowers and birds, and all<lb>
the sunshine that comes in to us, and sits there in the shadow<lb>
that I may be warm and glad. She waits on me all day;<lb>
but when I wake at night, I always see her sewing busily, and<lb>
know it is for me, &mdash; my good kind Bess!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have my work, sir, to amuse me; and it helps a<lb>
little too, for kind children always buy my toys, when Bess<lb>
tells them of the little boy who carved them lying here at<lb>
home while they play out among the grass and flowers where<lb>
he can never be.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="074">

<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-075">

<figdesc>Page 074.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else, Jamie?&rdquo; and the listener's face grew softer<lb>
as the cheerful voice went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my bird, sir, and my roses, I have books, and<lb>
best of all, I have the cross on the old church tower. I can<lb>
see it from my pillow and it shines there all day long, so<lb>
bright and beautiful, while the white doves coo upon the roof<lb>
below. I love it dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked out through the narrow window and<lb>
saw, rising high above the house-tops, like a finger pointing<lb>
heavenward, the old gray tower and the gleaming cross. The<lb>
city's din was far below, and through the summer air the faint<lb>
coo of the doves and the flutter of their wings came down,<lb>
like peaceful country sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you love it, Jamie?&rdquo; he asked, looking at the<lb>
thoughtful face that lit up eagerly as the boy replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it does me so much good, sir. Bess told me<lb>
long ago about the blessed Jesus who bore so much for us,<lb>
and I longed to be as like him as a little child could grow.<lb>
So when my pain was very sharp, I looked up there, and,<lb>
thinking of the things he suffered, tried so hard to bear it<lb>
that I often could; but sometimes when it was too bad, instead<lb>
of fretting Bess, I'd cry softly, looking up there all the<lb>
time and asking him to help me be a patient child. I think<lb>
he did; and now it seems so like a friend to me, I love it<lb>
better every day. I watch the sun climb up along the roofs<lb>
in the morning, creeping higher and higher till it shines upon<lb>
the cross and turns it into gold. Then through the day I<lb>
watch the sunshine fade away till all the red goes from the<lb>
sky, and for a little while I cannot see it through the dark.<lb>
But the moon comes, and I love it better then; for lying<lb>
awake through the long nights, I see the cross so high and<lb>
bright with stars all shining round it, and I feel still and<lb>
happy in my heart as when Bess sings to me in the twilight.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="075">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-076">

<figdesc>Page 075.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when there is no moon, or clouds hide it from you,<lb>
what then, Jamie?&rdquo; asked the young man, wondering if<lb>
there were no cloud to darken the cheerful child's content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wait till it is clear again, and feel that it is there, although<lb>
I cannot see it, sir. I hope it never will be taken<lb>
down, for the light upon the cross seems like that I see in<lb>
dear Bessie's eyes when she holds me in her arms and calls<lb>
me her `patient Jamie.' She never knows I try to bear my<lb>
troubles for her sake, as she bears hunger and cold for mine.<lb>
So you see, sir, how many things I have to make me a happy<lb>
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would gladly lie down on your pillow to be half as<lb>
light of heart as you are, little Jamie, for I have lost my<lb>
faith in everything and with it all my happiness;&rdquo; and the<lb>
heavy shadow which had lifted for a while fell back darker<lb>
than before upon the anxious face beside the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were well and strong like you, sir, I think I should<lb>
be so thankful nothing could trouble me;&rdquo; and with a sigh<lb>
the boy glanced at the vigorous frame and energetic countenance<lb>
of his new friend, wondering at the despondent look<lb>
he wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were poor, so poor you had no means wherewith<lb>
to get a crust of bread, nor a shelter for the night; if you<lb>
were worn-out with suffering and labor, soured by disappointment<lb>
and haunted by ambitious hopes never to be realized,<lb>
what would you do, Jamie?&rdquo; suddenly asked the young man,<lb>
prompted by the desire that every human heart has felt for<lb>
sympathy and counsel, even from the little creature before<lb>
him ignorant and inexperienced as he was.</p>
<p>But the child, wiser in his innocence than many an older<lb>
counsellor, pointed upward, saying with a look of perfect<lb>
trust, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should look up to the cross upon the tower and think<lb>
<pb n="076">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-077">

<figdesc>Page 076.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of what Bess told me about God, who feeds the birds and<lb>
clothes the flowers, and I should wait patiently, feeling sure<lb>
he would remember me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man leaned his head upon his folded arms and<lb>
nothing stirred in the room, but the wind that stole in through<lb>
the roses to fan the placid face upon the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you weary waiting for me, Jamie dear? I could not<lb>
come before;&rdquo; and as her eager voice broke the silence, Sister<lb>
Bess came hastening in.</p>
<p>The stranger, looking up, saw a young girl regarding him<lb>
from Jamie's close embrace, with a face whose only beauty<lb>
was the light her brother spoke of, that beamed warm and<lb>
bright from her mild countenance and made the poor room<lb>
fairer for its presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Bess, my Bess, sir,&rdquo; cried the boy, &ldquo;and she<lb>
will thank you for your kindness in sitting here so long with<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the person who lodges just below you; I mistook<lb>
this room for my own; pardon me, and let me come again,<lb>
for Jamie has already done me good,&rdquo; replied the stranger<lb>
as he rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bess, dear, will you bring me a cup of water?&rdquo; Jamie<lb>
said; and as she hastened away, he beckoned his friend nearer,<lb>
saying with a timid wistful look,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, if it's wrong, but I wish you would let me<lb>
give you this; it's very little, but it may help some; and I<lb>
think you'll take it to please `poor Jamie.' Won't you, sir?&rdquo;<lb>
and as he spoke, the child offered a bright coin, the proceeds<lb>
of his work.</p>
<p>Tears sprung into the proud man's eyes; he held the little<lb>
wasted hand fast in his own a moment, saying seriously,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> take it, Jamie, as a loan wherewith to begin<lb>
anew the life I was about to fling away as readily as I do<lb>
<pb n="077">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-078">

<figdesc>Page 077.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
this; and with a quick motion he sent a vial whirling down<lb>
into the street. &ldquo;I'll try the world once more in a humbler<lb>
spirit, and have faith in <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> at least, my little Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an altered purpose in his heart, and a brave smile on<lb>
his lips, the young man went away, leaving the child with<lb>
another happy memory, to watch the cross upon the old<lb>
church tower.</p>
<p>It was mid-winter; and in the gloomy house reigned suffering<lb>
and want. Sister Bess worked steadily to earn the dear<lb>
daily bread so many pray for and so many need. Jamie lay<lb>
upon his bed, carving with feeble hands the toys which would<lb>
have found far readier purchasers, could they have told the<lb>
touching story of the frail boy lying meekly in the shadow<lb>
of the solemn change which daily drew more near.</p>
<p>Cheerful and patient always, poverty and pain seemed to<lb>
have no power to darken his bright spirit; for God's blessed<lb>
charity had gifted him with that inward strength and peace<lb>
it so often brings to those who seem to human eyes most<lb>
heavily afflicted.</p>
<p>Secret tears fell sometimes on his pillow, and whispered<lb>
prayers went up; but Bess never knew it, and like a ray of<lb>
sunshine, the boy's tranquil presence lit up that poor home;<lb>
and amid the darkest hours of their adversity, the little rushlight<lb>
of his childish faith never wavered nor went out.</p>
<p>Below them lived the young man, no stranger now, but a<lb>
true friend, whose generous pity would not let them suffer<lb>
any want he could supply. Hunger and cold were hard<lb>
teachers, but he learned their lessons bravely, and though<lb>
his frame grew gaunt and his eye hollow, yet, at heart, he<lb>
felt a better, happier man for the stern discipline that taught<lb>
him the beauty of self-denial and the blessedness of loving<lb>
his neighbor <hi rend="italics">better</hi> than himself.</p>
<pb n="078">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-079">

<figdesc>Page 078.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The child's influence remained unchanged, and when anxiety<lb>
or disappointment burdened him, the young man sat at<lb>
Jamie's bedside listening to the boy's unconscious teaching,<lb>
and receiving fresh hope and courage from the childish words<lb>
and the wan face, always cheerful and serene.</p>
<p>With this example constantly before him, he struggled on,<lb>
feeling that if the world were cold and dark, he had within<lb>
himself one true affection to warm and brighten his hard<lb>
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me joy, Jamie! Give me joy, Bess! the book<lb>
sells well, and we shall yet be rich and famous,&rdquo; cried the<lb>
young author as he burst into the quiet room one wintry<lb>
night with snow-flakes glittering in his hair, and his face<lb>
aglow with the keen air which had no chill in it to him now.</p>
<p>Bess looked up to smile a welcome, and Jamie tried to cry<lb>
&ldquo;Hurrah;&rdquo; but the feeble voice faltered and failed, and he<lb>
could only wave his hand and cling fast to his friend, whispering,<lb>
brokenly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm glad, oh, very glad; for now you need not rob<lb>
yourself for us. I know you have, Walter; I have seen it<lb>
in your poor thin face and these old clothes. It never would<lb>
have been so, but for Bess and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Jamie, and lie here upon my arm and rest; for<lb>
you are very tired with your work, &mdash; I know by this hot<lb>
hand and shortened breath. Are you easy now? Then<lb>
listen; for I've brave news to tell you, and never say again<lb>
I do too much for you, &mdash; the cause of my success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Walter,&rdquo; cried the boy; &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking down upon the wondering face uplifted to his own,<lb>
the young man answered with deep feeling, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months ago I came into this room a desperate and<lb>
despairing man, weary of life, because I knew not how to<lb>
use it, and eager to quit the struggle because I had not<lb>
<pb n="079">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-080">

<figdesc>Page 079.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
learned to conquer fortune by energy and patience. You<lb>
kept me, Jamie, till the reckless mood was passed, and by<lb>
the beauty of your life showed me what mine should be.<lb>
Your courage shamed my cowardice; your faith rebuked my<lb>
fears; your lot made my own seem bright again. I, a man<lb>
with youth, health, and the world before me, was about<lb>
to fling away the life which you, a helpless little child, made<lb>
useful, good, and happy, by the power of your own brave<lb>
will. I felt how weak, how wicked I had been, and was not<lb>
ashamed to learn of you the lesson you so unconsciously<lb>
were teaching. God bless you, Jamie, for the work you did<lb>
that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I do so much?&rdquo; asked the boy with innocent wonder;<lb>
&ldquo;I never knew it, and always thought you had grown<lb>
happier and kinder because I had learned to love you more.<lb>
I'm very glad if I did anything for you, who do so much for<lb>
us. But tell me of the book; you never would before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a kindling eye Walter replied, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not tell you till all was sure; now, listen. I<lb>
wrote a story, Jamie, &mdash; a story of our lives, weaving in few<lb>
fancies of my own and leaving you unchanged, &mdash; the little<lb>
counsellor and good angel of the ambitious man's hard life.<lb>
I painted no fictitious sorrows. What I had seen and keenly<lb>
felt I could truly tell, &mdash; your cheerful patience, Bess's faithful<lb>
love, my struggles, hopes, and fears. This book, unlike<lb>
the others, was not rejected; for the simple truth, told by an<lb>
earnest pen, touched and interested. It was accepted, and<lb>
has been kindly welcomed, thanks to you, Jamie; for many<lb>
buy it to learn more of you, to weep and smile over artless<lb>
words of yours, and forget their pity in their reverence and<lb>
love for the child who taught the man to be, not what he is,<lb>
but what, with God's help, he will yet become.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very kind, and so are you, Walter, and I<lb>
<pb n="080">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-081">

<figdesc>Page 080.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
shall be proud to have you rich and great, though I may<lb>
not be here to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, Jamie, you must; for it will be nothing without<lb>
you;&rdquo; and as he spoke, the young man held the thin<lb>
hand closer in his own and looked more tenderly into the<lb>
face upon his arm.</p>
<p>The boy's eyes shone with a feverish light, a scarlet flush<lb>
burned on his hollow cheek, and the breath came slowly from<lb>
his parted lips, but over his whole countenance there lay a<lb>
beautiful serenity which filled his friend with hope and fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter bid Bess put away that tiresome work; she has<lb>
sat at it all day long, never stirring but to wait on me;&rdquo; and<lb>
as he spoke, a troubled look flitted across the boy's calm face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall soon be done, Jamie, and I must not think of<lb>
rest till then, for there is neither food nor fuel for the morrow.<lb>
Sleep, yourself, dear, and dream of pleasant things; I am<lb>
not very tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bess bent closer to her work, trying to sing a little<lb>
song, that they might not guess how near the tears were to<lb>
her aching eyes.</p>
<p>From beneath his pillow Jamie drew a bit of bread, whispering<lb>
to his friend as he displayed it, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to Bess; I saved it for her till you came, for<lb>
she will not take it from me, and she has eaten nothing all<lb>
this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Jamie?&rdquo; asked Walter, struck by the sharpened<lb>
features of the boy, and the hungry look which for a<lb>
moment glistened in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't need much, you know, for I don't work like<lb>
Bess; but yet she gives me all. Oh, how can I bear to see<lb>
her working so for me, and I lying idle here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Jamie clasped his hands before his face, and<lb>
through his slender fingers streamed such tears as children<lb>
seldom shed.</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="6">
<p>It was so rare a thing for him to weep that it filled Walter<lb>
with dismay and a keener sense of his own powerlessness.<lb>
He could bear any privation for himself alone, but he could<lb>
not see them suffer. He had nothing to offer them; for<lb>
though there was seeming wealth in store for him, he was<lb>
now miserably poor. He stood a moment, looking from<lb>
brother to sister, both so dear to him, and both so plainly<lb>
showing how hard a struggle life had been to them.</p>
<p>With a bitter exclamation, the young man turned away and<lb>
went out into the night, muttering to himself, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theyy shall not suffer; I will beg or steal first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with some vague purpose stirring within him, he went<lb>
swiftly on until he reached a great thoroughfare, nearly deserted<lb>
now, but echoing occasionally to a quick step as some<lb>
one hurried home to his warm fireside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little money, sir, for a sick child and a starving<lb>
woman;&rdquo; and with outstretched hand Walter arrested an old<lb>
man. But he only wrapped his furs still closer and passed<lb>
on, saying sternly, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing for vagrants. Go to work, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman poorly clad in widow's weeds passed at that<lb>
moment, and, as the beggar fell back from the rich man's<lb>
path she dropped a bit of silver in his hand, saying with<lb>
true womanly compassion, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help you! it is all I have to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll beg no more,&rdquo; muttered Walter, as he turned away<lb>
buring with shame and indignation; &ldquo;I'll <hi rend="italics">take</hi> from the<lb>
rich what the poor so freely <hi rend="italics">give.</hi> God pardon me; I see<lb>
no ther way, and they must not starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a vague sense of guilt already upon him, he stole<lb>
into a more unfrequented street and slunk into the shadow<lb>
of doorway to wait for coming steps and nerve himself for<lb>
his first evil deed.</p>

</p>
<p>Glancing up to chide the moonlight for betraying him, he<lb>
started; for there, above the snow-clad roofs, rose the cross<lb>
upon the tower. Hastily he averted his eyes, as if they had<lb>
rested on the mild, reproachful countenance of a friend.</p>
<p>Far up in the wintry sky the bright symbol shone, and<lb>
from it seemed to fall a radiance, warmer than the moonlight,<lb>
clearer than the starlight, showing to that tempted heart the<lb>
darkness of the yet uncommitted wrong.</p>
<p>That familiar sight recalled the past; he thought of Jamie,<lb>
and seemed to hear again the childish words, uttered long<lb>
ago, &ldquo;God will remember us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steps came and went along the lonely street, but the dark<lb>
figure in the shadow never stirred, only stood there with bent<lb>
head, accepting the silent rebuke that shone down upon it, and<lb>
murmuring, softly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God remember little Jamie, and forgive me that my love<lb>
for him led me astray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Walter raised his hand to dash away the drops that<lb>
rose at the memory of the boy, his eye fell on the ring he always<lb>
wore for his dead mother's sake. He had hoped to see<lb>
it one day on Bess's hand, but now a generous thought banished<lb>
all others and with the energy of an honest purpose he<lb>
hastened to sell the ring, purchase a little food and fuel and<lb>
borrowing a warm covering of a kindly neighbor, he went<lb>
back to dispense these comforts with a satisfaction he had little<lb>
thought to feel.</p>
<p>The one lamp burned low; a few dying embers lay upon<lb>
the hearth, and no sound broke the silence but the steady<lb>
rustle of Bess's needle, and the echo of Jamie's hollow cough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrap it round Bess; she has given me her cloak, and<lb>
needs it more than I,&mdash;these coverings do very well;&rdquo; and a he<lb>
spoke, Jamie put away the blanket Walter offered, and uppressing<lb>
a shiver, hid his purple hands beneath the old, thin<lb>
cloak.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is bread, Jamie; eat for Heaven's sake, no need to<lb>
save it now;&rdquo; and Walter pressed it on the boy, but he only<lb>
took a little, saying he had not much need of food and loved<lb>
to see them eat far better.</p>
<p>So in the cheery blaze of the rekindled fire, Bess and<lb>
Walter broke their long fast, and never saw how eagerly<lb>
Jamie gathered up the scattered crumbs, nor heard him murmur<lb>
softly, as he watched them with loving eyes,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no cold nor hunger up in heaven, but<lb>
enough for all, &mdash; enough for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter, you'll be kind to Bess when I am not here?&rdquo;<lb>
he whispered earnestly, as his friend came to draw his bed<lb>
within the ruddy circle of the firelight gleaming on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Jamie, kinder than a brother,&rdquo; was the quick reply.<lb>
&ldquo;But why ask me that with such a wistful face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did not answer, but turned on his pillow and<lb>
kissed his sister's shadow as it flitted by.</p>
<p>Gray dawn was in the sky before they spoke again. Bess<lb>
slept the deep, dreamless sleep of utter weariness, her head<lb>
pillowed on her arms. Walter sat beside the bed, lost in<lb>
sweet and bitter musings, silent and motionless, fancying the<lb>
boy slept. But a low voice broke the silence, whispering<lb>
feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter, will you take me in your strong arms and lay<lb>
me on my little couch beside the window? I should love to<lb>
see the cross again, and it is nearly day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So light, so very light, the burden seemed, Walter turned his<lb>
face aside lest the boy should see the sorrowful emotion painted<lb>
there, and with a close embrace he laid him tenderly down<lb>
to watch the first ray climbing up the old gray tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The frost lies so thickly on the window-panes that you<lb>
cannot see it, even when the light comes, Jamie,&rdquo; said his<lb>
friend, vainly trying to gratify the boy's wish.</p>
<pb n="084">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-085">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun will melt it soon, and I can wait, &mdash; I can wait,<lb>
Walter; it's but a little while;&rdquo; and Jamie, with a patient<lb>
smile, turned his face to the dim window and lay silent.</p>
<p>Higher and higher crept the sunshine till it shone through<lb>
the frostwork on the boy's bright head; his bird awoke and<lb>
carolled blithely, but he never stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep at last, poor, tired little Jamie; I'll not wake him<lb>
till the day is warmer;&rdquo; and Walter, folding the coverings<lb>
closer over the quiet figure, sat beside it, waiting till it should<lb>
wake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jamie dear, look up, and see how beautifully your last<lb>
rose has blossomed in the night when least we looked for it;&rdquo;<lb>
and Bess came smiling in with the one white rose, so fragrant<lb>
but so frail.</p>
<p>Jamie did not turn to greet her, for all frost had melted<lb>
from the boy's life now; another flower had blossomed<lb>
in the early dawn, and though the patient face upon the<lb>
pillow was bathed in sunshine, little Jamie was not there to<lb>
see it gleaming on the cross. God had remembered him.</p>
<p>Spring showers had made the small mound green, and<lb>
scattered flowers in the churchyard. Sister Bess sat in the<lb>
silent room alone, working still, but pausing often to wipe<lb>
away the tears that fell upon a letter on her knee.</p>
<p>Steps came springing up the narrow stairs and Walter<lb>
entered with a beaming face, to show the first rich earnings<lb>
of his pen, and ask her to rest from her long labor in the<lb>
shelter of his love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Bess, what troubles you? Let me share your<lb>
sorrow and try to lighten it,&rdquo; he cried with anxious tenderness,<lb>
sitting beside her on the little couch where Jamie fell<lb>
asleep.</p>
<p>In the frank face smiling on her, the girl's innocent eyes<lb>
<pb n="085">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-086">

<figdesc>Page 085.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
read nothing but the friendly interest of a brother, and remembering<lb>
his care and kindness, she forgot her womanly timidity<lb>
in her great longing for sympathy, and freely told him all.</p>
<p>Told him of the lover she left years ago to cling to Jamie,<lb>
and how this lover went across the sea hoping to increase his<lb>
little fortune that the helpless brother might be sheltered for<lb>
love of her. How misfortune followed him, and when she<lb>
looked to welcome back a prosperous man, there came a letter<lb>
saying that all was lost and he must begin the world anew and<lb>
win a home to offer her before he claimed the heart so faithful<lb>
to him all these years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writes so tenderly and bears his disappointment<lb>
bravely for my sake; but it is very hard to see our happiness<lb>
deferred again when such a little sum would give us to each<lb>
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she ceased, Bess looked for comfort into the countenance<lb>
of her companion, never seeing through her tears how<lb>
pale it was with sudden grief, how stern with repressed emotion.<lb>
She only saw the friend whom Jamie loved and that<lb>
tie drew her toward him as to an elder brother to whom she<lb>
turned for help, unconscious then how great his own need<lb>
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew of this before, Bess; you kept your secret<lb>
well.&rdquo; he said, trying to seem unchanged.</p>
<p>The color deepened in her cheek; but she answered simply,<lb>
&ldquo;I never spoke of it, for words could do no good, and Jamie<lb>
grieved silently about it, for he thought it a great sacrifice,<lb>
though I looked on it as a sacred duty, and he often wearied<lb>
himself to show in many loving ways how freshly he remembered<lb>
it. My grateful little Jamie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And her eyes wandered to the green tree-tops tossing in<lb>
the wind, whose shadows flickered pleasantly above the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think a little, Bess, before I counsel you. Keep<lb>
<pb n="086">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-087">

<figdesc>Page 086.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
a good heart and rest assured that I will help you if I<lb>
can,&rdquo; said Walter, trying to speak hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you come to tell me something; at least, I fancied I<lb>
saw some good tidings in your face just now. Forgive my<lb>
selfish grief, and see how gladly I will sympathize with any<lb>
joy of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, Bess, another time will do as well,&rdquo; he<lb>
answered, eager to be gone lest he should betray what must<lb>
be kept most closely now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never will be told, Bess, &mdash; never in this world,&rdquo; he<lb>
sighed bitterly as he went back to his own room which never<lb>
in his darkest hours had seemed so dreary; for now the bright<lb>
hope of his life was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it in my power to make them happy,&rdquo; he mused<lb>
as he sat alone, &ldquo;but I cannot do it, for in this separation<lb>
lies my only hope. He may die or may grow weary, and<lb>
then to whom will Bess turn for comfort but to me? I will<lb>
work on, earn riches and a name, and if that hour should<lb>
come, then in her desolation I will offer all to Bess and surely<lb>
she will listen and accept. Yet it were a generous thing<lb>
to make her happiness at once, forgetful of my own. How<lb>
shall I bear to see her waiting patiently, while youth and<lb>
hope are fading slowly, and know that I might end her weary<lb>
trial and join two faithful hearts? Oh, Jamie, I wish to<lb>
Heaven I were asleep with you, freed from the temptations<lb>
that beset me. It is so easy to perceive the right, so hard<lb>
to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of that familiar name, uttered despairingly,<lb>
aloud, fell with a sweet and solemn music upon Walter's car.<lb>
A flood of tender memories swept away the present, and<lb>
brought back the past. He thought of that short life, so full<lb>
of pain and yet of patience, of the sunny nature which no<lb>
<pb n="087">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-088">

<figdesc>Page 087.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
cloud could overshadow, and the simple trust which was its<lb>
strength and guide.</p>
<p>He thought of that last night and saw now with clearer<lb>
eyes the sacrifices and the trials silently borne for love of<lb>
Bess.</p>
<p>The beautiful example of the child rebuked the passion of<lb>
the man, and through the magic of affection strengthened<lb>
generous impulses and banished selfish hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to be kind to Bess, and with God's help I<lb>
will keep my vow. Teach me to bear my pain, to look for<lb>
help where you found it, little Jamie;&rdquo; and as he spoke, the<lb>
young man gazed up at the shining cross, striving to see in<lb>
it not merely an object of the dead boy's love, but a symbol<lb>
of consolation, hope, and faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a noble thing to see an honest man cleave his own<lb>
heart in twain to fling away the baser part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words came to Walter's mind and fixed the resolution<lb>
wavering there, and as his glance wandered from the<lb>
gray tower to the churchyard full of summer stillness, he<lb>
said within himself,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the hardest struggle of my life, but I will conquer<lb>
and come out from the conflict master of myself at least, and<lb>
like Jamie, try to wait until the sunshine comes again, even<lb>
if it only shine upon me, dead like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no light task to leave the airy castles built by love<lb>
and hope, and go back cheerfully to the solitude of a life<lb>
whose only happiness for a time was in the memory of the<lb>
past. But through the weeks that bore one lover home, the<lb>
other struggled to subdue his passion, and be as generous in<lb>
his sorrow as he would have been in his joy.</p>
<p>It was no easy conquest; but he won the hardest of all<lb>
victories, that of self, and found in the place of banished<lb>
pride and bitterness a patient strength, and the one desire<lb>
<pb n="088">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-089">

<figdesc>Page 088.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to be indeed more generous than a brother to gentle Bess.<lb>
He had truly &ldquo;cleft his heart in twain and flung away the<lb>
baser part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days before the absent lover came, Walter went to<lb>
Bess, and. with a countenance whose pale serenity touched her<lb>
deeply, he laid his gift before her, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe this all to Jamie; and the best use I can make of<lb>
it is to secure your happiness, as I promised him I'd try to<lb>
do. Take it and God bless you. Sister Bess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Walter, what will your future be if I take<lb>
this and go away to enjoy it as you would have me?&rdquo; Bess<lb>
asked, with an earnestness that awoke his wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall work, Bess, and in that find content and consolation<lb>
for the loss of you and Jamie. Do not think of me;<lb>
this money will do me far more good in your hands than my<lb>
own. Believe me it is best to be so, therefore do not hesitate.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>Bess took it, for she had learned the cause of Walter's<lb>
restless wanderings and strange avoidance of herself of late,<lb>
and she judged wisely that the generous nature should be<lb>
gratified, and the hard-won victory rewarded by the full accomplishment<lb>
of its unselfish end. Few words expressed<lb>
her joyful thanks, but from that time Walter felt that he<lb>
held as dear a place as Jamie in her grateful heart, and was<lb>
content.</p>
<p>Summer flowers were blooming when Bess went from the<lb>
old home a happy wife, leaving her faithful friend alone in<lb>
the little room where Jamie lived and died.</p>
<p>Years passed, and Walter's pen had won for him an honored<lb>
name. Poverty and care were no longer his companions;<lb>
many homes were open to him, many hearts would<lb>
gladly welcome him, but he still lingered in the gloomy house,<lb>

a serious, solitary man, for his heart lay beneath the daisies<lb>
of a child's grave.</p>
<p>But his life was rich in noble aims and charitable deeds,<lb>
and with his strong nature softened by the sharp discipline<lb>
of sorrow, and sweetened by the presence of a generous love,<lb>
he was content to dwell alone with the memory of little Jamie,<lb>
in the shadow of &ldquo;the cross upon the tower.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>HARDLY was I settled again, when the inevitable bowl appeared,<lb>
and its bearer delivered a message I had expected, yet dreaded<lb>
to receive:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John is going, ma'am, and wants to see you, if you can come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment this boy is asleep; tell him so, and let me know if I am<lb>
in danger of being too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Ganymede departed, and while I quieted poor Shaw, I thought of<lb>
John. He came in a day or two after the others; and, one evening,<lb>
when I entered my &ldquo;pathetic room,&rdquo; I found a lately emptied bed occupied<lb>
by a large, fair man, with a fine face, and the serenest eyes I ever<lb>
met. One of the earlier comers had often spoken of a friend, who had<lb>
remained behind, that those apparently worse wounded than himself<lb>
might reach a shelter first. It seemed a David and Jonathan sort of<lb>
friendship. The man fretted for his mate, and was never tired of praising<lb>
John, &mdash; his courage, sobriety, self-denial, and unfailing kindliness of<lb>
heart; always winding up with, &ldquo;He's an out an' out fine feller, ma'am;<lb>
you see if he ain't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence, and when he<lb>
came, watched him for a night or two, before I made friends with him;<lb>
for, to tell the truth, I was a little afraid of the stately looking man,<lb>
whose bed had to be lengthened to accommodate his commanding stature;<lb>
who seldom spoke, uttered no complaint, asked no sympathy, but tranquilly<lb>
observed what went on about him; and, as he lay high upon his<lb>
pillows, no picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever fuller of real<lb>
dignity than this Virginia blacksmith. A most attractive face he had,<lb>
framed in brown hair and beard, comely featured and full of vigor, as<lb>
yet unsubdued by pain; thoughtful and often beautifully mild while<lb>
watching the afflictions of others, as if entirely forgetful of his own. His<lb>
mouth was grave and firm, with plenty of will and courage in its lines,<lb>
but a smile could make it as sweet as any woman's; and his eyes were<lb>
child's eyes, looking one fairly in the face with a clear, straightforward<lb>
glance, which promised well for such as placed their faith in him. He<lb>
seemed to cling to life, as if it were rich in duties and delights, and he<lb>
had learned the secret of content. The only time I saw his composure<lb>
disturbed was when my surgeon brought another to examine John, who<lb>
<pb n="091">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-092">

<figdesc>Page 091.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
scrutinized their faces with an anxious look, asking of the elder, &mdash; &ldquo;Do<lb>
you think I shall pull through, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope so, my man.&rdquo; And, as<lb>
the two passed on, John's eye still followed them, with an intentness<lb>
which would have won a clearer answer from them, had they seen it. A<lb>
momentary shadow flitted over his face; then came the usual serenity,<lb>
as if, in that brief eclipse, he had acknowledged the existence of some<lb>
hard possibility, and, asking nothing, yet hoping all things, left the issue<lb>
in God's hands, with that submission which is true piety.</p>
<p>The next night, as I went my rounds with Dr. P., I happened to ask<lb>
which man in the room probably suffered most; and, to my great surprise,<lb>
he glanced at John: &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every breath he draws is like a stab; for the ball pierced the left<lb>
lung, broke a rib, and did no end of damage here and there; so the poor<lb>
lad can find neither forgetfulness nor ease, because he must lie on his<lb>
wounded back or suffocate. It will be a hard struggle and a long one,<lb>
for he possesses great vitality; but even his temperate life can't save<lb>
him; I wish it could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't mean he must die, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, there's not the slightest hope for him; and you'd better<lb>
tell him so before loug; women have a way of doing such things comfortably,<lb>
so I leave it to you. He won't last more than a day or two, at<lb>
furthest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily, if I had not learned<lb>
the wisdom of bottling up one's tears for leisure moments. Such an end<lb>
seemed very hard for such a man, when half a dozen worn-out, worthless<lb>
bodies round him were gathering up the remnants of wasted lives, to linger<lb>
on for years perhaps, burdens to others, daily reproaches to themselves.<lb>
The army needed men like John, &mdash; earnest, brave, and faithful; fighting<lb>
for liberty and justice with both heart and hand, true soldiers of the<lb>
Lord. I could not give him up so soon, or think with any patience of<lb>
so excellent a nature robbed of its fulfilment, and blundered into eternity<lb>
by the rashness or stupidity of those at whose hands so many lives<lb>
may be required. It was an easy thing for Dr. P. to say, &ldquo;Tell him<lb>
he must die,&rdquo; but a cruelly hard thing to do, and by no means as &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;<lb>
as he politely suggested. I had not the heart to do it then,<lb>
and privately indulged the hope that some change for the better might<lb>
take place, in spite of gloomy prophecies, so, rendering my task unnecessary.<lb>
A few minutes later, as I came in again with fresh rollers,<lb>
I saw John sitting erect, with no one to support him, while the surgeon<lb>
dressed his back. I had never hitherto seen it done; for, having simpler<lb>
wounds to attend to, and knowing the fidelity of the attendant, I had<lb>
left John to him, thinking it might be more agreeable and safe; for both<lb>
strength and experience were needed in his case. I had forgotten that<lb>
<pb n="092">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-093">

<figdesc>Page 092.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the strong man might long for the gentler tendance of a woman's hands,<lb>
the sympathetic magnetism of a woman's presence, as well as the feebler<lb>
souls about him. The Doctor's words caused me to reproach myself<lb>
with neglect, not of any real duty perhaps, but of those little cares and<lb>
kindnesses that solace homesick spirits, and make the heavy hours pass<lb>
easier. John looked lonely and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent<lb>
head, hands folded on his knee, and no outward sign of suffering, till,<lb>
looking nearer, I saw great tears roll down and drop upon the floor. It<lb>
was a new sight there; for though I had seen many suffer, some swore,<lb>
some groaned, most endured silently, but none wept. Yet it did not<lb>
seem weak, only very touching, and straightway my fear vanished, my<lb>
heart opened wide and took him in, as, gathering the bent head in my<lb>
arms, as freely as if he had been a little child, I said, &mdash; &ldquo;Let me help<lb>
you bear it, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never, on any human countenance, have I seen so swift and beautiful<lb>
a look of gratitude, surprise, and comfort, as that which answered me<lb>
more eloquently than the whispered, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you ma'am; this is right good! this is what I wanted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not ask for it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't like to be a trouble; you seemed so busy, and I could manage<lb>
to get on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not want it any more, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did he; for now I understood the wistful look that sometimes followed<lb>
me, as I went out, after a brief pause beside his bed, or merely<lb>
a passing nod, while busied with those who seemed to need me more<lb>
than he, because more urgent in their demands; now I knew that to<lb>
him, as to so many, I was the poor substitute for mother, wife, or sister, and<lb>
in his eyes no stranger, but a friend who hitherto had seemed neglectful;<lb>
for, in his modesty, he had never guessed the truth. This was changed<lb>
now; and, through the tedious operation of probing, bathing, and dressing<lb>
his wounds, he leaned against me, holding my hand fast, and, if<lb>
pain wrung further tears from him, no one saw them fall but me. When<lb>
he was laid down again, I hovered about him, in a remorseful state of<lb>
mind that would not let me rest, till I had bathed his face, brushed his<lb>
&ldquo;bonny brown hair,&rdquo; set all things smooth about him, and laid a knot<lb>
of heath and heliotrope on his clean pillow. While doing this, he<lb>
watched me with the satisfied expression I so liked to see; and when I<lb>
offered the little nosegay, held it carefully in his great hand, smoothed<lb>
a ruffled leaf or two, surveyed and smelt it with an air of genuine delight,<lb>
and lay contentedly regarding the glimmer of the sunshine on the<lb>
green. Although the manliest man among my forty, he said, &ldquo;Yes,<lb>
ma'am,&rdquo; like a little boy; received suggestions for his comfort with the<lb>
quick smile that brightened his whole face; and now and then, as I<lb>
<pb n="093">
<eaffig volid="eaf444T" entity="f444-094">

<figdesc>Page 093.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stood tidying the table by his bed, I felt him softly touch my gown, as<lb>
if to assure himself that I was there. Anything more natural and frank<lb>
I never saw, and found this brave John as bashful as brave, yet full of<lb>
excellences and fine aspirations, which, having no power to express<lb>
themselves in words, seemed to have bloomed into his character and<lb>
made him what he was.</p>
<p>After that night, an hour of each evening that remained to him was<lb>
devoted to his ease or pleasure. He could not talk much, for breath was<lb>
precious, and he spoke in whispers; but from occasional conversations,<lb>
I gleaned scraps of private history which only added to the affection and<lb>
respect I felt for him. Once he asked me to write a letter, and, as I settled<lb>
pen and paper, I said, with an irrepressible glimmer of feminine<lb>
curiosity, &ldquo;Shall it be addressed to wife, or mother, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, ma'am; I've got no wife, and will write to mother myself<lb>
when I get better. Did you think I was married because of this?&rdquo; he<lb>
asked, touching a plain ring he wore, and often turned thoughtfully on<lb>
his finger when he lay alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly that, but more from a settled sort of look you have, &mdash; a look<lb>
which young men seldom get until they marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know that; but I'm not so very young, ma'am; thirty in May<lb>
and have been what you might call settled this ten years; for mother's<lb>
a widow; I'm the oldest child she has, and it wouldn't do for me to marry<lb>
until Lizzie has a home of her own, and Laurie's learned his trade;<lb>
for we're not rich, and I must be father to the children, and husband to<lb>
the dear old woman, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt but you are both, John; yet how came you to go to war,<lb>
if you felt so? Wasn't enlisting as bad as marrying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am, not as I see it, for one is helping my neighbor, the other<lb>
pleasing myself. I went because I couldn't help it. I didn't want the<lb>
glory or the pay; I wanted the right thing done, and people kept saying<lb>
the men who were in earnest cught to fight. I was in earnest, the Lord<lb>
knows! but I held off as long as I could, not knowing which was my<lb>
duty; mother saw the case, gave me her ring to keep me steady, and<lb>
said `Go;' so I went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short story and a simple one, but the man and the mother were portrayed<lb>
better than pages of fine writing could have done it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever regret that you came, when you lie here suffering so<lb>
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, ma'am; I haven't helped a great deal, but I've shown I was<lb>
willing to give my life, and perhaps I've got to; but I don't blame anybody,<lb>
and if it was to do over again, I'd do it. I'm a little sorry I wasn't<lb>
wounded in front; it looks cowardly to be hit in the back, but I obeyed<lb>
orders, and it don't matter in the end, I know.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>Poor John! it did not matter now, except that a shot in front might<lb>
have spared the long agony in store for him. He seemed to read the<lb>
thought that troubled me, as he spoke so hopefully when there was no<lb>
hope, for he suddenly added, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my first battle; do they think it's going to be my last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid they do, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the hardest question I had ever been called upon to answer;<lb>
doubly hard with those clear eyes fixed on mine, forcing a truthful answer<lb>
by their own truth. He seemed a little startled at first, pondered<lb>
over the fateful fact a moment, then shook his head, with a glance at the<lb>
broad chest and muscular limbs stretched out before him: &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not afraid, but it's difficult to believe all at once. I'm so strong<lb>
it don't seem possible for such a little wound to kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merry Mercutio's dying words glanced through my memory as he<lb>
spoke: &mdash; &ldquo;'Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but'<lb>
tis enough.&rdquo; And John would have said the same, could he have seen<lb>
the ominous black holes between his shoulders, he never had; and, seeing<lb>
the ghastly sights about him, could not believe his own wound more<lb>
fatal than these, for all the suffering it caused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I write to your mother, now?&rdquo; I asked, thinking that these<lb>
sudden tidings might change all plans and purposes; but they did not;<lb>
for the man received the order of the Divine Commander to march, with<lb>
the same unquestioning obedience with which the soldier had received<lb>
that of the human one, doubtless remembering that the first led him<lb>
to life, and the last to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am; to Laurie just the same; he'll break it to her best, and<lb>
I'll add a line to her myself when you get done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I wrote the letter which he dictated, finding it better than any I<lb>
had sent; for, though here and there a little ungrammatical or inelegant,<lb>
each sentence came to me briefly worded, but most expressive; full of<lb>
excellent counsel to the boy, tenderly bequeathing &ldquo;mother and Lizzie&rdquo;<lb>
to his care, and bidding him good-by in words the sadder for their<lb>
simplicity. He added a few lines with steady hand, and, as I sealed it,<lb>
said, with a patient sort of sigh, &ldquo;I hope the answer will come in time<lb>
for me to see it;&rdquo; then, turning away his face, laid the flowers against<lb>
his lips, as if to hide some quiver of emotion at the thought of such a<lb>
sudden sundering of all the dear home-ties.</p>
<p>These things had happened two days before; now John was dying,<lb>
and the letter had not come. I had been summoned to many death-beds<lb>
in my life, but to none that made my heart ache as it did then, since my<lb>
mother called me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its<lb>
gentleness and patient strength. As I went in, John stretched out both<lb>
hands, &mdash;</p>
<pb n="095">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you'd come! I guess I'm moving on, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was; and so rapidly that, even while he spoke, over his face I saw<lb>
the gray veil falling that no human hand can lift. I sat down by him,<lb>
wiped the drops from his forehead, stirred the air about him with the<lb>
slow wave of a fan, and waited to help him die. He stood in sore need<lb>
of help, &mdash; and I could do so little; for, as the doctor had foretold, the<lb>
strong body rebelled against death, and fought every inch of the way,<lb>
forcing him to draw each breath with a spasm, and clench his hands<lb>
with an imploring look, as if he asked, &ldquo;How long must I endure this,<lb>
and be still?&rdquo; For hours he suffered dumbly, without a moment's respite,<lb>
or a moment's murmuring; his limbs grew cold, his face damp, his<lb>
lips white, and, again and again, he tore the covering off his breast, as<lb>
if the lightest weight added to his agony; yet through it all, his eyes<lb>
never lost their perfect serenity, and the man's soul seemed to sit therein,<lb>
undaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh.</p>
<p>One by one the men woke, and round the room appeared a circle of<lb>
pale faces and watchful eyes, full of awe and pity; for, though a stranger,<lb>
John was beloved by all. Each man there had wondered at his<lb>
patience, respected his piety, admired his fortitude, and now lamented<lb>
his hard death; for the influence of an upright nature had made itself<lb>
deeply felt, even in one little week. Presently, the Jonathan who so<lb>
loved this comely David came creeping from his bed for a last look and<lb>
word. The kind soul was full of trouble, as the choke in his voice, the<lb>
grasp of his hand betrayed; but there were no tears, and the farewell of<lb>
the friends was the more touching for its brevity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old boy, how are you?&rdquo; faltered the one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most through, thank heaven!&rdquo; whispered the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I say or do anything for you anywheres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my things home, and tell them that I did my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will! I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, John, good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed each other, tenderly as women, and so parted; for poor<lb>
Ned could not stay to see his comrade die. For a little while, there was<lb>
no sound in the room but the drip of water from a stump or two, and<lb>
John's distressful gasps, as he slowly breathed his life away. I thought<lb>
him nearly gone, and had just laid down the fan, believing its help to be<lb>
no longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his bed, and cried out<lb>
with a bitter cry that broke the silence, sharply startling every one with<lb>
its agonized appeal, &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God's sake, give me air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the only cry pain or death had wrung from him, the only boon<lb>
he had asked; and none of us could grant it, for all the airs that blew<lb>

were useless now. Dan flung up the window. The first red streak of<lb>
dawn was warming the gray east, a herald of the coming sun. John saw<lb>
it, and with the love of light which lingers in us to the end, seemed to<lb>
read in it a sign of hope of help, for, over his whole face there broke that<lb>
mysterious expression, brighter than any smile, which often comes to<lb>
eyes that look their last. He laid himself gently down; and, stretching<lb>
out his strong right arm, as if to grasp and bring the blessed air to his<lb>
lips in a fuller flow, lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness, which assured<lb>
us that for him suffering was forever past. He died then; for,<lb>
though the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little longer, they<lb>
were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt against the wreck,<lb>
which an immortal voyager had deserted with a smile. He never spoke<lb>
again, but to the end held my hand close, so close that when he was<lb>
asleep at last, I could not draw it away. Dan helped me, warning me<lb>
as he did so, that it was unsafe for dead and living flesh to lie so long<lb>
together; but though my hand was strangely cold and stiff, and four<lb>
white marks remained across its back, even when warmth and color had<lb>
returned elsewhere, I could not but be glad that, through its touch, the<lb>
presence of human sympathy, perhaps, had lightened that hard hour.</p>
<p>When they had made him ready for the grave, John lay in state for<lb>
half an hour, a thing which seldom happened in that busy place; but a<lb>
universal sentiment of reverence and affection seemed to fill the hearts<lb>
of all who had known or heard of him; and when the rumor of his death<lb>
went through the house, always astir, many came to see him, and I felt<lb>
a tender sort of pride in my lost patient; for he looked a most heroic<lb>
figure, lying there stately and still as the statue of some young knight<lb>
asleep upon his tomb. The lovely expression which so often beautifies<lb>
dead faces soon replaced the marks of pain, and I longed for those who<lb>
loved him best to see him when half an hour's acquaintance with Death<lb>
had made them friends. As we stood looking at him, the ward master<lb>
handed me a letter, saying it had been forgotten the night before. It<lb>
was John's letter, come just an hour too late to gladden the eyes that<lb>
had longed and looked for it so eagerly; yet he had it; for, after I had<lb>
cut some brown locks for his mother, and taken off the ring to send her,<lb>
telling how well the talisman had done its work, I kissed this good son<lb>
for her sake, and laid the letter in his hand, still folded as when I drew<lb>
my own away, feeling that its place was there, and making myself happy<lb>
with the thought, even in his solitary place in the &ldquo;Government<lb>
Lot,&rdquo; he would not be without some token of the love which makes life<lb>
beautiful and outlives death. Then I left him, glad to have known so<lb>
genuine a man, and carrying with me an enduring memory of the brave<lb>
Virginia blacksmith, as he lay serenely waiting for the dawn of that<lb>
long day which knows no night.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;AUNT BETSEY, there 's going to be a new Declaration<lb>
of Independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless and save us, what do you mean, child?&rdquo; And<lb>
the startled old lady precipitated a pie into the oven<lb>
with destructive haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that, being of age, I 'm going to take care<lb>
<pb n="002">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-013">

<figdesc>Page 002.</figdesc>

of myself, and not be a burden any longer. Uncle<lb>
wishes me out of the way; thinks I ought to go, and,<lb>
sooner or later, will tell me so. I don't intend to wait<lb>
for that, but, like the people in fairy tales, travel away<lb>
into the world and seek my fortune. I know I can<lb>
find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie emphasized her speech by energetic demonstrations<lb>
in the bread-trough, kneading the dough as if<lb>
it was her destiny, and she was shaping it to suit herself;<lb>
while Aunt Betsey stood listening, with uplifted<lb>
pie-fork, and as much astonishment as her placid face<lb>
was capable of expressing. As the girl paused, with a<lb>
decided thump, the old lady exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What crazy idee you got into your head now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very sane and sensible one that's got to be<lb>
worked out, so please listen to it, ma'am. I've had it a<lb>
good while, I've thought it over thoroughly, and I 'm<lb>
sure it 's the right thing for me to do. I 'm old enough<lb>
to take care of myself; and if I 'd been a boy, I should<lb>
have been told to do it long ago. I hate to be dependent;<lb>
and now there 's no need of it, I can't bear it any<lb>
longer. If you were poor, I wouldn't leave you; for I<lb>
never forget how kind <hi rend="italics">you</hi> have been to me. But<lb>
Uncle doesn't love or understand me; I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> a burden to<lb>
him, and I must go where I can take care of myself. I<lb>
can't be happy till I do, for there 's nothing here for me.<lb>
I 'm sick of this dull town, where the one idea is eat,<lb>
drink, and get rich; I don't find any friends to help me<lb>
as I want to be helped, or any work that I can do well;<lb>
so let me go, Aunty, and find my place, wherever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do need you, deary; and you mustn't think<lb>
Uncle don't like you. He does, only he don't show it;<lb>
<pb n="003">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-014">

<figdesc>Page 003.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and when your odd ways fret him, he ain't pleasant, I<lb>
know. I don't see why you can't be contented; I 've<lb>
lived here all my days, and never found the place lonesome,<lb>
or the folks unneighborly.&rdquo; And Aunt Betsey<lb>
looked perplexed by the new idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I are very different, ma'am. There was<lb>
more yeast put into my composition, I guess; and, after<lb>
standing quiet in a warm corner so long, I begin to ferment,<lb>
and ought to be kneaded up in time, so that I<lb>
may turn out a wholesome loaf. You can't do this; so<lb>
let me go where it can be done, else I shall turn sour<lb>
and good for nothing. Does that make the matter any<lb>
clearer?&rdquo; And Christie's serious face relaxed into a<lb>
smile as her aunt's eye went from her to the nicely<lb>
moulded loaf offered as an illustration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean, Kitty; but I never thought<lb>
on 't before. You be better riz than me; though, let<lb>
me tell you, too much emptins makes bread poor stuff,<lb>
like baker's trash; and too much workin' up makes it<lb>
hard and dry. Now fly 'round, for the big oven is<lb>
most het, and this cake takes a sight of time in the<lb>
mixin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven't said I might go, Aunty,&rdquo; began the girl,<lb>
after a long pause devoted by the old lady to the preparation<lb>
of some compound which seemed to require<lb>
great nicety of measurement in its ingredients; for<lb>
when she replied, Aunt Betsey curiously interlarded<lb>
her speech with audible directions to herself from the<lb>
receipt-book before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain't no right to keep you, dear, ef you choose to<lb>
take (a pinch of salt). I 'm sorry you ain't happy, and<lb>
think you might be ef you 'd only (beat six eggs, yolks and<lb>

</eaffig>
whites together). But ef you can't, and feel that you<lb>
need (two cups of sugar), only speak to Uncle, and ef<lb>
he says (a squeeze of fresh lemon), go, my dear, and<lb>
take my blessin' with you (not forgettin' to cover with<lb>
a piece of paper).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie's laugh echoed through the kitchen; and the<lb>
old lady smiled benignly, quite unconscious of the<lb>
cause of the girl's merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall ask Uncle to-night, and I know he won't<lb>
object. Then I shall write to see if Mrs. Flint has a<lb>
room for me, where I can stay till I get something to<lb>
<pb n="005">

</eaffig>
do. There is plenty of work in the world, and I 'm not<lb>
afraid of it; so you 'll soon hear good news of me.<lb>
Don't look sad, for you know I never could forget <hi rend="italics">you,</hi><lb>
even if I should become the greatest lady in the land.&rdquo;<lb>
And Christie left the prints of two floury but affectionate<lb>
hands on the old lady's shoulders, as she kissed the<lb>
wrinkled face that had never worn a frown to her.</p>
<p>Full of hopeful fancies, Christie salted the pans and<lb>
buttered the dough in pleasant forgetfulness of all mundane<lb>
affairs, and the ludicrous dismay of Aunt Betsey,<lb>
who followed her about rectifying her mistakes, and<lb>
watching over her as if this sudden absence of mind<lb>
had roused suspicions of her sanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle, I want to go away, and get my own living,<lb>
if you please,&rdquo; was Christie's abrupt beginning, as they<lb>
sat round the evening fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! what 's that?&rdquo; said Uncle Enos, rousing from<lb>
the doze he was enjoying, with a candle in perilous<lb>
proximity to his newspaper and his nose.</p>
<p>Christie repeated her request, and was much relieved,<lb>
when, after a meditative stare, the old man briefly<lb>
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you might think it rash or silly, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it 's the best thing you could do; and I like<lb>
your good sense in pupposin' on't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may really go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon 's ever you like. Don't pester me about it till<lb>
you 're ready; then I 'll give you a little suthing to start<lb>
off with.&rdquo; And Uncle Enos returned to &ldquo;The Farmer's<lb>
Friend,&rdquo; as if cattle were more interesting than kindred.</p>
<p>Christie was accustomed to his curt speech and<lb>
<pb n="006">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-017">

<figdesc>Page 006.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
careless manner; had expected nothing more cordial; and,<lb>
turning to her aunt, said, rather bitterly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn't I tell you he 'd be glad to have me go? No<lb>
matter! When I 've done something to be proud of, he<lb>
will be as glad to see me back again.&rdquo; Then her voice<lb>
changed, her eyes kindled, and the firm lips softened<lb>
with a smile. &ldquo;Yes, I 'll try my experiment; then I 'll<lb>
get rich; found a home for girls like myself; or, better<lb>
still, be a Mrs. Fry, a Florence Nightingale, or&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you on 't for stockin's, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie's castles in the air vanished at the prosaic<lb>
question; but, after a blank look, she answered pleasantly:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for bringing me down to my feet again,<lb>
when I was soaring away too far and too fast. I 'm<lb>
poorly off, ma'am; but if you are knitting these for me,<lb>
I shall certainly start on a firm foundation.&rdquo; And, leaning<lb>
on Aunt Betsey's knee, she patiently discussed the<lb>
wardrobe question from hose to head-gear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't you think you could be contented any way,<lb>
Christie, ef I make the work lighter, and leave you<lb>
more time for your books and things?&rdquo; asked the old<lb>
lady, loth to lose the one youthful element in her quiet<lb>
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am, for I can't find what I want here,&rdquo; was<lb>
the decided answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <hi rend="italics">do</hi> you want, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in the fire, and I 'll try to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady obediently turned her spectacles that<lb>
way; and Christie said in a tone half serious, half playful:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see those two logs? Well that one<lb>
<pb n="007">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-018">

<figdesc>Page 007.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
smouldering dismally away in the corner is what my life is<lb>
now; the other blazing and singing is what I want my<lb>
life to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, what an idee! They are both a-burnin'<lb>
where they are put, and both will be ashes to-morrow;<lb>
so what difference <hi rend="italics">doos</hi> it make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie smiled at the literal old lady; but, following<lb>
the fancy that pleased her, she added earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the end is the same; but it <hi rend="italics">does</hi> make a<lb>
difference <hi rend="italics">how</hi> they turn to ashes, and <hi rend="italics">how</hi> I spend my<lb>
life. That log, with its one dull spot of fire, gives<lb>
neither light nor warmth, but lies sizzling despondently<lb>
among the cinders. But the other glows from end to<lb>
end with cheerful little flames that go singing up the<lb>
chimney with a pleasant sound. Its light fills the room<lb>
and shines out into the dark; its warmth draws us<lb>
nearer, making the hearth the cosiest place in the house,<lb>
and we shall all miss the friendly blaze when it dies.<lb>
Yes,&rdquo; she added, as if to herself, &ldquo;I hope my life may<lb>
be like that, so that, whether it be long or short, it will<lb>
be useful and cheerful while it lasts, will be missed when<lb>
it ends, and leave something behind besides ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though she only half understood them, the girl's<lb>
words touched the kind old lady, and made her look<lb>
anxiously at the eager young face gazing so wistfully<lb>
into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good smart blowin' up with the belluses would<lb>
make the green stick burn most as well as the dry one<lb>
after a spell. I guess contentedness is the best bellus<lb>
for young folks, ef they would only think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right, Aunty; but I want to try<lb>
for myself; and if I fail, I 'll come back and follow your<lb>
<pb n="008">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-019">

<figdesc>Page 008.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
advice. Young folks always have discontented fits, you<lb>
know. Didn't you when you were a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn't wonder ef I did; but Enos came along,<lb>
and I forgot 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Enos has not come along yet, and never may;<lb>
so I 'm not going to sit and wait for any man to give me<lb>
independence, if I can earn it for myself.&rdquo; And a<lb>
quick glance at the gruff, gray old man in the corner<lb>
plainly betrayed that, in Christie's opinion, Aunt Betsey<lb>
made a bad bargain when she exchanged her girlish<lb>
aspirations for a man whose soul was in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest like her mother, full of hifalutin notions, discontented,<lb>
and sot in her own idees. Poor capital to<lb>
start a fortin' on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie's eye met that of her uncle peering over the<lb>
top of his paper with an expression that always tried<lb>
her patience. Now it was like a dash of cold water on<lb>
her enthusiasm, and her face fell as she asked quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that you are startin' all wrong; your redic'lus<lb>
notions about independence and self-cultur won't<lb>
come to nothin' in the long run, and you 'll make as bad<lb>
a failure of your life as your mother did of her'n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don't say that to me; I can't bear it, for <hi rend="italics">I</hi><lb>
shall never think her life a failure, because she tried to<lb>
help herself, and married a good man in spite of poverty,<lb>
when she loved him! You call that folly; but<lb>
I 'll do the same if I can; and I 'd rather have what my<lb>
father and mother left me, than all the money you are<lb>
piling up, just for the pleasure of being richer than<lb>
your neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear, he don't mean no harm!&rdquo; whispered<lb>
Aunt Betsey, fearing a storm.</p>
<pb n="009">

</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="1*">
<p>But though Christie's eyes had kindled and her color<lb>
deepened, her voice was low and steady, and her indignation<lb>
was of the inward sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle likes to try me by saying such things, and<lb>
this is one reason why I want to go away before I get<lb>
sharp and bitter and distrustful as he is. I don't suppose<lb>
I can make you understand my feeling, but I 'd<lb>
like to try, and then I 'll never speak of it again;&rdquo; and,<lb>
carefully controlling voice and face, Christie slowly<lb>
added, with a look that would have been pathetically<lb>
eloquent to one who could have understood the instincts<lb>
of a strong nature for light and freedom: &ldquo;You say I<lb>
am discontented, proud and ambitious; that 's true, and<lb>
I 'm glad of it. I am discontented, because I can't help<lb>
feeling that there is a better sort of life than this dull<lb>
one made up of everlasting work, with no object but<lb>
money. I can't starve my soul for the sake of my<lb>
body, and I mean to get out of the treadmill if I can.<lb>
I 'm proud, as you call it, because I hate dependence<lb>
where there isn't any love to make it bearable. You<lb>
don't say so in words, but I know you begrudge me a<lb>
home, though you will call me ungrateful when I 'm<lb>
gone. I 'm willing to work, but I want work that I can<lb>
put my heart into, and feel that it does me good, no<lb>
matter how hard it is. I only ask for a chance to be a<lb>
useful, happy woman, and I don't think that is a bad<lb>
ambition. Even if I only do what my dear mother did,<lb>
earn my living honestly and happily, and leave a beautiful<lb>
example behind me, to help one other woman as<lb>
hers helps me, I shall be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie's voice faltered over the last words, for the<lb>
thoughts and feelings which had been working within<lb>
<pb n="010">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-021">

<figdesc>Page 010.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her during the last few days had stirred her deeply, and<lb>
the resolution to cut loose from the old life had not<lb>
been lightly made. Mr. Devon had listened behind his<lb>
paper to this unusual outpouring with a sense of discomfort<lb>
which was new to him. But though the words<lb>
reproached and annoyed, they did not soften him, and<lb>
when Christie paused with tearful eyes, her uncle rose,<lb>
saying, slowly, as he lighted his candle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef I 'd refused to let you go before, I 'd agree to it<lb>
now; for you need breakin' in, my girl, and you are<lb>
goin' where you 'll get it, so the sooner you 're off the<lb>
better for all on us. Come, Betsey, we may as wal<lb>
leave, for we can't understand the wants of her higher<lb>
nater, as Christie calls it, and we 've had lecterin' enough<lb>
for one night.&rdquo; And with a grim laugh the old man<lb>
quitted the field, worsted but in good order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, dear, hev a good cry, and forgit all<lb>
about it!&rdquo; purred Aunt Betsey, as the heavy footsteps<lb>
creaked away, for the good soul had a most old-fashioned<lb>
and dutiful awe of her lord and master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan't cry but act; for it is high time I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> off.<lb>
I 've stayed for your sake; now I'm more trouble than<lb>
comfort, and away I go. Good-night, my dear old<lb>
Aunty, and don't look troubled, for I 'll be a lamb while<lb>
I stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having kissed the old lady, Christie swept her work<lb>
away, and sat down to write the letter which was the<lb>
first step toward freedom. When it was done, she<lb>
drew nearer to her friendly <hi rend="italics">confidante</hi> the fire, and till<lb>
late into the night sat thinking tenderly of the past,<lb>
bravely of the present, hopefully of the future. Twenty-one<lb>
to-morrow, and her inheritance a head, a heart, a<lb>

pair of hands; also the dower of most New England<lb>
girls, intelligence, courage, and common sense, many<lb>
practical gifts, and, hidden under the reserve that<lb>
soon melts in a genial atmosphere, much romance and<lb>
enthusiasm, and the spirit which can rise to heroism<lb>
when the great moment comes.</p>
<p>Christie was one of that large class of women who,<lb>
moderately endowed with talents, earnest and true-hearted,<lb>
are driven by necessity, temperament, or principle<lb>
out into the world to find support, happiness, and<lb>
homes for themselves. Many turn back discouraged;<lb>
more accept shadow for substance, and discover their<lb>
mistake too late; the weakest lose their purpose and<lb>
themselves; but the strongest struggle on, and, after<lb>
danger and defeat, earn at last the best success this<lb>
world can give us, the possession of a brave and cheerful<lb>
spirit, rich in self-knowledge, self-control, self-help.<lb>
This was the real desire of Christie's heart; this was to<lb>
be her lesson and reward, and to this happy end she<lb>
was slowly yet surely brought by the long discipline of<lb>
life and labor.</p>
<p>Sitting alone there in the night, she tried to strengthen<lb>
herself with all the good and helpful memories she<lb>
could recall, before she went away to find her place in<lb>
the great unknown world. She thought of her mother,<lb>
so like herself, who had borne the commonplace life of<lb>
home till she could bear it no longer.<lb>
Then had gone<lb>
away to teach, as most country girls are forced to do.<lb>
Had met, loved, and married a poor gentleman, and,<lb>
after a few years of genuine happiness, untroubled even<lb>
by much care and poverty, had followed him out of the<lb>
world, leaving her little child to the protection of her<lb>
brother.</p>

</p>
<p>Christie looked back over the long, lonely years she<lb>
had spent in the old farm-house, plodding to school and<lb>
church, and doing her tasks with kind Aunt Betsey<lb>
while a child; and slowly growing into girlhood, with<lb>
a world of romance locked up in a heart hungry for<lb>
love and a larger, nobler life.</p>
<p>She had tried to appease this hunger in many ways,<lb>
but found little help. Her father's old books were all<lb>
she could command, and these she wore out with much<lb>
reading. Inheriting his refined tastes, she found nothing<lb>
to attract her in the society of the commonplace<lb>
and often coarse people about her. She tried to like<lb>
the buxom girls whose one ambition was to &ldquo;get married,&rdquo;<lb>
and whose only subjects of conversation were<lb>
&ldquo;smart bonnets&rdquo; and &ldquo;nice dresses.&rdquo; She tried to<lb>
believe that the admiration and regard of the bluff<lb>
young farmers was worth striving for; but when one<lb>
well-to-do neighbor laid his acres at her feet, she found<lb>
it impossible to accept for her life's companion a man<lb>
whose soul was wrapped up in prize cattle and big<lb>
turnips.</p>
<p>Uncle Enos never could forgive her for this piece of<lb>
folly, and Christie plainly saw that one of three things<lb>
would surely happen, if she lived on there with no vent<lb>
for her full heart and busy mind. She would either<lb>
marry Joe Butterfield in sheer desperation, and become<lb>
a farmer's household drudge; settle down into a sour<lb>
spinster, content to make butter, gossip, and lay up<lb>
money all her days; or do what poor Matty Stone had<lb>
done, try to crush and curb her needs and aspirations<lb>
till the struggle grew too hard, and then in a fit of<lb>
despair end her life, and leave a tragic story to haunt<lb>
their quiet river.</p>

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>To escape these fates but one way appeared; to break<lb>
loose from this narrow life, go out into the world<lb>
and see what she could do for herself. This idea was<lb>
full of enchantment to the eager girl, and, after much<lb>
earnest thought, she had resolved to try it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I fail, I can come back,&rdquo; she said to herself, even<lb>
while she scorned the thought of failure, for with all<lb>
her shy pride she was both brave and ardent, and her<lb>
dreams were of the rosiest sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't marry Joe; I won't wear myself out in a<lb>
district-school for the mean sum they give a woman; I<lb>
won't delve away here where I 'm not wanted; and I<lb>
won't end my life like a coward, because it is dull and<lb>
hard. I 'll try my fate as mother did, and perhaps I<lb>
may succeed as well.&rdquo; And Christie's thoughts went<lb>
wandering away into the dim, sweet past when she, a<lb>
happy child, lived with loving parents in a different<lb>
world from that.</p>
<p>Lost in these tender memories, she sat till the old<lb>
moon-faced clock behind the door struck twelve, then<lb>
the visions vanished, leaving their benison behind them.</p>
<p>As she glanced backward at the smouldering fire, a<lb>
slender spire of flame shot up from the log that had<lb>
blazed so cheerily, and shone upon her as she went. A<lb>
good omen, gratefully accepted then, and remembered<lb>
often in the years to come.</p>

</p>
<p>A FORTNIGHT later, and Christie was off. Mrs.<lb>
Flint had briefly answered that she had a room,<lb>
and that work was always to be found in the city. So<lb>
the girl packed her one trunk, folding away splendid<lb>
hopes among her plain gowns, and filling every corner<lb>
with happy fancies, utterly impossible plans, and tender<lb>
little dreams, so lovely at the time, so pathetic to<lb>
remember, when contact with the hard realities of life<lb>
has collapsed our bright bubbles, and the frost of disappointment<lb>
nipped all our morning glories in their prime.</p>
<p>The old red stage stopped at Enos Devon's door,<lb>
and his niece crossed the threshold after a cool hand-shake<lb>
with the master of the house, and a close embrace<lb>
with the mistress, who stood pouring out last<lb>
words with spectacles too dim for seeing. Fat Ben<lb>
swung up the trunk, slammed the door, mounted his<lb>
perch, and the ancient vehicle swayed with premonitory<lb>
symptoms of departure.</p>
<p>Then something smote Christie's heart. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<lb>
she cried, and springing out ran back into the dismal<lb>
room where the old man sat. Straight up to him she<lb>
went with outstretched hand, saying steadily, though<lb>
her face was full of feeling:</p>
<pb n="015">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-026">

<figdesc>Page 015.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle, I 'm not satisfied with that good-bye. I<lb>
don't mean to be sentimental, but I do want to say,<lb>
`Forgive me!' I see now that I might have made you<lb>
sorry to part with me, if I had tried to make you love<lb>
me more. It 's too late now, but I 'm not too proud to<lb>
confess when I 'm wrong. I want to part kindly; I ask<lb>
your pardon; I thank you for all you 've done for me,<lb>
and I say good-bye affectionately now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Devon had a heart somewhere, though it seldom<lb>
troubled him; but it did make itself felt when the girl<lb>
looked at him with his dead sister's eyes, and spoke in<lb>
a tone whose unaccustomed tenderness was a reproach.</p>
<p>Conscience had pricked him more than once that<lb>
week, and he was glad to own it now; his rough sense<lb>
of honor was touched by her frank expression, and, as<lb>
he answered, his hand was offered readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that, Kitty, and think the better of you for 't.<lb>
Let bygones be bygones. I gen'lly got as good as I<lb>
give, and I guess I deserved some on 't. I wish you<lb>
wal, my girl, I heartily wish you wal, and hope you<lb>
won't forgit that the old house ain't never shet aginst<lb>
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie astonished him with a cordial kiss; then<lb>
bestowing another warm hug on Aunt Niobe, as she<lb>
called the old lady in a tearful joke, she ran into the<lb>
carriage, taking with her all the sunshine of the<lb>
place.</p>
<p>Christie found Mrs. Flint a dreary woman, with<lb>
&ldquo;boarders&rdquo; written all over her sour face and faded<lb>
figure. Butcher's bills and house rent seemed to fill<lb>
her eyes with sleepless anxiety; thriftless cooks and<lb>
saucy housemaids to sharpen the tones of her shrill<lb>
<pb n="016">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-027">

<figdesc>Page 016.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
voice; and an incapable husband to burden her shoulders<lb>
like a modern &ldquo;Old man of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little room far up in the tall house was at the girl's<lb>
disposal for a reasonable sum, and she took possession,<lb>
feeling very rich with the hundred dollars Uncle Enos<lb>
gave her, and delightfully independent, with no milkpans<lb>
to scald; no heavy lover to elude; no humdrum<lb>
district school to imprison her day after day.</p>
<p>For a week she enjoyed her liberty heartily, then set<lb>
about finding something to do. Her wish was to be a<lb>
governess, that being the usual refuge for respectable<lb>
girls who have a living to get. But Christie soon found<lb>
her want of accomplishments a barrier to success in<lb>
that line, for the mammas thought less of the solid than<lb>
of the ornamental branches, and wished their little darlings<lb>
to learn French before English, music before<lb>
grammar, and drawing before writing.</p>
<p>So, after several disappointments, Christie decided<lb>
that her education was too old-fashioned for the city,<lb>
and gave up the idea of teaching. Sewing she resolved<lb>
not to try till every thing else failed; and, after a few<lb>
more attempts to get writing to do, she said to herself,<lb>
in a fit of humility and good sense: &ldquo;I 'll begin at the<lb>
beginning, and work my way up. I 'll put my pride in<lb>
my pocket, and go out to service. Housework I like,<lb>
and can do well, thanks to Aunt Betsey. I never<lb>
thought it degradation to do it for her, so why should<lb>
I mind doing it for others if they pay for it? It isn't<lb>
what I want, but it 's better than idleness, so I 'll try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full of this wise resolution, she took to haunting that<lb>
purgatory of the poor, an intelligence office. Mrs.<lb>
Flint gave her a recommendation, and she hopefully<lb>
<pb n="017">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-028">

<figdesc>Page 017.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="B">
took her place among the ranks of buxom German,<lb>
incapable Irish, and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; American women; for in<lb>
those days foreign help had not driven farmers' daughters<lb>
out of the field, and made domestic comfort a lost<lb>
art.</p>
<p>At first Christie enjoyed the novelty of the thing,<lb>
and watched with interest the anxious housewives who<lb>
flocked in demanding that <hi rend="italics">rara avis,</hi> an angel at nine<lb>
shillings a week; and not finding it, bewailed the<lb>
degeneracy of the times. Being too honest to profess<lb>
herself absolutely perfect in every known branch of<lb>
house-work, it was some time before she suited herself.<lb>
Meanwhile, she was questioned and lectured, half engaged<lb>
and kept waiting, dismissed for a whim, and so<lb>
worried that she began to regard herself as the incarnation<lb>
of all human vanities and shortcomings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A desirable place in a small, genteel family,&rdquo; was at<lb>
last offered her, and she posted away to secure it, having<lb>
reached a state of desperation and resolved to go as a<lb>
first-class cook rather than sit with her hands before her<lb>
any longer.</p>
<p>A well-appointed house, good wages, and light duties<lb>
seemed things to be grateful for, and Christie decided<lb>
that going out to service was not the hardest fate in<lb>
life, as she stood at the door of a handsome house in a<lb>
sunny square waiting to be inspected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart, having just returned from Italy, affected<lb>
the artistic, and the new applicant found her with a<lb>
Roman searf about her head, a rosary like a string of<lb>
small cannon balls at her side, and azure draperies<lb>
which became her as well as they did the sea-green<lb>
furniture of her marine boudoir, where unwary walkers<lb>

tripped over coral and shells, grew sea-sick looking at<lb>
pictures of tempestuous billows engulfing every sort of<lb>
craft, from a man-of-war to a hencoop with a ghostly<lb>
young lady clinging to it with one hand, and had their<lb>
appetites effectually taken away by a choice collection<lb>
of water-bugs and snakes in a glass globe, that looked<lb>
like a jar of mixed pickles in a state of agitation.</p>

</p>
<p>Madame was intent on a water-color copy of Turner's<lb>
&ldquo;Rain, Wind, and Hail,&rdquo; that pleasing work which was<lb>
sold upsidedown and no one found it out. Motioning<lb>
Christie to a seat she finished some delicate sloppy<lb>
process before speaking. In that little pause Christie<lb>
examined her, and the impression then received was<lb>
afterward confirmed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart possessed some beauty and chose to think<lb>
herself a queen of society. She assumed majestic manners<lb>
in public and could not entirely divest herself of<lb>
them in private, which often produced comic effects.<lb>
Zenobia troubled about fish-sauce, or Aspasia indignant<lb>
at the price of eggs will give some idea of this lady<lb>
when she condescended to the cares of housekeeping.</p>
<p>Presently she looked up and inspected the girl as if<lb>
a new servant were no more than a new bonnet, a<lb>
necessary article to be ordered home for examination.<lb>
Christie presented her recommendation, made her modest<lb>
little speech, and awaited her doom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart read, listened, and then demanded with<lb>
queenly brevity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie Devon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too long; I should prefer to call you Jane as I am<lb>
accustomed to the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart gazed into space a moment, then delivered<lb>
the following address with impressive solemnity.</p>
<pb n="020">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-031">

<figdesc>Page 020.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish a capable, intelligent, honest, neat, well-conducted<lb>
person who knows her place and keeps it. The<lb>
work is light, as there are but two in the family. I am<lb>
very particular and so is Mr. Stuart. I pay two dollars<lb>
and a half, allow one afternoon out, one service on Sunday,<lb>
and no followers. My table-girl must understand<lb>
her duties thoroughly, be extremely neat, and always<lb>
wear white aprons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can suit you, ma'am, when I have learned<lb>
the ways of the house,&rdquo; meekly replied Christie.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart looked graciously satisfied and returned<lb>
the paper with a gesture that Victoria might have used<lb>
in restoring a granted petition, though her next words<lb>
rather marred the effect of the regal act, &ldquo;My cook is<lb>
black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no objection to color, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expression of relief dawned upon Mrs. Stuart's<lb>
countenance, for the black cook had been an insurmountable<lb>
obstacle to all the Irish ladies who had<lb>
applied. Thoughtfully tapping her Roman nose with<lb>
the handle of her brush Madame took another survey<lb>
of the new applicant, and seeing that she looked neat,<lb>
intelligent, and respectful, gave a sigh of thankfulness<lb>
and engaged her on the spot.</p>
<p>Much elated Christie rushed home, selected a bag of<lb>
necessary articles, bundled the rest of her possessions<lb>
into an empty closet (lent her rent-free owing to a profusion<lb>
of cockroaches), paid up her board, and at two<lb>
o'clock introduced herself to Hepsey Johnson, her fellow<lb>
servant.</p>
<p>Hepsey was a tall, gaunt woman, bearing the tragedy<lb>
of her race written in her face, with its melancholy<lb>
<pb n="021">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-032">

<figdesc>Page 021.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
eyes, subdued expression, and the pathetic patience of<lb>
a wronged dumb animal. She received Christie with<lb>
an air of resignation, and speedily bewildered her with<lb>
an account of the duties she would be expected to perform.<lb>
</p>
<p>A long and careful drill enabled Christie to set the<lb>
table with but few mistakes, and to retain a tolerably<lb>
clear recollection of the order of performances. She<lb>
had just assumed her badge of servitude, as she called<lb>
the white apron, when the bell rang violently and Hepsey,<lb>
who was hurrying away to &ldquo;dish up,&rdquo; said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's de marster. You has to answer de bell, honey,<lb>
and he likes it done bery spry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie ran and admitted an impetuous, stout gentleman,<lb>
who appeared to be incensed against the elements,<lb>
for he burst in as if blown, shook himself like a Newfoundland<lb>
dog, and said all in one breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You 're the new girl, are you? Well, take my<lb>
umbrella and pull off my rubbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart was struggling with his gloves, and, quite<lb>
unconscious of the astonishment of his new maid, impatiently<lb>
repeated his request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this wet thing away, and pull off my overshoes.<lb>
Don't you see it 's raining like the very<lb>
deuce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie folded her lips together in a peculiar manner<lb>
as she knelt down and removed a pair of muddy overshoes,<lb>
took the dripping umbrella, and was walking<lb>
away with her agreeable burden when Mr. Stuart gave<lb>
her another shock by calling over the banister:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm going out again; so clean those rubbers, and<lb>
<pb n="022">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-033">

<figdesc>Page 022.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
see that the boots I sent down this morning are in<lb>
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Christie meekly, and immediately<lb>
afterward startled Hepsey by casting overshoes<lb>
and umbrella upon the kitchen floor, and indignantly<lb>
demanding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I expected to be a boot-jack to that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'spects you is, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I also expected to clean his boots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, chile. Katy did, and de work ain't hard when<lb>
you gits used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn't the work; it 's the degradation; and I won't<lb>
submit to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie looked fiercely determined; but Hepsey<lb>
shook her head, saying quietly as she went on garnishing<lb>
a dish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere 's more 'gradin' works dan dat, chile, and dem<lb>
dat 's bin 'bliged to do um finds dis sort bery easy.<lb>
You 's paid for it, honey; and if you does it willin, it<lb>
won't hurt you more dan washin' de marster's dishes, or<lb>
sweepin' his rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be a boy to do this sort of thing.<lb>
<hi rend="italics">Do</hi> you think it 's right to ask it of me?&rdquo; cried Christie,<lb>
feeling that being servant was not as pleasant a task as<lb>
she had thought it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno, chile. I 'se shore I 'd never ask it of any<lb>
woman if I was a man, 'less I was sick or ole. But<lb>
folks don't seem to 'member dat we 've got feelin's, and<lb>
de best way is not to mind dese ere little trubbles.<lb>
You jes leave de boots to me; blackin' can't do dese<lb>
ole hands no hurt, and dis ain't no deggydation to me<lb>
now; I 's a free woman.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="023">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-034">

<figdesc>Page 023.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hepsey, were you ever a slave?&rdquo; asked the<lb>
girl, forgetting her own small injury at this suggestion<lb>
of the greatest of all wrongs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my life, till I run away five year ago. My ole<lb>
folks, and eight brudders and sisters, is down dere in de<lb>
pit now, waitin' for the Lord to set 'em free. And He 's<lb>
gwine to do it soon, <hi rend="italics">soon!</hi>&rdquo; As she uttered the last<lb>
words, a sudden light chased the tragic shadow from<lb>
Hepsey's face, and the solemn fervor of her voice<lb>
thrilled Christie's heart. All her anger died out in a<lb>
great pity, and she put her hand on the woman's shoulder,<lb>
saying earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so; and I wish I could help to bring that<lb>
happy day at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Hepsey smiled, as she said gratefully,<lb>
&ldquo;De Lord bress you for dat wish, chile.&rdquo; Then,<lb>
dropping suddenly into her old, quiet way, she added,<lb>
turning to her work:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you tote up de dinner, and I 'll be handy by to'<lb>
fresh your mind 'bout how de dishes goes, for missis is<lb>
bery 'ticular, and don't like no 'stakes in tendin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to her own neat-handed ways and Hepsey's<lb>
prompting through the slide, Christie got on very well;<lb>
managed her salver dexterously, only upset one glass,<lb>
clashed one dish-cover, and forgot to sugar the pie<lb>
before putting it on the table; an omission which was<lb>
majestically pointed out, and graciously pardoned as a<lb>
first offence.</p>
<p>By seven o'clock the ceremonial was fairly over, and<lb>
Christie dropped into a chair quite tired out with frequent<lb>
pacings to and fro. In the kitchen she found the<lb>
table spread for one, and Hepsey busy with the boots.</p>
<pb n="024">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-035">

<figdesc>Page 024.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren't you coming to your dinner, Mrs. Johnson?&rdquo;<lb>
she asked, not pleased at the arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you 's done, honey; dere 's no hurry 'bout me.<lb>
Katy liked dat way best, and I 'se used ter waitin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <hi rend="italics">I</hi> don't like that way, and I won't have it. I<lb>
suppose Katy thought her white skin gave her a right<lb>
to be disrespectful to a woman old enough to be her<lb>
mother just because she was black. I don't; and while<lb>
I 'm here, there must be no difference made. If we can<lb>
work together, we can eat together; and because you<lb>
have been a slave is all the more reason I should be<lb>
good to you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Hepsey had been surprised by the new girl's protest<lb>
against being made a boot-jack of, she was still<lb>
more surprised at this sudden kindness, for she had set<lb>
Christie down in her own mind as &ldquo;one ob dem toppin'<lb>
smart ones dat don't stay long nowheres.&rdquo; She changed<lb>
her opinion now, and sat watching the girl with a new<lb>
expression on her face, as Christie took boot and brush<lb>
from her, and fell to work energetically, saying as she<lb>
scrubbed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm ashamed of complaining about such a little<lb>
thing as this, and don't mean to feel degraded by it,<lb>
though I should by letting you do it for me. I never<lb>
lived out before: that 's the reason I made a fuss.<lb>
There 's a polish, for you, and I 'm in a good humor<lb>
again; so Mr. Stuart may call for his boots whenever<lb>
he likes, and we 'll go to dinner like fashionable people,<lb>
as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so irresistible in the girl's hearty<lb>
manner, that Hepsey submitted at once with a visible<lb>
satisfaction, which gave a relish to Christie's dinner,<lb>
<pb n="025">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-036">

<figdesc>Page 025.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="2">
though it was eaten at a kitchen table, with a bare-armed<lb>
cook sitting opposite, and three rows of burnished<lb>
dish-covers reflecting the dreadful spectacle.</p>
<p>After this, Christie got on excellently, for she did her<lb>
best, and found both pleasure and profit in her new<lb>
employment. It gave her real satisfaction to keep the<lb>
handsome rooms in order, to polish plate, and spread<lb>
bountiful meals. There was an atmosphere of ease<lb>
and comfort about her which contrasted agreeably with<lb>
the shabbiness of Mrs. Flint's boarding-house, and the<lb>
bare simplicity of the old home. Like most young<lb>
people, Christie loved luxury, and was sensible enough<lb>
to see and value the comforts of her situation, and to<lb>
wonder why more girls placed as she was did not<lb>
choose a life like this rather than the confinements of a<lb>
sewing-room, or the fatigue and publicity of a shop.</p>
<p>She did not learn to love her mistress, because Mrs.<lb>
Stuart evidently considered herself as one belonging to<lb>
a superior race of beings, and had no desire to establish<lb>
any of the friendly relations that may become so helpful<lb>
and pleasant to both mistress and maid. She made<lb>
a royal progress through her dominions every morning,<lb>
issued orders, found fault liberally, bestowed praise<lb>
sparingly, and took no more personal interest in her servants<lb>
than if they were clocks, to be wound up once a<lb>
day, and sent away the moment they got out of repair.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart was absent from morning till night, and<lb>
all Christie ever knew about him was that he was a<lb>
kind-hearted, hot-tempered, and very conceited man;<lb>
fond of his wife, proud of the society they managed to<lb>
draw about them, and bent on making his way in the<lb>
world at any cost.</p>

</p>
<p>If masters and mistresses knew how skilfully they<lb>
are studied, criticised, and imitated by their servants,<lb>
they would take more heed to their ways, and set<lb>
better examples, perhaps. Mrs. Stuart never dreamed<lb>
that her quiet, respectful Jane kept a sharp eye on all<lb>
her movements, smiled covertly at her affectations,<lb>
envied her accomplishments, and practised certain little<lb>
elegancies that struck her fancy.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart would have become apoplectic with indignation<lb>
if he had known that this too intelligent table-girl<lb>
often contrasted her master with his guests, and<lb>
dared to think him wanting in good breeding when he<lb>
boasted of his money, flattered a great man, or laid<lb>
plans to lure some lion into his house. When he lost<lb>
his temper, she always wanted to laugh, he bounced<lb>
and bumbled about so like an angry blue-bottle fly;<lb>
and when he got himself up elaborately for a party,<lb>
this disrespectful hussy confided to Hepsey her opinion<lb>
that &ldquo;master was a fat dandy, with nothing to be vain<lb>
of but his clothes,&rdquo; &mdash; a sacrilegious remark which<lb>
would have caused her to be summarily ejected from<lb>
the house if it had reached the august ears of master<lb>
or mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was a gentleman; and I shall never forget<lb>
it, though I do go out to service. I 've got no rich<lb>
friends to help me up, but, sooner or later, I mean to<lb>
find a place among cultivated people; and while I'm<lb>
working and waiting, I can be fitting myself to fill that<lb>
place like a gentlewoman, as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this ambition in her mind, Christie took notes<lb>
of all that went on in the polite world, of which she<lb>
got frequent glimpses while &ldquo;living out.&rdquo; Mrs. Stuart<lb>
<pb n="027">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-038">

<figdesc>Page 027.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
received one evening of each week, and on these occasions<lb>
Christie, with an extra frill on her white apron,<lb>
served the company, and enjoyed herself more than<lb>
they did, if the truth had been known.</p>
<p>While helping the ladies with their wraps, she<lb>
observed what they wore, how they carried themselves,<lb>
and what a vast amount of prinking they did,<lb>
not to mention the flood of gossip they talked while<lb>
shaking out their flounces and settling their topknots.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, when she passed cups and<lb>
glasses, this demure-looking damsel heard much fine<lb>
discourse, saw many famous beings, and improved her<lb>
mind with surreptitious studies of the rich and great<lb>
when on parade. But her best time was after supper,<lb>
when, through the crack of the door of the little room<lb>
where she was supposed to be clearing away the relics<lb>
of the feast, she looked and listened at her ease;<lb>
laughed at the wits, stared at the lions, heard the music,<lb>
was impressed by the wisdom, and much edified by the<lb>
gentility of the whole affair.</p>
<p>After a time, however, Christie got rather tired of it,<lb>
for there was an elegant sameness about these evenings<lb>
that became intensely wearisome to the uninitiated, but<lb>
she fancied that as each had his part to play he managed<lb>
to do it with spirit. Night after night the wag<lb>
told his stories, the poet read his poems, the singers<lb>
warbled, the pretty women simpered and dressed, the<lb>
heavy scientific was duly discussed by the elect precious,<lb>
and Mrs. Stuart, in amazing costumes, sailed to and for<lb>
in her most swan-like manner; while my lord stirred<lb>
up the lions he had captured, till they roared their best,<lb>
great and small.</p>

<figdesc>445EAF. Page 028. In-line image of a man named Hepsey, who is wearing a kerchief tied
around his scalp.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! why don't they do or say something<lb>
new and interesting, and not keep twaddling on about<lb>
art, and music, and poetry, and cosmos? The papers<lb>
are full of appeals for help for the poor, reforms of all<lb>
sorts, and splendid work that others are doing; but<lb>
these people seem to think it isn't genteel enough to be<lb>
spoken of here. I suppose it as all very elegant to go<lb>
on like a set of trained cauaries, but it 's very dull fun<lb>
to watch them, and Hepsey's stories are a deal more<lb>
interesting to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion, after studying dilettanteism<lb>
through the crack of the door for some months,<lb>
Christie left the &ldquo;trained canaries&rdquo; to twitter and hop<lb>
about their gilded cage, and devoted herself to Hepsey,<lb>
who gave her glimpses into another sort of life so bitterly<lb>
real that she never could forget it.</p>
<p>Friendship had prospered in the lower regions, for<lb>
Hepsey had a motherly heart, and Christie soon won<lb>
<pb n="029">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-040">

<figdesc>Page 029.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her confidence by bestowing her own. Her story was<lb>
like many another; yet, being the first Christie had<lb>
ever heard, and told with the unconscious eloquence of<lb>
one who had suffered and escaped, it made a deep impression<lb>
on her, bringing home to her a sense of obligation<lb>
so forcibly that she began at once to pay a little<lb>
part of the great debt which the white race owes the<lb>
black.</p>
<p>Christie loved books; and the attic next her own was<lb>
full of them. To this store she found her way by a sort<lb>
of instinct as sure as that which leads a fly to a honey-pot,<lb>
and, finding many novels, she read her fill. This<lb>
amusement lightened many heavy hours, peopled the<lb>
silent house with troops of friends, and, for a time, was<lb>
the joy of her life.</p>
<p>Hepsey used to watch her as she sat buried in her<lb>
book when the day's work was done, and once a heavy<lb>
sigh roused Christie from the most exciting crisis of<lb>
&ldquo;The Abbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the matter? Are you very tired, Aunty?&rdquo;<lb>
she asked, using the name that came most readily to<lb>
her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, honey; I was only wishin' I could read fast<lb>
like you does. I 's berry slow 'bout readin' and I want<lb>
to learn a heap,&rdquo; answered Hepsey, with such a wistful<lb>
look in her soft eyes that Christie shut her book, saying<lb>
briskly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I 'll teach you. Bring out your primer and<lb>
let 's begin at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear chile, it 's orful hard work to put learnin' in<lb>
my ole head, and I wouldn't 'cept such a ting from you<lb>
only I needs dis sort of help so bad, and I can trust you<lb>
to gib it to me as I wants it.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="030">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-041">

<figdesc>Page 030.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Then in a whisper that went straight to Christie's<lb>
heart, Hepsey told her plan and showed what help she<lb>
craved.</p>
<p>For five years she had worked hard, and saved her<lb>
earnings for the purpose of her life. When a considerable<lb>
sum had been hoarded up, she confided it to one<lb>
whom she believed to be a friend, and sent him to buy<lb>
her old mother. But he proved false, and she never<lb>
saw either mother or money. It was a hard blow, but<lb>
she took heart and went to work again, resolving this<lb>
time to trust no one with the dangerous part of the<lb>
affair, but when she had scraped together enough to pay<lb>
her way she meant to go South and steal her mother at<lb>
the risk of her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't want much money, but I must know little'<lb>
bout readin' and countin' up, else I'll get lost and<lb>
cheated. You'll help me do dis, honey, and I'll bless<lb>
you all my days, and so will my old mammy, if I ever<lb>
gets her safe away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With tears of sympathy shining on her cheeks, and<lb>
both hands stretched out to the poor soul who implored<lb>
this small boon of her, Christie promised all the help<lb>
that in her lay, and kept her word religiously.</p>
<p>From that time, Hepsey's cause was hers; she laid<lb>
by a part of her wages for &ldquo;ole mammy,&rdquo; she comforted<lb>
Hepsey with happy prophecies of success, and<lb>
taught with an energy and skill she had never known<lb>
before. Novels lost their charms now, for Hepsey could<lb>
give her a comedy and tragedy surpassing any thing<lb>
she found in them, because truth stamped her tales with<lb>
a power and pathos the most gifted fancy could but<lb>
poorly imitate.</p>
<pb n="031">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-042">

<figdesc>Page 031.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The select receptions upstairs seemed duller than<lb>
ever to her now, and her happiest evenings were spent<lb>
in the tidy kitchen, watching Hepsey laboriously shaping<lb>
A's and B's, or counting up on her worn fingers the<lb>
wages they had earned by months of weary work, that<lb>
she might purchase one treasure, &mdash; a feeble, old woman,<lb>
worn out with seventy years of slavery far away there<lb>
in Virginia.</p>
<p>For a year Christie was a faithful servant to her<lb>
mistress, who appreciated her virtues, but did not<lb>
encourage them; a true friend to poor Hepsey, who<lb>
loved her dearly, and found in her sympathy and affection<lb>
a solace for many griefs and wrongs. But Providence<lb>
had other lessons for Christie, and when this one<lb>
was well learned she was sent away to learn another<lb>
phase of woman's life and labor.</p>
<p>While their domestics amused themselves with privy<lb>
conspiracy and rebellion at home, Mr. and Mrs. Stuart<lb>
spent their evenings in chasing that bright bubble<lb>
called social success, and usually came home rather<lb>
cross because they could not catch it.</p>
<p>On one of these occasions they received a warm<lb>
welcome, for, as they approached the house, smoke was<lb>
seen issuing from an attic window, and flames flickering<lb>
behind the half-drawn curtain. Bursting out of the<lb>
carriage with his usual impetuosity, Mr. Stuart let himself<lb>
in and tore upstairs shouting &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; like an<lb>
engine company.</p>
<p>In the attic Christie was discovered lying dressed<lb>
upon her bed, asleep or suffocated by the smoke that<lb>
filled the room. A book had slipped from her hand,<lb>
and in falling had upset the candle on a chair beside<lb>
<pb n="032">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-043">

<figdesc>Page 032.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her; the long wick leaned against a cotton gown hanging<lb>
on the wall, and a greater part of Christie's wardrobe<lb>
was burning brilliantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbade her to keep the gas lighted so late, and<lb>
see what the deceitful creature has done with her private<lb>
candle!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Stuart with a shrillness that<lb>
roused the girl from her heavy sleep more effectually<lb>
than the anathemas Mr. Stuart was fulminating against<lb>
the fire.</p>
<p>Sitting up she looked dizzily about her. The smoke<lb>
was clearing fast, a window having been opened; and<lb>
the tableau was a striking one. Mr. Stuart with an<lb>
excited countenance was dancing frantically on a heap<lb>
of half-consumed clothes pulled from the wall. He had<lb>
not only drenched them with water from bowl and<lb>
pitcher, but had also cast those articles upon the pile<lb>
like extinguishers, and was skipping among the fragments<lb>
with an agility which contrasted with his stout<lb>
figure in full evening costume, and his besmirched face,<lb>
made the sight irresistibly ludicrous.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart, though in her most regal array, seemed<lb>
to have left her dignity downstairs with her opera<lb>
cloak, for with skirts gathered closely about her, tiara<lb>
all askew, and face full of fear and anger, she stood<lb>
upon a chair and scolded like any shrew.</p>
<p>The comic overpowered the tragic, and being a little<lb>
hysterical with the sudden alarm, Christie broke into a<lb>
peal of laughter that sealed her fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at her! look at her!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Stuart gesticulating<lb>
on her perch as if about to fly. &ldquo;She has been<lb>
at the wine, or lost her wits. She must go, Horatio,<lb>
she must go! I cannot have my nerves shattered by<lb>
<pb n="033">

<figdesc>Page 033.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="2* c">
such dreadful scenes. She is too fond of books, and it<lb>
has turned her brain. Hepsey can watch her to-night,<lb>
and at dawn she shall leave the house for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till after breakfast, my dear. Let us have that<lb>
in comfort I beg, for upon my soul we shall need it,&rdquo;<lb>
panted Mr. Stuart, sinking into a chair exhausted with<lb>
the vigorous measures which had quenched the conflagration.<lb>
</p>
<p>Christie checked her untimely mirth, explained the<lb>
probable cause of the mischief, and penitently promised<lb>
to be more careful for the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart would have pardoned her on the spot, but<lb>
Madame was inexorable, for she had so completely forgotten<lb>
her dignity that she felt it would be impossible<lb>
ever to recover it in the eyes of this disrespectful<lb>
menial. Therefore she dismissed her with a lecture<lb>
that made both mistress and maid glad to part.</p>
<p>She did not appear at breakfast, and after that meal<lb>
Mr. Stuart paid Christie her wages with a solemnity<lb>
which proved that he had taken a curtain lecture to<lb>
heart. There was a twinkle in his eye, however, as he<lb>
kindly added a recommendation, and after the door<lb>
closed behind him Christie was sure that he exploded<lb>
into a laugh at the recollection of his last night's performance.<lb>
</p>
<p>This lightened her sense of disgrace very much, so,<lb>
leaving a part of her money to repair damages, she<lb>
packed up her dilapidated wardrobe, and, making Hepsey<lb>
promise to report progress from time to time, Christie<lb>
went back to Mrs. Flint's to compose her mind and<lb>
be ready <hi rend="italics">&agrave; la</hi> Micawber &ldquo;for something to turn up.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>FEELING that she had all the world before her<lb>
where to choose, and that her next step ought to<lb>
take her up at least one round higher on the ladder she<lb>
was climbing, Christie decided not to try going out to<lb>
service again. She knew very well that she would<lb>
never live with Irish mates, and could not expect to<lb>
find another Hepsey. So she tried to get a place as<lb>
companion to an invalid, but failed to secure the only<lb>
situation of the sort that was offered her, because she<lb>
mildly objected to waiting on a nervous cripple all day,<lb>
and reading aloud half the night. The old lady called<lb>
her an &ldquo;impertinent baggage,&rdquo; and Christie retired in<lb>
great disgust, resolving not to be a slave to anybody.</p>
<p>Things seldom turn out as we plan them, and after<lb>
much waiting and hoping for other work Christie at<lb>
last accepted about the only employment which had<lb>
not entered her mind.</p>
<p>Among the boarders at Mrs. Flint's were an old lady<lb>
and her pretty daughter, both actresses at a respectable<lb>
theatre. Not stars by any means, but good second-rate<lb>
players, doing their work creditably and earning an<lb>
honest living. The mother had been kind to Christie<lb>
in offering advice, and sympathizing with her<lb>
<pb n="035">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-046">

<figdesc>Page 035.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
disappointments. The daughter, a gay little lass, had taken<lb>
Christie to the theatre several times, there to behold<lb>
her in all the gauzy glories that surround the nymphs<lb>
of spectacular romance.</p>
<p>To Christie this was a great delight, for, though she<lb>
had pored over her father's Shakespeare till she knew<lb>
many scenes by heart, she had never seen a play till<lb>
Lucy led her into what seemed an enchanted world.<lb>
Her interest and admiration pleased the little actress,<lb>
and sundry lifts when she was hurried with her dresses<lb>
made her grateful to Christie.</p>
<p>The girl's despondent face, as she came in day after<lb>
day from her unsuccessful quest, told its own story,<lb>
though she uttered no complaint, and these friendly<lb>
souls laid their heads together, eager to help her in<lb>
their own dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've got it! I've got it! All hail to the queen!&rdquo;<lb>
was the cry that one day startled Christie as she sat<lb>
thinking anxiously, while sewing mock-pearls on a<lb>
crown for Mrs. Black.</p>
<p>Looking up she saw Lucy just home from rehearsal,<lb>
going through a series of pantomimic evolutions suggestive<lb>
of a warrior doing battle with incredible valor,<lb>
and a very limited knowledge of the noble art of self-defence.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got? Who is the queen?&rdquo; she<lb>
asked, laughing, as the breathless hero lowered her<lb>
umbrella, and laid her bonnet at Christie's feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">You</hi> are to be the Queen of the Amazons in our<lb>
new spectacle, at half a dollar a night for six or eight<lb>
weeks, if the piece goes well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Christie, with a gasp.</p>
<pb n="036">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-047">

<figdesc>Page 036.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Lucy, clapping her hands; and then<lb>
she proceeded to tell her news with theatrical volubility.<lb>
&ldquo;Mr. Sharp, the manager, wants a lot of tallish<lb>
girls, and I told him I knew of a perfect dear. He<lb>
said: `Bring her on, then,' and I flew home to tell you.<lb>
Now, don't look wild, and say no. You've only got to<lb>
sing in one chorus, march in the grand procession, and<lb>
lead your band in the terrific battle-scene. The dress<lb>
is splendid! Red tunic, tiger-skin over shoulder, helmet,<lb>
shield, lance, fleshings, sandals, hair down, and as much<lb>
cork to your eyebrows as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie certainly did look wild, for Lucy had burst<lb>
into the room like a small hurricane, and her rapid<lb>
words rattled about the listeners' ears as if a hail-storm<lb>
had followed the gust. While Christie still sat with<lb>
her mouth open, too bewildered to reply, Mrs. Black<lb>
said in her cosey voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it, me dear, it 's just what you 'll enjoy, and a<lb>
capital beginning I assure ye; for if you do well old<lb>
Sharp will want you again, and then, when some one<lb>
slips out of the company, you can slip in, and there you<lb>
are quite comfortable. Try it, me dear, and if you<lb>
don't like it drop it when the piece is over, and there's<lb>
no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's much easier and jollier than any of the things<lb>
you are after. We 'll stand by you like bricks, and in a<lb>
week you 'll say it 's the best lark you ever had in your<lb>
life. Don't be prim, now, but say yes, like a trump, as<lb>
you are,&rdquo; added Lucy, waving a pink satin train temptingly<lb>
before her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try it!&rdquo; said Christie, with sudden decision,<lb>
feeling that something entirely new and absorbing was<lb>
<pb n="037">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-048">

<figdesc>Page 037.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
what she needed to expend the vigor, romance, and<lb>
enthusiasm of her youth upon.</p>
<p>With a shriek of delight Lucy swept her off her<lb>
chair, and twirled her about the room as excitable<lb>
young ladies are fond of doing when their joyful emotions<lb>
need a vent. When both were giddy they subsided<lb>
into a corner and a breathless discussion of the<lb>
important step.</p>
<p>Though she had consented, Christie had endless<lb>
doubts and fears, but Lucy removed many of the former,<lb>
and her own desire for pleasant employment conquered<lb>
many of the latter. In her most despairing moods she<lb>
had never thought of trying this. Uncle Enos considered<lb>
&ldquo;play-actin&rdquo;' as the sum of all iniquity. What<lb>
would he say if she went calmly to destruction by that<lb>
road? Sad to relate, this recollection rather strengthened<lb>
her purpose, for a delicious sense of freedom pervaded<lb>
her soul, and the old defiant spirit seemed to rise<lb>
up within her at the memory of her Uncle's grim<lb>
prophecies and narrow views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy is happy, virtuous, and independent, why can't<lb>
I be so too if I have any talent? It isn't exactly what<lb>
I should choose, but any thing honest is better than<lb>
idleness. I'll try it any way, and get a little fun, even<lb>
if I don't make much money or glory out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Christie held to her resolution in spite of many<lb>
secret misgivings, and followed Mrs. Black's advice on<lb>
all points with a docility which caused that sanguine<lb>
lady to predict that she would be a star before she<lb>
knew where she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the stage? How dusty and dull it is by<lb>
daylight!&rdquo; said Christie next day, as she stood by Lucy<lb>
<pb n="038">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-049">

<figdesc>Page 038.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
on the very spot where she had seen Hamlet die in<lb>
great anguish two nights before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, child, it 's in curl-papers now, as I am of<lb>
a morning. Mr. Sharp, here 's an Amazon for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Lucy hurried across the stage, followed<lb>
by Christie, wearing any thing but an Amazonian<lb>
expression just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever on before?&rdquo; abruptly asked a keen-faced,<lb>
little man, glancing with an experienced eye at the<lb>
young person who stood before him bathed in blushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dance, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just take a turn across the stage, will you? Must<lb>
walk well to lead a march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she went, Christie heard Mr. Sharp taking notes<lb>
audibly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good tread; capital figure; fine eye. She 'll make<lb>
up well, and behave herself, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strong desire to make off seized the girl; but,<lb>
remembering that she had presented herself for inspection,<lb>
she controlled the impulse, and returned to him<lb>
with no demonstration of displeasure, but a little more<lb>
fire in &ldquo;the fine eye,&rdquo; and a more erect carriage of the<lb>
&ldquo;capital figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my dear. Give your name to Mr. Tripp,<lb>
and your mind to the business, and consider yourself<lb>
engaged,&rdquo; &mdash; with which satisfactory remark the little<lb>
man vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy, did you hear that impertinent `my dear'?&rdquo;<lb>
<pb n="039">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-050">

<figdesc>Page 039.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
asked Christie, whose sense of propriety had received<lb>
its first shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, child, all managers do it. They don't mean<lb>
any thing; so be resigned, and thank your stars he<lb>
didn't say `love' and `darling,' and kiss you, as old<lb>
Vining used to,&rdquo; was all the sympathy she got.</p>
<p>Having obeyed orders, Lucy initiated her into the<lb>
mysteries of the place, and then put her in a corner to<lb>
look over the scenes in which she was to appear. Christie<lb>
soon caught the idea of her part, &mdash; not a difficult<lb>
matter, as there were but few ideas in the whole piece,<lb>
after which she sat watching the arrival of the troop<lb>
she was to lead. A most forlorn band of warriors they<lb>
seemed, huddled together, and looking as if afraid to<lb>
speak, lest they should infringe some rule; or to move,<lb>
lest they be swallowed up by some unsuspected trapdoor.<lb>
</p>
<p>Presently the ballet-master appeared, the orchestra<lb>
struck up, and Christie found herself marching and<lb>
counter-marching at word of command. At first, a<lb>
most uncomfortable sense of the absurdity of her position<lb>
oppressed and confused her; then the ludicrous<lb>
contrast between the solemn anxiety of the troop and<lb>
the fantastic evolutions they were performing amused<lb>
her till the novelty wore off; the martial music excited<lb>
her; the desire to please sharpened her wits; and<lb>
natural grace made it easy for her to catch and copy<lb>
the steps and poses given her to imitate. Soon she<lb>
forgot herself, entered into the spirit of the thing, and<lb>
exerted every sense to please, so successfully that Mr.<lb>
Tripp praised her quickness at comprehension, Lucy<lb>
applauded heartily from a fairy car, and Mr. Sharp<lb>
<pb n="040">

</eaffig>
popped his head out of a palace window to watch the<lb>
Amazon's descent from the Mountains of the Moon.</p>
<p>When the regular company arrived, the troop was<lb>
dismissed till the progress of the play demanded their<lb>
reappearance. Much interested in the piece, Christie<lb>
stood aside under a palm-tree, the foliage of which was<lb>
strongly suggestive of a dilapidated green umbrella,<lb>
enjoying the novel sights and sounds about her.</p>
<p>Yellow-faced gentlemen and sleepy-eyed ladies roamed<lb>
languidly about with much incoherent jabbering of<lb>
parts, and frequent explosions of laughter. Princes,<lb>
with varnished boots and suppressed cigars, fought,<lb>
bled, and died, without a change of countenance.<lb>
Damsels of unparalleled beauty, according to the text,<lb>
gaped in the faces of adoring lovers, and crocheted<lb>
serenely on the brink of annihilation. Fairies, in rubber-boots<lb>
and woollen head-gear, disported themselves<lb>
on flowery barks of canvas, or were suspended aloft<lb>
with hooks in their backs like young Hindoo devotees.<lb>
Demons, guiltless of hoof or horn, clutched their victims<lb>
with the inevitable &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; and vanished darkly,<lb>
eating pea-nuts. The ubiquitous Mr. Sharp seemed to<lb>
pervade the whole theatre; for his voice came shrilly<lb>
from above or spectrally from below, and his active<lb>
little figure darted to and fro like a critical will-o-the-wisp.<lb>
</p>
<p>The grand march and chorus in the closing scene<lb>
were easily accomplished; for, as Lucy bade her, Christie<lb>
&ldquo;sung with all her might,&rdquo; and kept step as she led<lb>
her band with the dignity of a Boadicea. No one<lb>
spoke to her; few observed her; all were intent on<lb>
their own affairs; and when the final shriek and bang<lb>
<pb n="041">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-052">

<figdesc>Page 041.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
died away without lifting the roof by its din, she could<lb>
hardly believe that the dreaded first rehearsal was<lb>
safely over.</p>
<p>A visit to the wardrobe-room to see her dress came<lb>
next; and here Christie had a slight skirmish with the<lb>
mistress of that department relative to the length of<lb>
her classical garments. As studies from the nude had<lb>
not yet become one of the amusements of the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lite</hi> of<lb>
Little Babel, Christie was not required to appear in the<lb>
severe simplicity of a costume consisting of a necklace,<lb>
sandals, and a bit of gold fringe about the waist, but<lb>
was allowed an extra inch or two on her tunic, and<lb>
departed, much comforted by the assurance that her<lb>
dress would not be &ldquo;a shock to modesty,&rdquo; as Lucy<lb>
expressed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look at yourself, and, for my sake, prove an<lb>
honor to your country and a terror to the foe,&rdquo; said<lb>
Lucy, as she led her <hi rend="italics">prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</hi> before the green-room<lb>
mirror on the first night of &ldquo;The Demon's Daughter,<lb>
or The Castle of the Sun!! The most Magnificent<lb>
Spectacle ever produced upon the American Stage!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie looked, and saw a warlike figure with glittering<lb>
helmet, shield and lance, streaming hair and savage<lb>
cloak. She liked the picture, for there was much of<lb>
the heroic spirit in the girl, and even this poor counterfeit<lb>
pleased her eye and filled her fancy with<lb>
martial memories of Joan of Arc, Zenobia, and Britomarte.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to!&rdquo; cried Lucy, who affected theatrical modes<lb>
of speech. &ldquo;Don't admire yourself any longer, but tie<lb>
up your sandals and come on. Be sure you rush down<lb>
the instant I cry, `Demon, I defy thee!' Don't break<lb>

but come <hi rend="italics">with effect,</hi> for I want that scene to make a<lb>
hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princess Caremfil swept away, and the Amazonian<lb>
queen climbed to her perch among the painted mountains,<lb>
where her troop already sat like a flock of pigeons<lb>
shining in the sun. The gilded breast-plate rose and<lb>
fell with the quick beating of her heart, the spear shook<lb>
with the trembling of her hand, her lips were dry, her<lb>
head dizzy, and more than once, as she waited for her<lb>
cue, she was sorely tempted to run away and take the<lb>
consequences.</p>
<p>But the thought of Lucy's good-will and confidence<lb>
kept her, and when the cry came she answered with a<lb>
<pb n="043">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-054">

<figdesc>Page 043.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
ringing shout, rushed down the ten-foot precipice, and<lb>
charged upon the foe with an energy that inspired her<lb>
followers, and quite satisfied the princess struggling in<lb>
the demon's grasp.</p>
<p>With clashing of arms and shrill war-cries the rescuers<lb>
of innocence assailed the sooty fiends who fell before<lb>
their unscientific blows with a rapidity which inspired<lb>
in the minds of beholders a suspicion that the goblins'<lb>
own voluminous tails tripped them up and gallantry<lb>
kept them prostrate. As the last groan expired, the<lb>
last agonized squirm subsided, the conquerors performed<lb>
the intricate dance with which it appears the<lb>
Amazons were wont to celebrate their victories. Then<lb>
the scene closed with a glare of red light and a &ldquo;grand<lb>
tableau&rdquo; of the martial queen standing in a bower of<lb>
lances, the rescued princess gracefully fainting in her<lb>
arms, and the vanquished demon scowling fiercely<lb>
under her foot, while four-and-twenty dishevelled damsels<lb>
sang a song of exultation, to the barbaric music of<lb>
a tattoo on their shields.</p>
<p>All went well that night, and when at last the girls<lb>
doffed crown and helmet, they confided to one another<lb>
the firm opinion that the success of the piece was in a<lb>
great measure owing to their talent, their exertions,<lb>
and went gaily home predicting for themselves careers<lb>
as brilliant as those of Siddons and Rachel.</p>
<p>It would be a pleasant task to paint the vicissitudes<lb>
and victories of a successful actress; but Christie was<lb>
no dramatic genius born to shine before the world and<lb>
leave a name behind her. She had no talent except<lb>
that which may be developed in any girl possessing<lb>
the lively fancy, sympathetic nature, and ambitious<lb>
<pb n="044">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-055">

<figdesc>Page 044.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
spirit which make such girls naturally dramatic. This<lb>
was to be only one of many experiences which were to<lb>
show her her own weakness and strength, and through<lb>
effort, pain, and disappointment fit her to play a nobler<lb>
part on a wider stage.</p>
<p>For a few weeks Christie's illusions lasted; then she<lb>
discovered that the new life was nearly as humdrum as<lb>
the old, that her companions were ordinary men and<lb>
women, and her bright hopes were growing as dim as<lb>
her tarnished shield. She grew unutterably weary of<lb>
&ldquo;The Castle of the Sun,&rdquo; and found the &ldquo;Demon's<lb>
Daughter&rdquo; an unmitigated bore. She was not tired of<lb>
the profession, only dissatisfied with the place she held<lb>
in it, and eager to attempt a part that gave some scope<lb>
for power and passion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Black wisely reminded her that she must learn<lb>
to use her wings before she tried to fly, and comforted<lb>
her with stories of celebrities who had begun as she<lb>
was beginning, yet who had suddenly burst from their<lb>
grub-like obscurity to adorn the world as splendid<lb>
butterflies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll stand by you, Kit; so keep up your courage,<lb>
and do your best. Be clever to every one in general,<lb>
old Sharp in particular, and when a chance comes, have<lb>
your wits about you and grab it. That's the way to<lb>
get on,&rdquo; said Lucy, as sagely as if she had been a star<lb>
for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had beauty I should stand a better chance,&rdquo;<lb>
sighed Christie, surveying herself with great disfavor,<lb>
quite unconscious that to a cultivated eye the soul of<lb>
beauty was often visible in that face of hers, with its<lb>
intelligent eyes, sensitive mouth, and fine lines about<lb>
<pb n="045">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-056">

<figdesc>Page 045.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the forehead, making it a far more significant and<lb>
attractive countenance than that of her friend, possessing<lb>
only piquant prettiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, child; you 've got a lovely figure, and<lb>
an actress's best feature, &mdash; fine eyes and eyebrows. I<lb>
heard old Kent say so, and he 's a judge. So make the<lb>
best of what you 've got, as I do,&rdquo; answered Lucy,<lb>
glancing at her own comely little person with an air of<lb>
perfect resignation.</p>
<p>Charistie laughed at the adviser, but wisely took the<lb>
advice, and, though she fretted in private, was cheerful<lb>
and alert in public. Always modest, attentive, and<lb>
obliging, she soon became a favorite with her mates,<lb>
and, thanks to Lucy's good offices with Mr. Sharp,<lb>
whose favorite she was, Christie got promoted sooner<lb>
than she otherwise would have been.</p>
<p>A great Christmas spectacle was brought out the<lb>
next season, and Christie had a good part in it. When<lb>
that was over she thought there was no hope for her,<lb>
as the regular company was full and a different sort of<lb>
performance was to begin. But just then her chance<lb>
came, and she &ldquo;grabbed it.&rdquo; The first soubrette died<lb>
suddenly, and in the emergency Mr. Sharp offered the<lb>
place to Christie till he could fill it to his mind. Lucy<lb>
was second soubrette, and had hoped for this promotion;<lb>
but Lucy did not sing well. Christie had a good<lb>
voice, had taken lessons and much improved of late,<lb>
so she had the preference and resolved to stand the test<lb>
so well that this temporary elevation should become<lb>
permanent.</p>
<p>She did her best, and though many of the parts were<lb>
distasteful to her she got through them successfully,<lb>
<pb n="046">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-057">

<figdesc>Page 046.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
while now and then she had one which she thoroughly<lb>
enjoyed. Her Tilly Slowboy was a hit, and a proud<lb>
girl was Christie when Kent, the comedian, congratulated<lb>
her on it, and told her he had seldom seen it<lb>
better done.</p>
<p>To find favor in Kent's eyes was an honor indeed, for<lb>
he belonged to the old school, and rarely condescended<lb>
to praise modern actors. His own style was so admirable<lb>
that he was justly considered the first comedian<lb>
in the country, and was the pride and mainstay of the<lb>
old theatre where he had played for years. Of course<lb>
he possessed much influence in that little world, and<lb>
being a kindly man used it generously to help up any<lb>
young aspirant who seemed to him deserving.</p>
<p>He had observed Christie, attracted by her intelligent<lb>
face and modest manners, for in spite of her youth<lb>
there was a native refinement about her that made it<lb>
impossible for her to romp and flirt as some of her<lb>
mates did. But till she played Tilly he had not thought<lb>
she possessed any talent. That pleased him, and seeing<lb>
how mnch she valued his praise, and was flattered by<lb>
his notice, he gave her the wise but unpalatable advice<lb>
always offered young actors. Finding that she accepted<lb>
it, was willing to study hard, work faithfully, and wait<lb>
patiently, he predicted that in time she would make a<lb>
clever actress, never a great one.</p>
<p>Of course Christie thought he was mistaken, and<lb>
secretly resolved to prove him a false prophet by the<lb>
triumphs of her career. But she meekly bowed to his<lb>
opinion; this docility pleased him, and he took a paternal<lb>
sort of interest in her, which, coming from the powerful<lb>
favorite, did her good service with the higher<lb>
<pb n="047">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-058">

<figdesc>Page 047.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
powers, and helped her on more rapidly than years of<lb>
meritorious effort.</p>
<p>Toward the end of that second season several of<lb>
Dickens's dramatized novels were played, and Christie<lb>
earned fresh laurels. She loved those books, and<lb>
seemed by instinct to understand and personate the<lb>
humor and pathos of many of those grotesque creations.<lb>
Believing she had little beauty to sacrifice, she dressed<lb>
such parts to the life, and played them with a spirit<lb>
and ease that surprised those who had considered her<lb>
a dignified and rather dull young person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll tell you what it is, Sharp, that girl is going to<lb>
make a capital character actress. When her parts suit,<lb>
she forgets herself entirely and does admirably well.<lb>
Her Miggs was nearly the death of me to-night. She 's<lb>
got that one gift, and it 's a good one. You 'd better<lb>
give her a chance, for I think she 'll be a credit to the<lb>
old concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent said that, &mdash; Christie heard it, and flew to Lucy,<lb>
waving Miggs's cap for joy as she told the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Mr. Sharp say?&rdquo; asked Lucy, turning<lb>
round with her face half &ldquo;made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He merely said `Hum,' and smiled. Wasn't that a<lb>
good sign?&rdquo; said Christie, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can't say,&rdquo; and Lucy touched up her eyebrows as<lb>
if she took no interest in the affair.</p>
<p>Christie's face fell, and her heart sunk at the thought<lb>
of failure; but she kept up her spirits by working<lb>
harder than ever, and soon had her reward. Mr.<lb>
Sharp's &ldquo;Hum&rdquo; did mean yes, and the next season she<lb>
was regularly engaged, with a salary of thirty dollars<lb>
a week.</p>
<pb n="048">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-059">

<figdesc>Page 048.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>It was a grand step, and knowing that she owed it to<lb>
Kent, Christie did her utmost to show that she deserved<lb>
his good opinion. New trials and temptations beset<lb>
her now, but hard work and an innocent nature kept<lb>
her safe and busy. Obstacles only spurred her on to<lb>
redoubled exertion, and whether she did well or ill, was<lb>
praised or blamed, she found a never-failing excitement<lb>
in her attempts to reach the standard of perfection she<lb>
had set up for herself. Kent did not regret his patronage.<lb>
Mr. Sharp was satisfied with the success of the<lb>
experiment, and Christie soon became a favorite in a<lb>
small way, because behind the actress the public always<lb>
saw a woman who never &ldquo;forgot the modesty of<lb>
nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as she grew prosperous in outward things, Christie<lb>
found herself burdened with a private cross that<lb>
tried her very much. Lucy was no longer her friend;<lb>
something had come between them, and a steadily<lb>
increasing coldness took the place of the confidence<lb>
and affection which had once existed. Lucy was jealous<lb>
for Christie had passed her in the race. She knew<lb>
she could not fill the place Christie had gained by<lb>
favor, and now held by her own exertions, still she was<lb>
bitterly envious, though ashamed to own it.</p>
<p>Christie tried to be just and gentle, to prove her<lb>
gratitude to her first friend, and to show that her heart<lb>
was unchanged. But she failed to win Lucy back and<lb>
felt herself injured by such unjust resentment. Mrs.<lb>
Black took her daughter's part, and though they preserved<lb>
the peace outwardly the old friendliness was<lb>
quite gone.</p>
<p>Hoping to forget this trouble in excitement Christie<lb>
<pb n="049">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-060">

<figdesc>Page 049.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="3 D">
gave herself entirely to her profession, finding in it a<lb>
satisfaction which for a time consoled her.</p>
<p>But gradually she underwent the sorrowful change<lb>
which comes to strong natures when they wrong themselves<lb>
through ignorance or wilfulness.</p>
<p>Pride and native integrity kept her from the worst<lb>
temptations of such a life, but to the lesser ones she<lb>
yielded, growing selfish, frivolous, and vain, &mdash; intent on<lb>
her own advancement, and careless by what means she<lb>
reached it. She had no thought now beyond her art,<lb>
no desire beyond the commendation of those whose<lb>
opinion was serviceable, no care for any one but herself.<lb>
</p>
<p>Her love of admiration grew by what it fed on, till<lb>
the sound of applause became the sweetest music to<lb>
her ear. She rose with this hope, lay down with this<lb>
satisfaction, and month after month passed in this feverish<lb>
life, with no wish to change it, but a growing appetite<lb>
for its unsatisfactory delights, an ever-increasing<lb>
forgetfulness of any higher aspiration than dramatic<lb>
fame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me joy, Lucy, I 'm to have a benefit next<lb>
week! Everybody else has had one, and I 've played<lb>
for them all, so no one seemed to begrudge me my turn<lb>
when dear old Kent proposed it,&rdquo; said Christie, coming<lb>
in one night still flushed and excited with the good<lb>
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall you have?&rdquo; asked Lucy, trying to look<lb>
pleased, and failing decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Masks and Faces.' I 've always wanted to play Peg.<lb>
and it has good parts for you and Kent, and St. George.<lb>
<pb n="050">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-061">

<figdesc>Page 050.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
I chose it for that reason, for I shall need all the help<lb>
I can get to pull me through, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile vanished entirely at this speech, and Christie<lb>
was suddenly seized with a suspicion that Lucy was<lb>
not only jealous of her as an actress, but as a woman.<lb>
St. George was a comely young actor who usually<lb>
played lovers' parts with Christie, and played them<lb>
very well, too, being possessed of much talent, and a<lb>
gentleman. They had never thought of falling in love<lb>
with each other, though St. George wooed and won<lb>
Christie night after night in vaudeville and farce. But<lb>
it was very easy to imagine that so much mock passion<lb>
had a basis of truth, and Lucy evidently tormented<lb>
herself with this belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you choose Juliet: St. George would<lb>
do Romeo so well?&rdquo; said Lucy, with a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is beyond me. Kent says Shakespeare<lb>
will never be my line, and I believe him. I should<lb>
think you 'd be satisfied with `Masks and Faces,' for you<lb>
know Mabel gets her husband safely back in the end,&rdquo;<lb>
answered Christie, watching the effect of her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I wanted the man! No, thank you, other<lb>
people's leavings won't suit me,&rdquo; cried Lucy, tossing<lb>
her head, though her face belied her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even though he has `heavenly eyes,' `distracting<lb>
legs,' and `a melting voice?&rdquo;' asked Christie maliciously,<lb>
quoting Lucy's own rapturous speeches when<lb>
the new actor came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, girls, don't quarrel. I won't 'ave it in<lb>
me room. Lucy's tired to death, and it 's not nice of<lb>
you, Kitty, to come and crow over her this way,&rdquo; said<lb>
<pb n="051">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-062">

<figdesc>Page 051.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Mamma Black, coming to the rescue, for Lucy was in<lb>
tears, and Christie looking dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's impossible to please you, so I'll say good-night,&rdquo;<lb>
and Christie went to her room with resentment burning<lb>
hotly in her heart.</p>
<p>As she crossed the chamber her eye fell on her own<lb>
figure reflected in the long glass, and with a sudden<lb>
impulse she turned up the gas, wiped the rouge from<lb>
her cheeks, pushed back her hair, and studied her own<lb>
face intently for several moments. It was pale and<lb>
jaded now, and all its freshness seemed gone; hard<lb>
lines had come about the mouth, a feverish disquiet<lb>
filled the eyes, and on the forehead seemed to lie the<lb>
shadow of a discontent that saddened the whole face.<lb>
If one could believe the testimony of that countenance<lb>
things were not going well with Christie, and she<lb>
owned it with a regretful sigh, as she asked herself,<lb>
&ldquo;Am I what I hoped I should be?  No, and it is my<lb>
fault. If three years of this life have made me this,<lb>
what shall I be in ten? A fine actress perhaps, but<lb>
how good a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With gloomy eyes fixed on her altered face she stood<lb>
a moment struggling with herself. Then the hard look<lb>
returned, and she spoke out defiantly, as if in answer<lb>
to some warning voice within herself. &ldquo;No one cares<lb>
what I am, so why care myself? Why not go on and<lb>
get as much fame as I can? Success gives me power<lb>
it if cannot give me happiness, and I must have some<lb>
reward for my hard work. Yes! a gay life and a short<lb>
one, then out with the lights and down with the<lb>
curtain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of her reckless words Christie sobbed<lb>
<pb n="052">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-063">

<figdesc>Page 052.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
herself to sleep that night like a child who knows it is<lb>
astray, yet cannot see the right path or hear its mother's<lb>
voice calling it home.</p>
<p>On the night of the benefit, Lucy was in a most exasperating<lb>
mood, Christie in a very indignant one, and<lb>
as they entered their dressing-room they looked as if<lb>
they might have played the Rival Queens with great<lb>
effect. Lucy offered no help and Christie asked none,<lb>
but putting her vexation resolutely out of sight fixed<lb>
her mind on the task before her.</p>
<p>As the pleasant stir began all about her, actress-like,<lb>
she felt her spirits rise, her courage increase with every<lb>
curl she fastened up, every gay garment she put on,<lb>
and soon smiled approvingly at herself, for excitement<lb>
lent her cheeks a better color than rouge, her eyes<lb>
shone with satisfaction, and her heart beat high with<lb>
the resolve to make a hit or die.</p>
<p>Christie needed encouragement that night, and found<lb>
it in the hearty welcome that greeted her, and the full<lb>
house, which proved how kind a regard was entertained<lb>
for her by many who knew her only by a fictitious<lb>
name. She felt this deeply, and it helped her much,<lb>
for she was vexed with many trials those before the<lb>
footlights knew nothing of.</p>
<p>The other players were full of kindly interest in her<lb>
success, but Lucy took a naughty satisfaction in harassing<lb>
her by all the small slights and unanswerable<lb>
provocations which one actress has it in her power to<lb>
inflict upon another.</p>
<p>Christie was fretted almost beyond endurance, and<lb>
retaliated by an ominous frown when her position<lb>
allowed, threatening asides when a moment's by-play<lb>
<pb n="053">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-064">

<figdesc>Page 053.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
favored their delivery, and angry protests whenever<lb>
she met Lucy off the stage.</p>
<p>But in spite of all annoyances she had never played<lb>
better in her life. She liked the part, and acted the<lb>
warm-hearted, quick-witted, sharp-tongued Peg with<lb>
a spirit and grace that surprised even those who knew<lb>
her best. Especially good was she in the scenes with<lb>
Triplet, for Kent played the part admirably, and cheered<lb>
her on with many an encouraging look and word.<lb>
Anxious to do honor to her patron and friend she<lb>
threw her whole heart into the work; in the scene<lb>
where she comes like a good angel to the home of the<lb>
poor play-wright, she brought tears to the eyes of her<lb>
audience; and when at her command Triplet strikes<lb>
up a jig to amuse the children she &ldquo;covered the<lb>
buckle&rdquo; in gallant style, dancing with all the frolicsome<lb>
<hi rend="italics">abandon</hi> of the Irish orange-girl who for a<lb>
moment forgot her grandeur and her grief.</p>
<p>That scene was her best, for it is full of those touches<lb>
of nature that need very little art to make them effective;<lb>
and when a great bouquet fell with a thump at<lb>
Christie's feet, as she paused to bow her thanks for an<lb>
encore, she felt that she had reached the height of<lb>
earthly bliss.</p>
<p>In the studio scene Lucy seemed suddenly gifted<lb>
with unsuspected skill; for when Mabel kneels to the<lb>
picture, praying her rival to give her back her husband's<lb>
heart, Christie was amazed to see real tears roll down<lb>
Lucy's cheeks, and to hear real love and longing thrill<lb>
her trembling words with sudden power and passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not acting. She does love St. George, and<lb>
thinks I mean to keep him from her. Poor dear! I 'll<lb>

</eaffig>
tell her all about it to-night, and set her heart at rest,&rdquo;<lb>
thought Christie; and when Peg left the frame, her<lb>
face expressed the genuine pity that she felt, and her<lb>
voice was beautifully tender as she promised to restore<lb>
the stolen treasure.</p>
<p>Lucy felt comforted without knowing why, and the<lb>
piece went smoothly on to its last scene. Peg was<lb>
just relinquishing the repentant husband to his forgiving<lb>
wife with those brave words of hers, when a rending<lb>
sound above their heads made all look up and start<lb>
back; all but Lucy, who stood bewildered. Christie's<lb>
quick eye saw the impending danger, and with a sudden<lb>
spring she caught her friend from it. It was only<lb>
a second's work, but it cost her much; for in the act,<lb>
down crashed one of the mechanical contrivances used<lb>
in a late spectacle, and in its fall stretched Christie<lb>
stunned and senseless on the stage.</p>
<p>A swift uprising filled the house with tumult; a<lb>
crowd of actors hurried forward, and the panic-stricken<lb>
audience caught glimpses of poor Peg lying mute and<lb>
pallid in Mabel's arms, while Vane wrung his hands,<lb>
and Triplet audibly demanded, &ldquo;Why the devil somebody<lb>
didn't go for a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a brilliant view of Mount Parnassus, with<lb>
Apollo and the Nine Muses in full blast, shut the scene<lb>
from sight, and soon Mr. Sharp appeared to ask their<lb>
patience till the after-piece was ready, for Miss Douglas<lb>
was too much injured to appear again. And with an<lb>
unwonted expression of feeling, the little man alluded<lb>
to &ldquo;the generous act which perhaps had changed the<lb>
comedy to a tragedy and robbed the beneficiary of her<lb>
well-earned reward at their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="055">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-066">

<figdesc>Page 055.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>All had seen the impulsive spring toward, not from,<lb>
the danger, and this unpremeditated action won heartier<lb>
applause than Christie ever had received for her<lb>
best rendering of more heroic deeds.</p>
<p>But she did not hear the cordial round they gave<lb>
her. She had said she would &ldquo;make a hit or die;&rdquo;<lb>
and just then it seemed as if she had done both, for<lb>
she was deaf and blind to the admiration and the<lb>
sympathy bestowed upon her as the curtain fell on the<lb>
first, last benefit she ever was to have.</p>

</p>
<p>DURING the next few weeks Christie learned the<lb>
worth of many things which she had valued very<lb>
lightly until then. Health became a boon too precious<lb>
to be trifled with; life assumed a deeper significance<lb>
when death's shadow fell upon its light, and she discovered<lb>
that dependence might be made endurable by<lb>
the sympathy of unsuspected friends.</p>
<p>Lucy waited upon her with a remorseful devotion<lb>
<pb n="057">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-068">

<figdesc>Page 057.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="3*">
which touched her very much and won entire forgiveness<lb>
for the past, long before it was repentantly implored.<lb>
All her comrades came with offers of help and<lb>
affectionate regrets. Several whom she had most disliked<lb>
now earned her gratitude by the kindly thoughtfulness<lb>
which filled her sick-room with fruit and flowers,<lb>
supplied carriages for the convalescent, and paid her<lb>
doctor's bill without her knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus Christie learned, like many another needy<lb>
member of the gay profession, that though often extravagant<lb>
and jovial in their way of life, these men and<lb>
women give as freely as they spend, wear warm, true<lb>
hearts under their motley, and make misfortune only<lb>
another link in the bond of good-fellowship which<lb>
binds them loyally together.</p>
<p>Slowly Christie gathered her energies after weeks of<lb>
suffering, and took up her life again, grateful for the<lb>
gift, and anxious to be more worthy of it. Looking<lb>
back upon the past she felt that she had made a mistake<lb>
and lost more than she had gained in those three<lb>
years. Others might lead that life of alternate excitement<lb>
and hard work unharmed, but she could not.<lb>
The very ardor and insight which gave power to the<lb>
actress made that mimic life unsatisfactory to the<lb>
woman, for hers was an earnest nature that took fast<lb>
hold of whatever task she gave herself to do, and lived<lb>
in it heartily while duty made it right, or novelty lent<lb>
it charms. But when she saw the error of a step, the<lb>
emptiness of a belief, with a like earnestness she tried to<lb>
retrieve the one and to replace the other with a better<lb>
substitute.</p>
<p>In the silence of wakeful nights and the solitude of<lb>
<pb n="058">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-069">

<figdesc>Page 058.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
quiet days, she took counsel with her better self, condemned<lb>
the reckless spirit which had possessed her,<lb>
and came at last to the decision which conscience<lb>
prompted and much thought confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stage is not the place for me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I<lb>
have no genius to glorify the drudgery, keep me from<lb>
temptation, and repay me for any sacrifice I make.<lb>
Other women can lead this life safely and happily: I<lb>
cannot, and I must not go back to it, because, with all<lb>
my past experience, and in spite of all my present good<lb>
resolutions, I should do no better, and I might do worse.<lb>
I 'm not wise enough to keep steady there; I must<lb>
return to the old ways, dull but safe, and plod along<lb>
till I find my real place and work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great was the surprise of Lucy and her mother when<lb>
Christie told her resolution, adding, in a whisper, to the<lb>
girl, &ldquo;I leave the field clear for you, dear, and will<lb>
dance at your wedding with all my heart when St.<lb>
George asks you to play the `Honeymoon' with him,<lb>
as I 'm sure he will before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many entreaties from friends, as well as secret longings,<lb>
tried and tempted Christie sorely, but she withstood<lb>
them all, carried her point, and renounced the<lb>
profession she could not follow without self-injury and<lb>
self-reproach. The season was nearly over when she<lb>
was well enough to take her place again, but she<lb>
refused to return, relinquished her salary, sold her wardrobe,<lb>
and never crossed the threshold of the theatre<lb>
after she had said good-bye.</p>
<p>Then she asked, &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; and was speedily<lb>
answered. An advertisement for a governess met her<lb>
eye, which seemed to combine the two things she<lb>
<pb n="059">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-070">

<figdesc>Page 059.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
most needed just then, &mdash; employment and change of<lb>
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you don't mention that you 've been an actress<lb>
or it will be all up with you, me dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Black,<lb>
as Christie prepared to investigate the matter, for since<lb>
her last effort in that line she had increased her knowledge<lb>
of music, and learned French enough to venture<lb>
teaching it to very young pupils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd rather tell in the beginning, for if you keep any<lb>
thing back it 's sure to pop out when you least expect or<lb>
want it. I don't believe these people will care as long<lb>
as I 'm respectable and teach well,&rdquo; returned Christie,<lb>
wishing she looked stronger and rosier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You 'll be sorry if you do tell,&rdquo; warned Mrs. Black,<lb>
who knew the ways of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be sorry if I don't,&rdquo; laughed Christie, and<lb>
so she was, in the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L. N. Saltonstall&rdquo; was the name on the door, and<lb>
L. N. Saltonstall's servant was so leisurely about<lb>
answering Christie's meek solo on the bell, that she had<lb>
time to pull out her bonnet-strings half-a-dozen times<lb>
before a very black man in a very white jacket condescended<lb>
to conduct her to his mistress.</p>
<p>A frail, tea-colored lady appeared, displaying such<lb>
a small proportion of woman to such a large proportion<lb>
of purple and fine linen, that she looked as if<lb>
she was literally as well as figuratively &ldquo;dressed to<lb>
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie went to the point in a business-like manner<lb>
that seemed to suit Mrs. Saltonstall, because it saved<lb>
so much trouble, and she replied, with a languid affability:<lb>
</p>
<pb n="060">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-071">

<figdesc>Page 060.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish some one to teach the children a little, for<lb>
they are getting too old to be left entirely to nurse. I<lb>
am anxious to get to the sea-shore as soon as possible,<lb>
for they have been poorly all winter, and my own<lb>
health has suffered. Do you feel inclined to try the<lb>
place? And what compensation do you require?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie had but a vague idea of what wages were<lb>
usually paid to nursery governesses, and hesitatingly<lb>
named a sum which seemed reasonable to her, but was<lb>
so much less than any other applicant had asked, that<lb>
Mrs. Saltonstall began to think she could not do better<lb>
than secure this cheap young person, who looked firm<lb>
enough to manage her rebellious son and heir, and<lb>
well-bred enough to begin the education of a little fine<lb>
lady. Her winter had been an extravagant one, and<lb>
she could economize in the governess better perhaps<lb>
than elsewhere; so she decided to try Christie, and get<lb>
out of town at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your terms are quite satisfactory, Miss Devon, and<lb>
if my brother approves, I think we will consider the<lb>
matter settled. Perhaps you would like to see the<lb>
children? They are little darlings, and you will soon<lb>
be fond of them, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bell was rung, an order given, and presently<lb>
appeared an eight-year old boy, so excessively Scotch<lb>
in his costume that he looked like an animated checker-board;<lb>
and a little girl, who presented the appearance<lb>
of a miniature opera-dancer staggering under the<lb>
weight of an immense sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and speak prettily to Miss Devon, my pets, for<lb>
she is coming to play with you, and you must mind<lb>
what she says,&rdquo; commanded mamma.</p>
<pb n="061">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-072">

<figdesc>Page 061.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The pale, fretful-looking little pair went solemnly to<lb>
Christie's knee, and stood there staring at her with a<lb>
dull composure that quite daunted her, it was so sadly<lb>
unchildlike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name, dear?&rdquo; she asked, laying her<lb>
hand on the young lady's head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villamena Temmatina Taltentall. You mustn't<lb>
touch my hair; it 's just turled,&rdquo; was the somewhat<lb>
embarrassing reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine's Louy 'Poleon Thaltensthall, like papa's,&rdquo;<lb>
volunteered the other young person, and Christie privately<lb>
wondered if the possession of names nearly as<lb>
long as themselves was not a burden to the poor<lb>
dears.</p>
<p>Feeling that she must say something, she asked, in<lb>
her most persuasive tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to have me come and teach you<lb>
some nice lessons out of your little books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had proposed corporal punishment on the spot<lb>
it could not have caused greater dismay. Wilhelmina<lb>
cast herself upon the floor passionately, declaring that<lb>
she &ldquo;touldn't tuddy,&rdquo; and Saltonstall, Jr., retreated<lb>
precipitately to the door, and from that refuge defied<lb>
the whole race of governesses and &ldquo;nasty lessons&rdquo;<lb>
jointly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, run away to Justine. They are sadly out<lb>
of sorts, and quite pining for sea-air,&rdquo; said mamma,<lb>
with both hands at her ears, for the war-cries of her<lb>
darlings were piercing as they departed, proclaiming<lb>
their wrongs while swarming up stairs, with a skirmish<lb>
on each landing.</p>
<p>With a few more words Christie took leave, and<lb>
<pb n="062">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-073">

<figdesc>Page 062.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
scandalized the sable retainer by smiling all through<lb>
the hall, and laughing audibly as the door closed. The<lb>
contrast of the plaid boy and beruffled girl's irritability<lb>
with their mother's languid affectation, and her own<lb>
unfortunate efforts, was too much for her. In the<lb>
middle of her merriment she paused suddenly, saying<lb>
to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never told about my acting. I must go back<lb>
and have it settled.&rdquo; She retraced a few steps, then<lb>
turned and went on again, thinking, &ldquo;No; for once I'll<lb>
be guided by other people's advice, and let well<lb>
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A note arrived soon after, bidding Miss Devon consider<lb>
herself engaged, and desiring her to join the<lb>
family at the boat on Monday next.</p>
<p>At the appointed time Christie was on board, and<lb>
looked about for her party. Mrs. Saltonstall appeared<lb>
in the distance with her family about her, and Christie<lb>
took a survey before reporting herself. Madame looked<lb>
more like a fashion-plate than ever, in a mass of green<lb>
flounces, and an impressive bonnet flushed with poppies<lb>
and bristling with wheat-ears. Beside her sat a gentleman,<lb>
rapt in a newspaper, of course, for to an American<lb>
man life is a burden till the daily news have been absorbed.<lb>
Mrs. Saltonstall's brother was the possessor<lb>
of a handsome eye without softness, thin lips without<lb>
benevolence, but plenty of will; a face and figure<lb>
which some thirty-five years of ease and pleasure had<lb>
done their best to polish and spoil, and a costume<lb>
without flaw, from his aristocratic boots to the summer<lb>
hat on his head.</p>
<p>The little boy more checkered and the little girl<lb>

</eaffig>
more operatic than before, sat on stools eating <hi rend="italics">bonbons,</hi><lb>
while a French maid and the African footman hovered<lb>
in the background.</p>
<p>Feeling very much like a meek gray moth among<lb>
a flock of butterflies, Christie modestly presented herself.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Madame with a nod, which,<lb>
<pb n="064">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-075">

<figdesc>Page 064.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
slight as it was, caused a great commotion among the<lb>
poppies and the wheat; &ldquo;I began to be anxious about<lb>
you. Miss Devon, my brother, Mr. Fletcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman bowed, and as Christie sat down he<lb>
got up, saying, as he sauntered away with a bored<lb>
expression:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have the paper, Charlotte? There's<lb>
nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Saltonstall seemed going to sleep and she<lb>
felt delicate about addressing the irritable infants<lb>
in public, Christie amused herself by watching Mr.<lb>
Fletcher as he roamed listlessly about, and deciding,<lb>
in her usual rash way, that she did not like him because<lb>
he looked both lazy and cross, and <hi rend="italics">ennui</hi> was evidently<lb>
his bosom friend. Soon, however, she forgot every<lb>
thing but the shimmer of the sunshine on the sea, the<lb>
fresh wind that brought color to her pale cheeks, and<lb>
the happy thoughts that left a smile upon her lips.<lb>
Then Mr. Fletcher put up his glass and stared at her,<lb>
shook his head, and said, as he lit a cigar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little wretch, what a time she will have of it<lb>
between Charlotte and the brats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Christie needed no pity, and thought herself a<lb>
fortunate young woman when fairly established in her<lb>
corner of the luxurious apartments occupied by the<lb>
family. Her duties seemed light compared to those<lb>
she had left, her dreams were almost as bright as of<lb>
old, and the new life looked pleasant to her, for she was<lb>
one of those who could find little bits of happiness for<lb>
herself and enjoy them heartily in spite of loneliness<lb>
or neglect.</p>
<p>One of her amusements was studying her companions,<lb>
<pb n="065">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-076">

<figdesc>Page 065.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="E">
and for a time this occupied her, for Christie possessed<lb>
penetration and a feminine fancy for finding out people.</p>
<p>Mrs. Saltonstall's mission appeared to be the illustration<lb>
of each new fashion as it came, and she performed<lb>
it with a devotion worthy of a better cause.<lb>
If a color reigned supreme she flushed herself with<lb>
scarlet or faded into primrose, made herself pretty in<lb>
the bluest of blue gowns, or turned livid under a gooseberry<lb>
colored bonnet. Her hat-brims went up or down,<lb>
were preposterously wide or dwindled to an inch, as<lb>
the mode demanded. Her skirts were rampant with<lb>
sixteen frills; or picturesque with landscapes down each<lb>
side, and a Greek border or a plain hem. Her waists<lb>
were as pointed as those of Queen Bess or as short as<lb>
Diana's; and it was the opinion of those who knew<lb>
her that if the autocrat who ruled her life decreed the<lb>
wearing of black cats as well as of vegetables, bugs,<lb>
and birds, the blackest, glossiest Puss procurable for<lb>
money would have adorned her head in some way.</p>
<p>Her time was spent in dressing, driving, dining and<lb>
dancing; in skimming novels, and embroidering muslin;<lb>
going to church with a velvet prayer-book and a new<lb>
bonnet; and writing to her husband when she wanted<lb>
money, for she had a husband somewhere abroad,<lb>
who so happily combined business with pleasure that<lb>
he never found time to come home. Her children were<lb>
inconvenient blessings, but she loved them with the<lb>
love of a shallow heart, and took such good care of<lb>
their little bodies that there was none left for their little<lb>
souls. A few days' trial satisfied her as to Christie's<lb>
capabilities, and, relieved of that anxiety, she gave herself<lb>
up to her social duties, leaving the ocean and the<lb>
<pb n="066">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-077">

<figdesc>Page 066.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
governess to make the summer wholesome and agreeable<lb>
to &ldquo;the darlings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher, having tried all sorts of pleasure and<lb>
found that, like his newspaper, there was &ldquo;nothing in<lb>
it,&rdquo; was now paying the penalty for that unsatisfactory<lb>
knowledge. Ill health soured his temper and made his<lb>
life a burden to him. Having few resources within<lb>
himself to fall back upon, he was very dependent upon<lb>
other people, and other people were so busy amusing<lb>
themselves, they seemed to find little time or inclination<lb>
to amuse a man who had never troubled himself<lb>
about them. He was rich, but while his money could<lb>
hire a servant to supply each want, gratify each caprice,<lb>
it could not buy a tender, faithful friend to serve for<lb>
love, and ask no wages but his comfort.</p>
<p>He knew this, and felt the vain regret that inevitably<lb>
comes to those who waste life and learn the value of<lb>
good gifts by their loss. But he was not wise or brave<lb>
enough to bear his punishment manfully, and lay the<lb>
lesson honestly to heart. Fretful and imperious when<lb>
in pain, listless and selfish when at ease, his one aim in<lb>
life now was to kill time, and any thing that aided him<lb>
in this was most gratefully welcomed.</p>
<p>For a long while he took no more notice of Christie<lb>
than if she had been a shadow, seldom speaking beyond<lb>
the necessary saluations, and merely carrying his finger<lb>
to his hat-brim when he passed her on the beach with<lb>
the children. Her first dislike was softened by pity<lb>
when she found he was an invalid, but she troubled<lb>
herself very little about him, and made no romances<lb>
with him, for all her dreams were of younger, nobler<lb>
lovers.</p>
<pb n="067">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-078">

<figdesc>Page 067.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Busied with her own affairs, the days though monotonous<lb>
were not unhappy. She prospered in her work<lb>
and the children soon believed in her as devoutly as<lb>
young Turks in their Prophet. She devised amusements<lb>
for herself as well as for them; walked, bathed,<lb>
drove, and romped with the little people till her own<lb>
eyes shone like theirs, her cheek grew rosy, and her<lb>
thin figure rounded with the promise of vigorous health<lb>
again.</p>
<p>Christie was at her best that summer, physically<lb>
speaking, for sickness had refined her face, giving it<lb>
that indescribable expression which pain often leaves<lb>
upon a countenance as if in compensation for the bloom<lb>
it takes away. The frank eyes had a softer shadow in<lb>
their depths, the firm lips smiled less often, but when it<lb>
came the smile was the sweeter for the gravity that<lb>
went before, and in her voice there was a new undertone<lb>
of that subtle music, called sympathy, which steals<lb>
into the heart and nestles there.</p>
<p>She was unconscious of this gracious change, but<lb>
others saw and felt it, and to some a face bright with<lb>
health, intelligence, and modesty was more attractive<lb>
than mere beauty. Thanks to this and her quiet, cordial<lb>
manners, she found friends here and there to add charms<lb>
to that summer by the sea.</p>
<p>The dashing young men took no more notice of her<lb>
than if she had been a little gray peep on the sands;<lb>
not so much, for they shot peeps now and then, but a<lb>
governess was not worth bringing down. The fashionable<lb>
belles and beauties were not even aware of her<lb>
existence, being too entirely absorbed in their yearly<lb>
husband-hunt to think of any one but themselves and<lb>
<pb n="068">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-079">

<figdesc>Page 068.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
their prey. The dowagers had more interesting topics<lb>
to discuss, and found nothing in Christie's humble fortunes<lb>
worthy of a thought, for they liked their gossip<lb>
strong and highly flavored, like their tea.</p>
<p>But a kind-hearted girl or two found her out, several<lb>
lively old maids, as full of the romance of the past as<lb>
ancient novels, a bashful boy, three or four invalids,<lb>
and <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the children, for Christie had a motherly heart<lb>
and could find charms in the plainest, crossest baby that<lb>
ever squalled.</p>
<p>Of her old friends she saw nothing, as her theatrical<lb>
ones were off on their vacations, Hepsey had left her<lb>
place for one in another city, and Aunt Betsey seldom<lb>
wrote.</p>
<p>But one day a letter came, telling her that the dear<lb>
old lady would never write again, and Christie felt as<lb>
if her nearest and dearest friend was lost. She had<lb>
gone away to a quiet spot among the rocks to get over<lb>
her first grief alone, but found it very hard to cheek<lb>
her tears, as memory brought back the past, tenderly<lb>
recalling every kind act, every loving word, and familiar<lb>
scene. She seldom wept, but when any thing did unseal<lb>
the fountains that lay so deep, she cried with all her<lb>
heart, and felt the better for it.</p>
<p>With the letter crumpled in her hand, her head on<lb>
her knees, and her hat at her feet, she was sobbing like<lb>
a child, when steps startled her, and, looking up, she<lb>
saw Mr. Fletcher regarding her with an astonished<lb>
countenance from under his big sun umbrella.</p>
<p>Something in the flushed, wet face, with its tremulous<lb>
lips and great tears rolling down, seemed to touch<lb>
<pb n="069">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-080">

<figdesc>Page 069.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
even lazy Mr. Fletcher, for he furled his umbrella with<lb>
unusual rapidity, and came up, saying, anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Devon, what 's the matter? Are<lb>
you hurt? Has Mrs. S. been scolding? Or have the<lb>
children been too much for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; oh, no! it 's bad news from home,&rdquo; and Christie's<lb>
head went down again, for a kind word was more<lb>
than she could bear just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one ill, I fancy? I 'm sorry to hear it, but<lb>
you must hope for the best, you know,&rdquo; replied Mr.<lb>
Fletcher, really quite exerting himself to remember and<lb>
present this well-worn consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no hope; Aunt Betsey 's dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! that 's very sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher tried not to smile as Christie sobbed<lb>
out the old-fashioned name, but a minute afterward<lb>
there were actually tears in his eyes, for, as if won by<lb>
his sympathy, she poured out the homely little story of<lb>
Aunt Betsey's life and love, unconsciously pronouncing<lb>
the kind old lady's best epitaph in the unaffected grief<lb>
that made her broken words so eloquent.</p>
<p>For a minute Mr. Fletcher forgot himself, and felt as<lb>
he remembered feeling long ago, when a warm-hearted<lb>
boy, he had comforted his little sister for a lost kitten<lb>
or a broken doll. It was a new sensation, therefore<lb>
interesting and agreeable while it lasted, and when<lb>
it vanished, which it speedily did, he sighed, then<lb>
shrugged his shoulders and wished &ldquo;the girl would<lb>
stop crying like a water-spout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's hard, but we all have to bear it, you know;<lb>
and sometimes I fancy if half the pity we give the<lb>
dead, who don't need it, was given to the living, who<lb>
<pb n="070">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-081">

<figdesc>Page 070.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
do, they 'd bear their troubles more comfortably. I<lb>
know <hi rend="italics">I</hi> should,&rdquo; added Mr. Fletcher, returning to his<lb>
own afflictions, and vaguely wondering if any one<lb>
would cry like that when he departed this life.</p>
<p>Christie minded little what he said, for his voice was<lb>
pitiful and it comforted her. She dried her tears, put<lb>
back her hair, and thanked him with a grateful smile,<lb>
which gave him another pleasant sensation; for, though<lb>
young ladies showered smiles upon him with midsummer<lb>
radiance, they seemed cool and pale beside the<lb>
sweet sincerity of this one given by a girl whose eyes<lb>
were red with tender tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's right, cheer up, take a little run on the<lb>
beach, and forget all about it,&rdquo; he said, with a heartiness<lb>
that surprised himself as much as it did Christie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, thank you. Please don't speak of this; I 'm<lb>
used to bearing my troubles alone, and time will help<lb>
me to do it cheerfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's brave! If I can do any thing, let me know;<lb>
I shall be most happy.&rdquo; And Mr. Fletcher evidently<lb>
meant what he said.</p>
<p>Christie gave him another grateful &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;<lb>
then picked up her hat and went away along the sands<lb>
to try his prescription; while Mr. Fletcher walked the<lb>
other way, so rapt in thought that he forgot to put<lb>
up his umbrella till the end of his aristocratic nose was<lb>
burnt a deep red.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of it; for when Mr. Fletcher<lb>
found a new amusement, he usually pursued it regardless<lb>
of consequences. Christie took his pity for what<lb>
it was worth, and thought no more of that little interview,<lb>
for her heart was very heavy. But he<lb>
<pb n="071">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-082">

<figdesc>Page 071.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
remembered it, and, when they met on the beach next day,<lb>
wondered how the governess would behave. She was<lb>
reading as she walked, and, with a mute acknowledgment<lb>
of his nod, tranquilly turned a page and read on<lb>
without a pause, a smile, or change of color.</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher laughed as he strolled away; but Christie<lb>
was all the more amusing for her want of coquetry,<lb>
and soon after he tried her again. The great hotel<lb>
was all astir one evening with bustle, light, and music;<lb>
for the young people had a hop, as an appropriate<lb>
entertainment for a melting July night. With no taste<lb>
for such folly, even if health had not forbidden it, Mr.<lb>
Fletcher lounged about the piazzas, tantalizing the fair<lb>
fowlers who spread their nets for him, and goading<lb>
sundry desperate spinsters to despair by his erratic<lb>
movements. Coming to a quiet nook, where a long<lb>
window gave a fine view of the brilliant scene, he<lb>
found Christie leaning in, with a bright, wistful face,<lb>
while her hand kept time to the enchanting music of a<lb>
waltz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisely watching the lunatics, instead of joining in<lb>
their antics,&rdquo; he said, sitting down with a sigh.</p>
<p>Christie looked around and answered, with the wistful<lb>
look still in her eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm very fond of that sort of insanity; but there<lb>
is no place for me in Bedlam at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay I can find you one, if you care to try it.<lb>
I don't indulge myself.&rdquo; And Mr. Fletcher's eye went<lb>
from the rose in Christie's brown hair to the silvery<lb>
folds of her best gown, put on merely for the pleasure<lb>
of wearing it because every one else was in festival<lb>
array.</p>
<pb n="072">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-083">

<figdesc>Page 072.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No, thank you. Governesses<lb>
are very kindly treated in America; but ball-rooms<lb>
like that are not for them. I enjoy looking on, fortunately;<lb>
so I have my share of fun after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan't get any complaints out of her. Plucky<lb>
little soul! I rather like that,&rdquo; said Mr. Fletcher to<lb>
himself; and, finding his seat comfortable, the corner<lb>
cool, and his companion pleasant to look at, with the<lb>
moonlight doing its best for her, he went on talking for<lb>
his own satisfaction.</p>
<p>Christie would rather have been left in peace; but<lb>
fancying that he did it out of kindness to her, and that<lb>
she had done him injustice before, she was grateful<lb>
now, and exerted herself to seem so; in which endeavor<lb>
she succeeded so well that Mr. Fletcher proved he<lb>
could be a very agreeable companion when he chose.<lb>
He talked well; and Christie was a good listener. Soon<lb>
interest conquered her reserve, and she ventured to<lb>
ask a question, make a criticism, or express an opinion<lb>
in her own simple way. Unconsciously she piqued the<lb>
curiosity of the man; for, though he knew many lovely,<lb>
wise, and witty women, he had never chanced to meet<lb>
with one like this before; and novelty was the desire<lb>
of his life. Of course he did not find moonlight, music,<lb>
and agreeable chat as delightful as she did; but there<lb>
<hi rend="italics">was</hi> something animating in the fresh face opposite,<lb>
something flattering in the eager interest she showed,<lb>
and something most attractive in the glimpses unconsciously<lb>
given him of a nature genuine in its womanly<lb>
sincerity and strength. Something about this girl<lb>
seemed to appeal to the old self, so long neglected that<lb>
he thought it dead. He could not analyze the feeling,<lb>
<pb n="073">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-084">

<figdesc>Page 073.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="4">
but was conscious of a desire to seem better than he<lb>
was as he looked into those honest eyes; to talk well,<lb>
that he might bring that frank smile to the lips that<lb>
grew either sad or scornful when he tried worldly gossip<lb>
or bitter satire; and to prove himself a man under<lb>
all the elegance and polish of the gentleman.</p>
<p>He was discovering then, what Christie learned<lb>
when her turn came, that fine natures seldom fail to<lb>
draw out the finer traits of those who approach them,<lb>
as the little witch-hazel wand, even in the hand of a<lb>
child, detects and points to hidden springs in unsuspected<lb>
spots. Women often possess this gift, and when<lb>
used worthily find it as powerful as beauty; for, if less<lb>
alluring, it is more lasting and more helpful, since it<lb>
appeals, not to the senses, but the souls of men.</p>
<p>Christie was one of these; and in proportion as her<lb>
own nature was sound and sweet so was its power as a<lb>
touchstone for the genuineness of others. It was this<lb>
unconscious gift that made her wonder at the unexpected<lb>
kindness she found in Mr. Fletcher, and this<lb>
which made him, for an hour or two at least, heartily<lb>
wish he could live his life over again and do it<lb>
better.</p>
<p>After that evening Mr. Fletcher spoke to Christie<lb>
when he met her, turned and joined her sometimes<lb>
as she walked with the children, and fell into the way<lb>
of lounging near when she sat reading aloud to an<lb>
invalid friend on piazza or sea-shore. Christie much<lb>
preferred to have no auditor but kind Miss Tudor; but<lb>
finding the old lady enjoyed his chat she resigned herself,<lb>
and when he brought them new books as well as<lb>
himself, she became quite cordial.</p>
<pb n="074">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-085">

<figdesc>Page 074.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Everybody sauntered and lounged, so no one minded<lb>
the little group that met day after day among the rocks.<lb>
Christie read aloud, while the children revelled in sand,<lb>
shells, and puddles; Miss Tudor spun endless webs of<lb>
gay silk and wool; and Mr. Fletcher, with his hat over<lb>
his eyes, lay sunning himself like a luxurious lizard, as<lb>
he watched the face that grew daily fairer in his sight,<lb>
and listened to the pleasant voice that went reading on<lb>
till all his ills and <hi rend="italics">ennui</hi> seemed lulled to sleep as by<lb>
a spell.</p>
<p>A week or two of this new caprice set Christie to<lb>
thinking. She knew that Uncle Philip was not fond<lb>
of &ldquo;the darlings;&rdquo; it was evident that good Miss Tudor,<lb>
with her mild twaddle and eternal knitting, was<lb>
not the attraction, so she was forced to believe that he<lb>
came for her sake alone. She laughed at herself for<lb>
this fancy at first; but not possessing the sweet unconsciousness<lb>
of those heroines who can live through three<lb>
volumes with a burning passion before their eyes, and<lb>
never see it till the proper moment comes, and Eugene<lb>
goes down upon his knees, she soon felt sure that Mr.<lb>
Fletcher found her society agreeable, and wished her to<lb>
know it.</p>
<p>Being a mortal woman, her vanity was flattered, and<lb>
she found herself showing that she liked it by those<lb>
small signs and symbols which lovers' eyes are so quick<lb>
to see and understand, &mdash; an artful bow on her hat, a<lb>
flower in her belt, fresh muslin gowns, and the most<lb>
becoming arrangement of her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor man, he has so few pleasures I 'm sure I<lb>
needn't grudge him such a small one as looking at and<lb>
listening to me if he likes it,&rdquo; she said to herself one<lb>
<pb n="075">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-086">

<figdesc>Page 075.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
day, as she was preparing for her daily stroll with unusual<lb>
care. &ldquo;But how will it end? If he only wants a<lb>
mild flirtation he is welcome to it; but if he really<lb>
cares for me, I must make up my mind about it, and<lb>
not deceive him. I don't believe he loves me: how<lb>
can he? such an insignificant creature as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she looked in the glass, and as she looked the<lb>
color deepened in her cheek, her eyes shone, and a<lb>
smile would sit upon her lips, for the reflection showed<lb>
her a very winning face under the coquettish hat put<lb>
on to captivate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be foolish, Christie! Mind what you do, and<lb>
be sure vanity doesn't delude you, for you are only a<lb>
woman, and in things of this sort we are so blind and<lb>
silly. I 'll think of this possibility soberly, but I won't<lb>
flirt, and then which ever way I decide I shall have<lb>
nothing to reproach myself with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed with this virtuous resolution, Christie sternly<lb>
replaced the pretty hat with her old brown one, fastened<lb>
up a becoming curl, which of late she had worn<lb>
behind her ear, and put on a pair of stout, rusty boots,<lb>
much fitter for rocks and sand than the smart slippers<lb>
she was preparing to sacrifice. Then she trudged away<lb>
to Miss Tudor, bent on being very quiet and reserved,<lb>
as became a meek and lowly governess.</p>
<p>But, dear heart, how feeble are the resolutions of<lb>
womankind! When she found herself sitting in her<lb>
favorite nook, with the wide, blue sea glittering below,<lb>
the fresh wind making her blood dance in her veins,<lb>
and all the earth and sky so full of summer life and<lb>
loveliness, her heart <hi rend="italics">would</hi> sing for joy, her face <hi rend="italics">would</hi><lb>
shine with the mere bliss of living, and underneath<lb>
<pb n="076">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-087">

<figdesc>Page 076.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
all this natural content the new thought, half confessed,<lb>
yet very sweet, <hi rend="italics">would</hi> whisper, &ldquo;Somebody<lb>
cares for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had doubted it, the expression of Mr. Fletcher's<lb>
face that morning would have dispelled the doubt,<lb>
for, as she read, he was saying to himself: &ldquo;Yes, this<lb>
healthful, cheery, helpful creature is what I want to<lb>
make life pleasant. Every thing else is used up; why<lb>
not try this, and make the most of my last chance?<lb>
She does me good, and I don't seem to get tired of her.<lb>
I can't have a long life, they tell me, nor an easy one,<lb>
with the devil to pay with my vitals generally; so it<lb>
would be a wise thing to provide myself with a goodtempered,<lb>
faithful soul to take care of me. My fortune<lb>
would pay for loss of time, and my death leave her<lb>
a bonny widow. I won't be rash, but I think I 'll<lb>
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this mixture of tender, selfish, and regretful<lb>
thoughts in his mind, it is no wonder Mr. Fletcher's<lb>
eyes betrayed him, as he lay looking at Christie. Never<lb>
had she read so badly, for she could not keep her mind<lb>
on her book. It <hi rend="italics">would</hi> wander to that new and troublesome<lb>
fancy of hers; she could not help thinking that<lb>
Mr. Fletcher must have been a handsome man before<lb>
he was so ill; wondering if his temper was <hi rend="italics">very</hi> bad,<lb>
and fancying that he might prove both generous and<lb>
kind and true to one who loved and served him well.<lb>
At this point she was suddenly checked by a slip of the<lb>
tongue that covered her with confusion.</p>
<p>She was reading &ldquo;John Halifax,&rdquo; and instead of saying<lb>
&ldquo;Phineas Fletcher&rdquo; she said Philip, and then colored<lb>
to her forehead, and lost her place. Miss Tudor did<lb>
<pb n="077">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-088">

<figdesc>Page 077.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
not mind it, but Mr. Fletcher laughed, and Christie<lb>
thanked Heaven that her face was half hidden by the<lb>
old brown hat.</p>
<p>Nothing was said, but she was much relieved to find<lb>
that Mr. Fletcher had joined a yachting party next<lb>
day and he would be away for a week. During that<lb>
week Christie thought over the matter, and fancied she<lb>
had made up her mind. She recalled certain speeches<lb>
she had heard, and which had more weight with her than<lb>
she suspected. One dowager had said to another: &ldquo;P.<lb>
F. intends to marry, I assure you, for his sister told me<lb>
so, with tears in her eyes. Men who have been gay in<lb>
their youth make very good husbands when their wild<lb>
oats are sowed. Clara could not do better, and I should<lb>
be quite content to give her to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, I should be sorry to see my Augusta<lb>
his wife, for whoever he marries will be a perfect slave<lb>
to him. His fortune would be a nice thing if he did<lb>
not live long; but even for that my Augusta shall not be<lb>
sacrificed,&rdquo; returned the other matron whose Augusta<lb>
had vainly tried to captivate &ldquo;P. F.,&rdquo; and revenged<lb>
herself by calling him &ldquo;a wreck, my dear, a perfect<lb>
wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time Christie heard some girls discussing<lb>
the eligibility of several gentlemen, and Mr. Fletcher<lb>
was considered the best match among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do any thing you like with a husband a<lb>
good deal older than yourself. He 's happy with his<lb>
business, his club, and his dinner, and leaves you to do<lb>
what you please; just keep him comfortable and he 'll<lb>
pay your bills without much fuss,&rdquo; said one young thing<lb>
who had seen life at twenty.</p>
<pb n="078">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-089">

<figdesc>Page 078.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd take him if I had the chance, just because<lb>
everybody wants him. Don't admire him a particle,<lb>
but it will make a jolly stir whenever he does marry,<lb>
and I wouldn't mind having a hand in it,&rdquo; said the<lb>
second budding belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd take him for the diamonds alone. Mamma<lb>
says they are splendid, and have been in the family for<lb>
ages. He won't let Mrs. S. wear them, for they always<lb>
go to the eldest son's wife. Hope he 'll choose a handsome<lb>
woman who will show them off well,&rdquo; said a third<lb>
sweet girl, glancing at her own fine neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won't; he 'll take some poky old maid who will<lb>
cuddle him when he is sick, and keep out of his way<lb>
when he is well. See if he don't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him dawdling round with old Tudor, perhaps<lb>
he means to take her: she 's a capital nurse, got ill herself<lb>
taking care of her father, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he 's after the governess; she 's rather nice<lb>
looking, though she hasn 't a bit of style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, no! she 's a dowdy thing, always trailing<lb>
round with a book and those horrid children. No<lb>
danger of his marrying <hi rend="italics">her.</hi>&rdquo; And a derisive laugh<lb>
seemed to settle that question beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Christie, as the girls went trooping<lb>
out of the bath-house, where this pleasing chatter<lb>
had been carried on regardless of listeners. She called<lb>
them &ldquo;mercenary, worldly, unwomanly flirts,&rdquo; and felt<lb>
herself much their superior. Yet the memory of their<lb>
gossip haunted her, and had its influence upon her<lb>
decision, though she thought she came to it through<lb>
her own good judgment and discretion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he really cares for me I will listen, and not refuse<lb>
<pb n="079">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-090">

<figdesc>Page 079.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
till I know him well enough to decide. I 'm tired of<lb>
being alone, and should enjoy ease and pleasure so<lb>
much. He 's going abroad for the winter, and that<lb>
would be charming. I 'll try not to be worldly-minded<lb>
and marry without love, but it does look tempting to<lb>
a poor soul like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Christie made up her mind to accept, if this promotion<lb>
was offered her; and while she waited, went<lb>
through so many alternations of feeling, and was so<lb>
harassed by doubts and fears that she sometimes found<lb>
herself wishing it had never occurred to her.</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher, meantime, with the help of many meditative<lb>
cigars, was making up <hi rend="italics">his</hi> mind. Absence only<lb>
proved to him how much he needed a better time-killer<lb>
than billiards, horses, or newspapers, for the long, listless<lb>
days seemed endless without the cheerful governess<lb>
to tone him up, like a new and agreeable sort of<lb>
bitters. A gradually increasing desire to secure this<lb>
satisfaction had taken possession of him, and the<lb>
thought of always having a pleasant companion, with<lb>
no nerves, nonsense, or affectation about her, was an<lb>
inviting idea to a man tired of fashionable follies and<lb>
tormented with the <hi rend="italics">ennui</hi> of his own society.</p>
<p>The gossip, wonder, and chagrin such a step would<lb>
cause rather pleased his fancy; the excitement of trying<lb>
almost the only thing as yet untried allured him;<lb>
and deeper than all the desire to forget the past in a<lb>
better future led him to Christie by the nobler instincts<lb>
that never wholly die in any soul. He wanted her as<lb>
he had wanted many other things in his life, and had<lb>
little doubt that he could have her for the asking.<lb>
Even if love was not abounding, surely his fortune,<lb>
<pb n="080">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-091">

<figdesc>Page 080.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
which hitherto had procured him all he wished (except<lb>
health and happiness) could buy him a wife, when his<lb>
friends made better bargains every day. So, having<lb>
settled the question, he came home again, and every<lb>
one said the trip had done him a world of good.</p>
<p>Christie sat in her favorite nook one bright September<lb>
morning, with the inevitable children hunting hapless<lb>
crabs in a pool near by. A book lay on her knee,<lb>
but she was not reading; her eyes were looking far<lb>
across the blue waste before her with an eager gaze,<lb>
and her face was bright with some happy thought.<lb>
The sound of approaching steps disturbed her reverie,<lb>
and, recognizing them, she plunged into the heart of<lb>
the story, reading as if utterly absorbed, till a shadow<lb>
fell athwart the page, and the voice she had expected<lb>
to hear asked blandly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What book now, Miss Devon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Jane Eyre,' sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher sat down just where her hat-brim was<lb>
no screen, pulled off his gloves, and leisurely composed<lb>
himself for a comfortable lounge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your opinion of Rochester?&rdquo; he asked,<lb>
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very high one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think Jane was a fool to love and try to<lb>
make a saint of him, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Jane, but never can forgive her marrying that<lb>
man, as I haven't much faith in the saints such sinners<lb>
make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don't you think a man who had only follies to<lb>
regret might expect a good woman to lend him a hand<lb>
and make him happy?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="081">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-092">

<figdesc>Page 081.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="4* F">
<p>&ldquo;If he has wasted his life he must take the consequences,<lb>
and be content with pity and indifference,<lb>
instead of respect and love. Many good women do<lb>
`lend a hand,' as you say, and it is quite Christian and<lb>
amiable, I 've no doubt; but I cannot think it a fair<lb>
bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher liked to make Christie talk, for in the<lb>
interest of the subject she forgot herself, and her chief<lb>
charm for him was her earnestness. But just then the<lb>
earnestness did not seem to suit him, and he said, rather<lb>
sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hard-hearted creatures you women are sometimes!<lb>
Now, I fancied you were one of those who<lb>
wouldn't leave a poor fellow to his fate, if his salvation<lb>
lay in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't say what I should do in such a case; but it<lb>
always seemed to me that a man should have energy<lb>
enough to save himself, and not expect the `weaker<lb>
vessel,' as he calls her, to do it for him,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Christie, with a conscious look, for Mr. Fletcher's face<lb>
made her feel as if something was going to happen.</p>
<p>Evidently anxious to know what she <hi rend="italics">would</hi> do in<lb>
aforesaid case, Mr. Fletcher decided to put one before<lb>
her as speedily as possible, so he said, in a pensive tone,<lb>
and with a wistful glance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You looked very happy just now when I came up.<lb>
I wish I could believe that my return had any thing to<lb>
do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie wished she could control her tell-tale color,<lb>
but finding she could not, looked hard at the sea, and,<lb>
ignoring his tender insinuation, said, with suspicious<lb>
enthusiasm:</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of what Mrs. Saltonstall said this<lb>
morning. She asked me if I would like to go to Paris<lb>
with her for the winter. It has always been one of my<lb>
dreams to go abroad, and I do hope I shall not be disappointed.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>Christie's blush seemed to be a truer answer than her<lb>
words, and, leaning a little nearer, Mr. Fletcher said,<lb>
in his most persuasive tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go to Paris as <hi rend="italics">my</hi> governess, instead of<lb>
Charlotte's?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie thought her reply was all ready; but when<lb>
the moment came, she found it was not, and sat silent,<lb>
feeling as if that &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; would promise far more than<lb>
she could give. Mr. Fletcher had no doubt what the<lb>
answer would be, and was in no haste to get it, for that<lb>
was one of the moments that are so pleasant and so<lb>
short-lived they should be enjoyed to the uttermost.<lb>
He liked to watch her color come and go, to see the<lb>
asters on her bosom tremble with the quickened beating<lb>
of her heart, and tasted, in anticipation, the satisfaction<lb>
of the moment when that pleasant voice of<lb>
hers would falter out its grateful assent. Drawing yet<lb>
nearer, he went on, still in the persuasive tone that<lb>
would have been more lover-like if it had been less<lb>
assured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am not mistaken in believing that you<lb>
care for me a little. You must know how fond I am<lb>
of you, how much I need you, and how glad I should<lb>
be to give all I have if I might keep you always to<lb>
make my hard life happy. May I, Christie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would soon tire of me. I have no beauty, no<lb>
accomplishments, no fortune, &mdash; nothing but my heart<lb>
<pb n="083">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-094">

<figdesc>Page 083.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and my hand to give the man I marry. Is that enough?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Christie, looking at him with eyes that betrayed<lb>
the hunger of an empty heart longing to be fed with<lb>
genuine food.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fletcher did not understand its meaning;<lb>
he saw the humility in her face, thought she was overcome<lb>
by the weight of the honor he did her, and tried<lb>
to reassure her with the gracious air of one who wishes<lb>
to lighten the favor he confers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might not be for some men, but it is for me,<lb>
because I want you very much. Let people say what<lb>
they will, if you say yes I am satisfied. You shall not<lb>
regret it, Christie; I 'll do my best to make you happy;<lb>
you shall travel wherever I can go with you, have what<lb>
you like, if possible, and when we come back by and<lb>
by, you shall take your place in the world as my wife.<lb>
You will fill it well, I fancy, and I shall be a happy<lb>
man. I 've had my own way all my life, and I mean to<lb>
have it now, so smile, and say, `Yes, Philip,' like a<lb>
sweet soul, as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Christie did not smile, and felt no inclination to<lb>
say &ldquo;Yes, Philip,&rdquo; for that last speech of his jarred on<lb>
her ear. The tone of unconscious condescension in it<lb>
wounded the woman's sensitive pride; self was too<lb>
apparent, and the most generous words seemed to her<lb>
like bribes. This was not the lover she had dreamed<lb>
of, the brave, true man who gave her all, and felt it<lb>
could not half repay the treasure of her innocent, first<lb>
love. This was not the happiness she had hoped for,<lb>
the perfect faith, the glad surrender, the sweet content<lb>
that made all things possible, and changed this work-a-day<lb>
world into a heaven while the joy lasted.</p>

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>She had decided to say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but her heart said<lb>
&ldquo;no&rdquo; decidedly, and with instinctive loyalty she obeyed<lb>
it, even while she seemed to yield to the temptation<lb>
which appeals to three of the strongest foibles in most<lb>
women's nature, &mdash; vanity, ambition, and the love of<lb>
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, but you may repent it, you<lb>
know so little of me,&rdquo; she began, trying to soften her<lb>
refusal, but sadly hindered by a feeling of contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know more about you than you think; but it<lb>
makes no difference,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Fletcher, with a<lb>
smile that irritated Christie, even before she understood<lb>
its significance. &ldquo;I thought it would at first, but I<lb>
found I couldn't get on without you, so I made up my<lb>
mind to forgive and forget that my wife had ever been<lb>
an actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie had forgotten it, and it would have been<lb>
well for him if he had held his tongue. Now she<lb>
understood the tone that had chilled her, the smile that<lb>
angered her, and Mr. Fletcher's fate was settled in the<lb>
drawing of a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; she asked, quickly, while<lb>
every nerve tingled with the mortification of being<lb>
found out then and there in the one secret of her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you dancing on the beach with the children<lb>
one day, and it reminded me of an actress I had once<lb>
seen. I should not have remembered it but for the<lb>
accident which impressed it on my mind. Powder,<lb>
paint, and costume made `Miss Douglas' a very different<lb>
woman from Miss Devon, but a few cautious inquiries<lb>
settled the matter, and I then understood where<lb>
you got that slight <hi rend="italics">soup&ccedil;on</hi> of dash and daring which<lb>
<pb n="085">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-096">

<figdesc>Page 085.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
makes our demure governess so charming when with<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Mr. Fletcher smiled again, and kissed<lb>
his hand to her with a dramatic little gesture that exasperated<lb>
Christie beyond measure. She would not make<lb>
light of it, as he did, and submit to be forgiven for a<lb>
past she was not ashamed of. Heartily wishing she<lb>
had been frank at first, she resolved to have it out now,<lb>
and accept nothing Mr. Fletcher offered her, not even<lb>
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, as steadily as she could, &ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> an<lb>
actress for three years, and though it was a hard life it<lb>
was an honest one, and I 'm not ashamed of it. I<lb>
ought to have told Mrs. Saltonstall, but I was warned<lb>
that if I did it would be difficult to find a place, people<lb>
are so prejudiced. I sincerely regret it now, and<lb>
shall tell her at once, so you may save yourself the<lb>
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, I never dreamed of telling any one!&rdquo;<lb>
cried Mr. Fletcher in an injured tone. &ldquo;I beg you<lb>
won't speak, but trust me, and let it be a little secret<lb>
between us two. I assure you it makes no difference<lb>
to me, for I should marry an opera dancer if I chose,<lb>
so forget it, as I do, and set my mind at rest upon the<lb>
other point. I 'm still waiting for my answer, you<lb>
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind one, I 'm sure. What is it, Christie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not in earnest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher got up suddenly and set his back against<lb>
<pb n="86"><target id="p445-097">p445-097</target>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-097">
<head>&ldquo;No, I thank you.&rdquo;</head>
<figdesc>Page 086. In-line image of Mr. Fletcher and Miss Devon talking by the seashore.</figdesc>

the rock, saying in a tone of such unaffected surprise<lb>
and disappointment that her heart reproached her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand that as your final answer, Miss<lb>
Devon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distinctly and decidedly my final answer, Mr.<lb>
Fletcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie tried to speak kindly, but she was angry<lb>
with herself and him, and unconsciously showed it both<lb>
in face and voice, for she was no actress off the stage,<lb>
and wanted to be very true just then as a late atonement<lb>
for that earlier want of candor.</p>
<pb n="087">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-098">

<figdesc>Page 087.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>A quick change passed over Mr. Fletcher's face; his<lb>
cold eyes kindled with an angry spark, his lips were<lb>
pale with anger, and his voice was very bitter, as he<lb>
slowly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 've made many blunders in my life, and this is<lb>
one of the greatest; for I believed in a woman, was<lb>
fool enough to care for her with the sincerest love I<lb>
ever knew, and fancied that she would be grateful for<lb>
the sacrifice I made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further, for Christie rose straight up and<lb>
answered him with all the indignation she felt burning<lb>
in her face and stirring the voice she tried in vain to<lb>
keep as steady as his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sacrifice would not have been <hi rend="italics">all</hi> yours, for it<lb>
is what we <hi rend="italics">are,</hi> not what we <hi rend="italics">have,</hi> that makes one<lb>
human being superior to another. I am as well-born<lb>
as you in spite of my poverty; my life, I think, has<lb>
been a better one than yours; my heart, I know, is<lb>
fresher, and my memory has fewer faults and follies to<lb>
reproach me with. What can you give me but money<lb>
and position in return for the youth and freedom I<lb>
should sacrifice in marrying you? Not love, for you<lb>
count the cost of your bargain, as no true lover could,<lb>
and you reproach me for deceit when in your heart you<lb>
know you only cared for me because I can amuse and<lb>
serve you. I too deceived myself, I too see my mistake,<lb>
and I decline the honor you would do me, since it<lb>
is so great in your eyes that you must remind me of it<lb>
as you offer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the excitement of the moment Christie unconsciously<lb>
spoke with something of her old dramatic fervor<lb>
in voice and gesture; Mr. Fletcher saw it, and,<lb>
<pb n="088">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-099">

<figdesc>Page 088.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
while he never had admired her so much, could not<lb>
resist avenging himself for the words that angered him,<lb>
the more deeply for their truth. Wounded vanity and<lb>
baffled will can make an ungenerous man as spiteful as<lb>
a woman; and Mr. Fletcher proved it then, for he saw<lb>
where Christie's pride was sorest, and touched the<lb>
wound with the skill of a resentful nature.</p>
<p>As she paused, he softly clapped his hands, saying,<lb>
with a smile that made her eyes flash:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well done! infinitely superior to your `Woffington,'<lb>
Miss Devon. I am disappointed in the woman,<lb>
but I make my compliment to the actress, and leave<lb>
the stage free for another and a more successful Romeo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still smiling, he bowed and went away apparently<lb>
quite calm and much amused, but a more wrathful, disappointed<lb>
man never crossed those sands than the one<lb>
who kicked his dog and swore at himself for a fool that<lb>
day when no one saw him.</p>
<p>For a minute Christie stood and watched him, then,<lb>
feeling that she must either laugh or cry, wisely chose<lb>
the former vent for her emotions, and sat down feeling<lb>
inclined to look at the whole scene from a ludicrous<lb>
point of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My second love affair is a worse failure than my<lb>
first, for I did pity poor Joe, but this man is detestable,<lb>
and I never will forgive him that last insult. I dare<lb>
say I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> absurdly tragical, I 'm apt to be when very<lb>
angry, but what a temper he has got! The white, cold<lb>
kind, that smoulders and stabs, instead of blazing up<lb>
and being over in a minute. Thank Heaven, I 'm not<lb>
his wife! Well, I 've made an enemy and lost my<lb>
place, for of course Mrs. Saltonstall won't keep me<lb>
<pb n="089">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-100">

<figdesc>Page 089.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
after this awful discovery. I 'll tell her at once, for I<lb>
will have no `little secrets' with him. No Paris either,<lb>
and that 's the worst of it all! Never mind, I haven't<lb>
sold my liberty for the Fletcher diamonds, and that 's<lb>
a comfort. Now a short scene with my lady and then<lb>
exit governess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though she laughed, Christie felt troubled at the<lb>
part she had played in this affair; repented of her<lb>
worldly aspirations; confessed her vanity; accepted<lb>
her mortification and disappointment as a just punishment<lb>
for her sins; and yet at the bottom of her heart<lb>
she did enjoy it mightily.</p>
<p>She tried to spare Mr. Fletcher in her interview with<lb>
his sister, and only betrayed her own iniquities. But,<lb>
to her surprise, Mrs. Saltonstall, though much disturbed<lb>
at the discovery, valued Christie as a governess, and<lb>
respected her as a woman, so she was willing to bury<lb>
the past, she said, and still hoped Miss Devon would<lb>
remain.</p>
<p>Then Christie was forced to tell her why it was impossible<lb>
for her to do so; and, in her secret soul, she<lb>
took a naughty satisfaction in demurely mentioning<lb>
that she had refused my lord.</p>
<p>Mrs. Saltonstall's consternation was comical, for she<lb>
had been so absorbed in her own affairs she had suspected<lb>
nothing; and horror fell upon her when she<lb>
learned how near dear Philip had been to the fate from<lb>
which she jealously guarded him, that his property<lb>
might one day benefit the darlings.</p>
<p>In a moment every thing was changed; and it was<lb>
evident to Christie that the sooner she left the better it<lb>
would suit madame. The proprieties were preserved<lb>
<pb n="090">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-101">

<figdesc>Page 090.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to the end, and Mrs. Saltonstall treated her with unusual<lb>
respect, for she had come to honor, and also conducted<lb>
herself in a most praiseworthy manner. How<lb>
she could refuse a Fletcher visibly amazed the lady;<lb>
but she forgave the slight, and gently insinuated that<lb>
&ldquo;my brother&rdquo; was, perhaps, only amusing himself.</p>
<p>Christie was but too glad to be off; and when Mrs.<lb>
Saltonstall asked when she would prefer to leave,<lb>
promptly replied, &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; received her salary,<lb>
which was forthcoming with unusual punctuality, and<lb>
packed her trunks with delightful rapidity.</p>
<p>As the family was to leave in a week, her sudden<lb>
departure caused no surprise to the few who knew her,<lb>
and with kind farewells to such of her summer friends<lb>
as still remained, she went to bed that night all ready<lb>
for an early start. She saw nothing more of Mr.<lb>
Fletcher that day, but the sound of excited voices in<lb>
the drawing-room assured her that madame was having<lb>
it out with her brother; and with truly feminine inconsistency<lb>
Christie hoped that she would not be too hard<lb>
upon the poor man, for, after all, it was kind of him to<lb>
overlook the actress, and ask the governess to share his<lb>
good things with him.</p>
<p>She did not repent, but she got herself to sleep,<lb>
imagining a bridal trip to Paris, and dreamed so<lb>
delightfully of lost splendors that the awakening was<lb>
rather blank, the future rather cold and hard.</p>
<p>She was early astir, meaning to take the first boat<lb>
and so escape all disagreeable <hi rend="italics">rencontres,</hi> and having<lb>
kissed the children in their little beds, with tender<lb>
promises not to forget them, she took a hasty breakfast<lb>
and stepped into the carriage waiting at the door. The<lb>
<pb n="091">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-102">

<figdesc>Page 091.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sleepy waiters stared, a friendly housemaid nodded,<lb>
and Miss Walker, the hearty English lady who did her<lb>
ten miles a day, cried out, as she tramped by, blooming<lb>
and bedraggled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, are you off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank Heaven!&rdquo; answered Christie; but as<lb>
she spoke Mr. Fletcher came down the steps looking as<lb>
wan and heavy-eyed as if a sleepless night had been<lb>
added to his day's defeat. Leaning in at the window,<lb>
he asked abruptly, but with a look she never could<lb>
forget:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will nothing change your answer, Christie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes said, &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; but his lips only said,<lb>
&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; and the carriage rolled away.</p>
<p>Then, being a woman, two great tears fell on the<lb>
hand still red with the lingering grasp he had given it,<lb>
and Christie said, as pitifully as if she loved him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <hi rend="italics">has</hi> got a heart, after all, and perhaps I might<lb>
have been glad to fill it if he had only shown it to me<lb>
sooner. Now it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>BEFORE she had time to find a new situation,<lb>
Christie received a note from Miss Tudor, saying<lb>
that hearing she had left Mrs. Saltonstall she wanted<lb>
to offer her the place of companion to an invalid girl,<lb>
where the duties were light and the compensation large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind of her to think of me,&rdquo; said Christie,<lb>
gratefully. &ldquo;I 'll go at once and do my best to secure<lb>
it, for it must be a good thing or she wouldn't recommend<lb>
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away went Christie to the address sent by Miss<lb>
Tudor, and as she waited at the door she thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a happy family the Carrols must be!&rdquo; for the<lb>
house was one of an imposing block in a West End<lb>
square, which had its own little park where a fountain<lb>
sparkled in the autumn sunshine, and pretty children<lb>
played among the fallen leaves.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carrol was a stately woman, still beautiful in<lb>
spite of her fifty years. But though there were few<lb>
lines on her forehead, few silver threads in the dark<lb>
hair that lay smoothly over it, and a gracious smile<lb>
showed the fine teeth, an indescribable expression of<lb>
unsubmissive sorrow touched the whole face, betraying<lb>
that life had brought some heavy cross, from which her<lb>
<pb n="093">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-104">

<figdesc>Page 093.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
wealth could purchase no release, for which her pride<lb>
could find no effectual screen.</p>
<p>She looked at Christie with a searching eye, listened<lb>
attentively when she spoke, and seemed testing her<lb>
with covert care as if the place she was to fill demanded<lb>
some unusual gift or skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Tudor tells me that you read aloud well, sing<lb>
sweetly, possess a cheerful temper, and the quiet, patient<lb>
ways which are peculiarly grateful to an invalid,&rdquo; began<lb>
Mrs. Carrol, with that keen yet wistful gaze, and an<lb>
anxious accent in her voice that went to Christie's<lb>
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Tudor is very kind to think so well of me and<lb>
my few accomplishments. I have never been with an<lb>
invalid, but I think I can promise to be patient, willing,<lb>
and cheerful. My own experience of illness has taught<lb>
me how to sympathize with others and love to lighten<lb>
pain. I shall be very glad to try if you think I have<lb>
any fitness for the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; and Mrs. Carrol's face softened as she spoke,<lb>
for something in Christie's words or manner seemed to<lb>
please her. Then slowly, as if the task was a hard one,<lb>
she added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter has been very ill and is still weak and<lb>
nervous. I must hint to you that the loss of one very<lb>
dear to her was the cause of the illness and the melancholy<lb>
which now oppresses her. Therefore we must<lb>
avoid any thing that can suggest or recall this trouble.<lb>
She cares for nothing as yet, will see no one, and prefers<lb>
to live alone. She is still so feeble this is but<lb>
natural; yet solitude is bad for her, and her physician<lb>
thinks that a new face might rouse her, and the society<lb>
<pb n="094">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-105">

<figdesc>Page 094.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
of one in no way connected with the painful past might<lb>
interest and do her good. You see it is a little difficult<lb>
to find just what we want, for a young companion is<lb>
best, yet must be discreet and firm, as few young people<lb>
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fancying from Mrs. Carrol's manner that Miss Tudor<lb>
had said more in her favor than had been repeated to<lb>
her, Christie in a few plain words told her little story,<lb>
resolving to have no concealments here, and feeling<lb>
that perhaps her experiences might have given her<lb>
more firmness and discretion than many women of her<lb>
age possessed. Mrs. Carrol seemed to find it so; the<lb>
anxious look lifted a little as she listened, and when<lb>
Christie ended she said, with a sigh of relief:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think Miss Tudor is right, and you <hi rend="italics">are</hi> the<lb>
one we want. Come and try it for a week and then we<lb>
can decide. Can you begin to-day?&rdquo; she added, as<lb>
Christie rose. &ldquo;Every hour is precious, for my poor<lb>
girl's sad solitude weighs on my heart, and this is my<lb>
one hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will stay with pleasure,&rdquo; answered Christie, thinking<lb>
Mrs. Carrol's anxiety excessive, yet pitying the<lb>
mother's pain, for something in her face suggested the<lb>
idea that she reproached herself in some way for her<lb>
daughter's state.</p>
<p>With secret gratitude that she had dressed with care,<lb>
Christie took off her things and followed Mrs. Carrol<lb>
upstairs. Entering a room in what seemed to be a<lb>
wing of the great house, they found an old woman<lb>
sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Helen to-day, Nurse?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Carrol,<lb>
pausing.</p>
<pb n="095">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-106">

<figdesc>Page 095.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poorly, ma'am. I 've been in every hour, but she<lb>
only says: `Let me be quiet,' and lies looking up at the<lb>
picture till it 's fit to break your heart to see her,&rdquo;<lb>
answered the woman, with a shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought Miss Devon to sit with her a little<lb>
while. Doctor advises it, and I fancy the experiment<lb>
may succeed if we can only amuse the dear child, and<lb>
make her forget herself and her troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, ma'am,&rdquo; said the old woman, looking<lb>
with little favor at the new-comer, for the good soul<lb>
was jealous of any interference between herself and<lb>
the child she had tended for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won't disturb her, but you shall take Miss Devon<lb>
in and tell Helen mamma sends her love, and hopes<lb>
she will make an effort for all our sakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, my dear, and do your best.&rdquo; With these words<lb>
Mrs. Carrol hastily left the room, and Christie followed<lb>
Nurse.</p>
<p>A quick glance showed her that she was in the daintily<lb>
furnished boudoir of a rich man's daughter, but<lb>
before she could take a second look her eyes were<lb>
arrested by the occupant of this pretty place, and she<lb>
forgot all else. On a low luxurious couch lay a girl, so<lb>
beautiful and pale and still, that for an instant Christie<lb>
thought her dead or sleeping. She was neither, for at<lb>
the sound of a voice the great eyes opened wide, darkening<lb>
and dilating with a strange expression as they<lb>
fell on the unfamiliar face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse, who is that? I told you I would see no<lb>
one. I 'm too ill to be so worried,&rdquo; she said, in an imperious<lb>
tone.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I know, but your mamma wished you to<lb>
make an effort. Miss Devon is to sit with you and try<lb>
to cheer you up a bit,&rdquo; said the old woman in a dissatisfied<lb>
tone, that contrasted strangely with the tender<lb>
way in which she stroked the beautiful disordered hair<lb>
that hung about the girl's shoulders.</p>
<p>Helen knit her brows and looked most ungracious,<lb>
but evidently tried to be civil, for with a courteous<lb>
wave of her hand toward an easy chair in the sunny<lb>
window she said, quietly:</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="5 G">
<p>&ldquo;Please sit down, Miss Devon, and excuse me for a<lb>
little while. I 've had a bad night, and am too tired to<lb>
talk just yet. There are books of all sorts, or the conservatory<lb>
if you like it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I 'll read quietly till you want me.<lb>
Then I shall be very glad to do any thing I can for<lb>
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Christie retired to the big chair, and fell<lb>
to reading the first book she took up, a good deal embarrassed<lb>
by her reception, and very curious to know<lb>
what would come next.</p>
<p>The old woman went away after folding the down<lb>
coverlet carefully over her darling's feet, and Helen<lb>
seemed to go to sleep.</p>
<p>For a time the room was very still; the fire burned<lb>
softly on the marble hearth, the sun shone warmly on<lb>
velvet carpet and rich hangings, the delicate breath of<lb>
flowers blew in through the half-open door that led to<lb>
a gay little conservatory, and nothing but the roll of a<lb>
distant carriage broke the silence now and then.</p>
<p>Christie's eyes soon wandered from her book to the<lb>
lovely face and motionless figure on the couch. Just<lb>
opposite, in a recess, hung the portrait of a young and<lb>
handsome man, and below it stood a vase of flowers, a<lb>
graceful Roman lamp, and several little relics, as if it<lb>
were the shrine where some dead love was mourned<lb>
and worshipped still.</p>
<p>As she looked from the living face, so pale and so<lb>
pathetic in its quietude, to the painted one so full of<lb>
color, strength, and happiness, her heart ached for poor<lb>
Helen, and her eyes were wet with tears of pity. A<lb>
sudden movement on the couch gave her no time to<lb>
<pb n="098">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-109">

<figdesc>Page 098.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hide them, and as she hastily looked down upon her<lb>
book a treacherous drop fell glittering on the page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you there so interesting?&rdquo; asked Helen,<lb>
in that softly imperious tone of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; answered Christie, too much abashed<lb>
to have her wits about her.</p>
<p>Helen smiled a melancholy smile as she rose, saying<lb>
wearily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They gave me that to make me laugh, but I did not<lb>
find it funny; neither was it sad enough to make me<lb>
cry as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not reading, I was&rdquo; &mdash; there Christie broke<lb>
down, and could have cried with vexation at the bad<lb>
beginning she had made. But that involuntary tear<lb>
was better balm to Helen than the most perfect tact,<lb>
the most brilliant conversation. It touched and won<lb>
her without words, for sympathy works miracles. Her<lb>
whole face changed, and her mournful eyes grew soft<lb>
as with the gentle freedom of a child she lifted Christie's<lb>
downcast face and said, with a falter in her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you were pitying me. Well, I need pity, and<lb>
from you I 'll take it, because you don't force it on me.<lb>
Have <hi rend="italics">you</hi> been ill and wretched too? I think so, else<lb>
you would never care to come and shut yourself up<lb>
here with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been ill, and I know how hard it is to get<lb>
one's spirits back again. I 've had my troubles, too,<lb>
but not heavier than I could bear, thank God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you ill? Would you mind telling me<lb>
about it? I seem to fancy hearing other people's woes,<lb>
though it can't make mine seem lighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of the Castle of the Sun fell on my head<lb>
<pb n="099">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-110">

<figdesc>Page 099.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and nearly killed me,&rdquo; and Christie laughed in spite of<lb>
herself at the astonishment in Helen's face. &ldquo;I was<lb>
an actress once; your mother knows and didn't mind,&rdquo;<lb>
she added, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm glad of that. I used to wish I could be one, I<lb>
was so fond of the theatre. They should have consented,<lb>
it would have given me something to do, and,<lb>
however hard it is, it couldn't be worse than this.&rdquo;<lb>
Helen spoke vehemently and an excited flush rose to<lb>
her white cheeks; then she checked herself and dropped<lb>
into a chair, saying, hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell about it: don't let me think; it 's bad for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glad to be set to work, and bent on retrieving her<lb>
first mistake, Christie plunged into her theatrical experiences<lb>
and talked away in her most lively style. People<lb>
usually get eloquent when telling their own stories,<lb>
and true tales are always the most interesting. Helen<lb>
listened at first with a half-absent air, but presently<lb>
grew more attentive, and when the catastrophe came<lb>
sat erect, quite absorbed in the interest of this glimpse<lb>
behind the curtain.</p>
<p>Charmed with her success, Christie branched off right<lb>
and left, stimulated by questions, led on by suggestive<lb>
incidents, and generously supplied by memory. Before<lb>
she knew it, she was telling her whole history in the<lb>
most expansive manner, for women soon get sociable<lb>
together, and Helen's interest flattered her immensely.<lb>
Once she made her laugh at some droll trifle, and as if<lb>
the unaccustomed sound had startled her, old nurse<lb>
popped in her head; but seeing nothing amiss retired,<lb>
wondering what on earth that girl could be doing to<lb>
cheer up Miss Helen so.</p>
<pb n="100">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-111">

<figdesc>Page 100.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell about your lovers: you must have had some;<lb>
actresses always do. Happy women, they can love as<lb>
they like!&rdquo; said Helen, with the inquisitive frankness<lb>
of an invalid for whom etiquette has ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Remembering in time that this was a forbidden subject,<lb>
Christie smiled and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a few, but one does not tell those secrets, you<lb>
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently disappointed, and a little displeased at<lb>
being reminded of her want of good-breeding, Helen<lb>
got up and began to wander restlessly about the room.<lb>
Presently, as if wishing to atone for her impatience,<lb>
she bade Christie come and see her flowers. Following<lb>
her, the new companion found herself in a little world<lb>
where perpetual summer reigned. Vines curtained the<lb>
roof, slender shrubs and trees made leafy walls on either<lb>
side, flowers bloomed above and below, birds carolled<lb>
in half-hidden prisons, aquariums and ferneries stood<lb>
all about, and the soft plash of a little fountain made<lb>
pleasant music as it rose and fell.</p>
<p>Helen threw herself wearily down on a pile of cushions<lb>
that lay beside the basin, and beckoning Christie<lb>
to sit near, said, as she pressed her hands to her hot<lb>
forehead and looked up with a distressful brightness in<lb>
the haggard eyes that seemed to have no rest in them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sing to me; any humdrum air will do. I<lb>
am so tired, and yet I cannot sleep. If my head would<lb>
only stop this dreadful thinking and let me forget one<lb>
hour it would do me so much good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the feeling, and I 'll try what Lucy used to<lb>
do to quiet me. Put your poor head in my lap, dear,<lb>
and lie quite still while I cool and comfort it.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="101">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-112">

<figdesc>Page 101.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Obeying like a worn-out child, Helen lay motionless<lb>
while Christie, dipping her fingers in the basin, passed<lb>
the wet tips softly to and fro across the hot forehead,<lb>
and the thin temples where the pulses throbbed so fast.<lb>
And while she soothed she sang the &ldquo;Land o' the Leal,&rdquo;<lb>
and sang it well; for the tender words, the plaintive<lb>
air were dear to her, because her mother loved and<lb>
sang it to her years ago. Slowly the heavy eyelids<lb>
drooped, slowly the lines of pain were smoothed away<lb>
from the broad brow, slowly the restless hands grew<lb>
still, and Helen lay asleep.</p>
<p>So intent upon her task was Christie, that she forgot<lb>
herself till the discomfort of her position reminded her<lb>
that she had a body. Fearing to wake the poor girl in<lb>
her arms, she tried to lean against the basin, but could<lb>
not reach a cushion to lay upon the cold stone ledge.<lb>
An unseen hand supplied the want, and, looking round,<lb>
she saw two young men standing behind her.</p>
<p>Helen's brothers, without doubt; for, though utterly<lb>
unlike in expression, some of the family traits were<lb>
strongly marked in both. The elder wore the dress of<lb>
a priest, had a pale, ascetic face, with melancholy eyes,<lb>
stern mouth, and the absent air of one who leads an<lb>
inward life. The younger had a more attractive face,<lb>
for, though bearing marks of dissipation, it betrayed a<lb>
generous, ardent nature, proud and wilful, yet lovable<lb>
in spite of all defects. He was very boyish still, and<lb>
plainly showed how much he felt, as, with a hasty nod<lb>
to Christie, he knelt down beside his sister, saying, in a<lb>
whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at her, Augustine! so beautiful, so quiet!<lb>
What a comfort it is to see her like herself again.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="102">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-113">

<figdesc>Page 102.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; and but for the sin of it, I could find it in<lb>
my heart to wish she might never wake!&rdquo; returned the<lb>
other, gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't say that! How could we live without her?&rdquo;<lb>
Then, turning to Christie, the younger said, in a friendly<lb>
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be very tired; let us lay her on the sofa.<lb>
It is very damp here, and if she sleeps long you will<lb>
faint from weariness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully lifting her, the brothers carried the sleeping<lb>
girl into her room, and laid her down. She sighed<lb>
as her head touched the pillow, and her arm clung to<lb>
Harry's neck, as if she felt his nearness even in sleep.<lb>
He put his cheek to hers, and lingered over her with<lb>
an affectionate solicitude beautiful to see. Augustine<lb>
stood silent, grave and cold as if he had done with<lb>
human ties, yet found it hard to sever this one, for he<lb>
stretched his hand above his sister as if he blessed her,<lb>
then, with another grave bow to Christie, went away<lb>
as noiselessly as he had come. But Harry kissed the<lb>
sleeper tenderly, whispered, &ldquo;Be kind to her,&rdquo; with an<lb>
imploring voice, and hurried from the room as if to<lb>
hide the feeling that he must not show.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the nurse brought in a note from<lb>
Mrs. Carrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son tells me that Helen is asleep, and you look<lb>
very tired. Leave her to Hester, now; you have done<lb>
enough to-day, so let me thank you heartily, and send<lb>
you home for a quiet night before you continue your<lb>
good work to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie went, found a carriage waiting for her, and<lb>
drove home very happy at the success of her first<lb>
attempt at companionship.</p>
<pb n="103">

<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-114">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The next day she entered upon the new duties with<lb>
interest and good-will, for this was work in which heart<lb>
took part, as well as head and hand. Many things<lb>
surprised, and some things perplexed her, as she came<lb>
to know the family better. But she discreetly held her<lb>
tongue, used her eyes, and did her best to please.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carrol seemed satisfied, often thanked her for<lb>
her faithfulness to Helen, but seldom visited her daughter,<lb>
never seemed surprised or grieved that the girl<lb>
expressed no wish to see her; and, though her handsome<lb>
face always wore its gracious smile, Christie soon<lb>
felt very sure that it was a mask put on to hide some<lb>
heavy sorrow from a curious world.</p>
<p>Augustine never came except when Helen was asleep:<lb>
then, like a shadow, he passed in and out, always silent,<lb>
cold, and grave, but in his eyes the gloom of some<lb>
remorseful pain that prayers and penances seemed powerless<lb>
to heal.</p>
<p>Harry came every day, and no matter how melancholy,<lb>
listless, or irritable his sister might be, for him<lb>
she always had a smile, an affectionate greeting, a word<lb>
of praise, or a tender warning against the reckless spirit<lb>
that seemed to possess him. The love between them<lb>
was very strong, and Christie found a never-failing<lb>
pleasure in watching them together, for then Helen<lb>
showed what she once had been, and Harry was his best<lb>
self. A boy still, in spite of his one-and-twenty years,<lb>
he seemed to feel that Helen's room was a safe refuge<lb>
from the temptations that beset one of his thoughtless<lb>
and impetuous nature. Here he came to confess his<lb>
faults and follies with the frankness which is half sad,<lb>
half comical, and wholly charming in a good-hearted<lb>
<pb n="104">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-115">

<figdesc>Page 104.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
young scatter-brain. Here he brought gay gossip, lively<lb>
descriptions, and masculine criticisms of the world he<lb>
moved in. All his hopes and plans, joys and sorrows,<lb>
successes and defeats, he told to Helen. And she, poor<lb>
soul, in this one happy love of her sad life, forgot a<lb>
little the burden of despair that darkened all the world<lb>
to her. For his sake she smiled, to him she talked<lb>
when others got no word from her, and Harry's salvation<lb>
was the only duty that she owned or tried to fulfil.</p>
<p>A younger sister was away at school, but the others<lb>
seldom spoke of her, and Christie tired herself with<lb>
wondering why Bella never wrote to Helen, and why<lb>
Harry seemed to have nothing but a gloomy sort of<lb>
pity to bestow upon the blooming girl whose picture<lb>
hung in the great drawing-room below.</p>
<p>It was a very quiet winter, yet a very pleasant one<lb>
to Christie, for she felt herself loved and trusted, saw<lb>
that she suited, and believed that she was doing good,<lb>
as women best love to do it, by bestowing sympathy<lb>
and care with generous devotion.</p>
<p>Helen and Harry loved her like an elder sister;<lb>
Augustine showed that he was grateful, and Mrs. Carrol<lb>
sometimes forgot to put on her mask before one who<lb>
seemed fast becoming <hi rend="italics">confidante</hi> as well as companion.</p>
<p>In the spring the family went to the fine old countryhouse<lb>
just out of town, and here Christie and her<lb>
charge led a freer, happier life. Walking and driving,<lb>
boating and gardening, with pleasant days on the wide<lb>
terrace, where Helen swung idly in her hammock, while<lb>
Christie read or talked to her; and summer twilights<lb>
beguiled with music, or the silent reveries more eloquent<lb>
than speech, which real friends may enjoy<lb>
<pb n="105">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-116">

<figdesc>Page 105.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="5*">
together, and find the sweeter for the mute companionship.<lb>
</p>
<p>Harry was with them, and devoted to his sister, who<lb>
seemed slowly to be coming out of her sad gloom, won<lb>
by patient tenderness and the cheerful influences all<lb>
about her.</p>
<p>Christie's heart was full of pride and satisfaction, as<lb>
she saw the altered face, heard the tone of interest in<lb>
that once hopeless voice, and felt each day more sure<lb>
that Helen had outlived the loss that seemed to have<lb>
broken her heart.</p>
<p>Alas, for Christie's pride, for Harry's hope, and for<lb>
poor Helen's bitter fate! When all was brightest, the<lb>
black shadow came; when all looked safest, danger<lb>
was at hand; and when the past seemed buried, the<lb>
ghost which haunted it returned, for the punishment<lb>
of a broken law is as inevitable as death.</p>
<p>When settled in town again Bella came home, a gay,<lb>
young girl, who should have brought sunshine and happiness<lb>
into her home. But from the hour she returned<lb>
a strange anxiety seemed to possess the others. Mrs.<lb>
Carrol watched over her with sleepless care, was evidently<lb>
full of maternal pride in the lovely creature, and<lb>
began to dream dreams about her future. She seemed<lb>
to wish to keep the sisters apart, and said to Christie,<lb>
as if to explain this wish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bella was away when Helen's trouble and illness<lb>
came, she knows very little of it, and I do not want<lb>
her to be saddened by the knowledge. Helen cares<lb>
only for Hal, and Bella is too young to be of any use<lb>
to my poor girl; therefore the less they see of each<lb>
other the better for both. I am sure you agree with<lb>
<pb n="106">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-117">

<figdesc>Page 106.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
me?&rdquo; she added, with that covert scrutiny which Christie<lb>
had often felt before.</p>
<p>She could but acquiesce in the mother's decision, and<lb>
devote herself more faithfully than ever to Helen, who<lb>
soon needed all her care and patience, for a terrible<lb>
unrest grew upon her, bringing sleepless nights again,<lb>
moody days, and all the old afflictions with redoubled<lb>
force.</p>
<p>Bella &ldquo;came out&rdquo; and began her career as a beauty<lb>
and a belle most brilliantly. Harry was proud of her,<lb>
but seemed jealous of other men's admiration for his<lb>
charming sister, and would excite both Helen and himself<lb>
over the flirtations into which &ldquo;that child&rdquo; as they<lb>
called her, plunged with all the zest of a light-hearted<lb>
girl whose head was a little turned with sudden and<lb>
excessive adoration.</p>
<p>In vain Christie begged Harry not to report these<lb>
things, in vain she hinted that Bella had better not<lb>
come to show herself to Helen night after night in all<lb>
the dainty splendor of her youth and beauty; in vain<lb>
she asked Mrs. Carrol to let her go away to some<lb>
quieter place with Helen, since she never could be persuaded<lb>
to join in any gayety at home or abroad. All<lb>
seemed wilful, blind, or governed by the fear of the<lb>
gossiping world. So the days rolled on till an event<lb>
occurred which enlightened Christie, with startling<lb>
abruptness, and showed her the skeleton that haunted<lb>
this unhappy family.</p>
<p>Going in one morning to Helen she found her walking<lb>
to and fro as she often walked of late, with hurried<lb>
steps and excited face as if driven by some power<lb>
beyond her control.</p>
<pb n="107">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-118">

<figdesc>Page 107.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, dear. I 'm so sorry you had a restless<lb>
night, and wish you had sent for me. Will you<lb>
come out now for an early drive? It 's a lovely day,<lb>
and your mother thinks it would do you good,&rdquo; began<lb>
Christie, troubled by the state in which she found the<lb>
girl.</p>
<p>But as she spoke Helen turned on her, crying passionately:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother! don't speak of her to me, I hate her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, don't say that. Forgive and forget if<lb>
she has displeased you, and don't exhaust yourself by<lb>
brooding over it. Come, dear, and let us soothe ourselves<lb>
with a little music. I want to hear that new<lb>
song again, though I can never hope to sing it as you<lb>
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing!&rdquo; echoed Helen, with a shrill laugh, &ldquo;you<lb>
don't know what you ask. Could <hi rend="italics">you</hi> sing when your<lb>
heart was heavy with the knowledge of a sin about to<lb>
be committed by those nearest to you? Don't try to<lb>
quiet me, I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> talk whether you listen or not; I shall<lb>
go frantic if I don't tell some one; all the world will<lb>
know it soon. Sit down, I 'll not hurt you, but don't<lb>
thwart me or you 'll be sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking with a vehemence that left her breathless,<lb>
Helen thrust Christie down upon a seat, and went on<lb>
with an expression in her face that bereft the listener<lb>
of power to move or speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry has just told me of it; he was very angry,<lb>
and I saw it, and made him tell me. Poor boy, he can<lb>
keep nothing from <hi rend="italics">me.</hi> I 've been dreading it, and<lb>
now it 's coming. You don't know it, then? Young<lb>
Butler is in love with Bella, and no one has<lb>
<pb n="108">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-119">

<figdesc>Page 108.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
prevented it. Think how wicked when such a curse is on<lb>
us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question, &ldquo;What curse?&rdquo; rose involuntarily to<lb>
Christie's lips, but did not pass them, for, as if she read<lb>
the thought, Helen answered it in a whisper that made<lb>
the blood tingle in the other's veins, so full of ominous<lb>
suggestion was it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The curse of insanity I mean. We are all mad, or<lb>
shall be; we come of a mad race, and for years we<lb>
have gone recklessly on bequeathing this awful inheritance<lb>
to our descendants. It should end with us, we<lb>
are the last; none of us should marry; none dare think<lb>
of it but Bella, and she knows nothing. She must be<lb>
told, she must be kept from the sin of deceiving her<lb>
lover, the agony of seeing her children become what I<lb>
am, and what we all may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Helen wrung her hands and paced the room in<lb>
such a paroxysm of impotent despair that Christie sat<lb>
bewildered and aghast, wondering if this were true, or<lb>
but the fancy of a troubled brain. Mrs. Carrol's face<lb>
and manner returned to her with sudden vividness, so<lb>
did Augustine's gloomy expression, and the strange<lb>
wish uttered over his sleeping sister long ago. Harry's<lb>
reckless, aimless life might be explained in this way;<lb>
and all that had perplexed her through that year.<lb>
Every thing confirmed the belief that this tragical<lb>
assertion was true, and Christie covered up her face,<lb>
murmuring, with an involuntary shiver:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, how terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen came and stood before her with such grief and<lb>
penitence in her countenance that for a moment it conquered<lb>
the despair that had broken bounds.</p>
<pb n="109">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-120">

<figdesc>Page 109.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have told you this at first; I longed to<lb>
do it, but I was afraid you 'd go and leave me. I was<lb>
so lonely, so miserable, Christie. I could not give you<lb>
up when I had learned to love you; and I did learn<lb>
very soon, for no wretched creature ever needed help<lb>
and comfort more than I. For your sake I tried to be<lb>
quiet, to control my shattered nerves, and hide my<lb>
desperate thoughts. You helped me very much, and<lb>
your unconsciousness made me doubly watchful. Forgive<lb>
me; don't desert me now, for the old horror may<lb>
be coming back, and I want you more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too much moved to speak, Christie held out her<lb>
hands, with a face full of pity, love, and grief. Poor<lb>
Helen clung to them as if her only help lay there, and<lb>
for a moment was quite still. But not long; the old<lb>
anguish was too sharp to be borne in silence; the relief<lb>
of confidence once tasted was too great to be denied;<lb>
and, breaking loose, she went to and fro again, pouring<lb>
out the bitter secret which had been weighing upon<lb>
heart and conscience for a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wonder that I hate my mother; let me tell<lb>
you why. When she was beautiful and young she<lb>
married, knowing the sad history of my father's family.<lb>
He was rich, she poor and proud; ambition made her<lb>
wicked, and she did it after being warned that, though<lb>
he might escape, his children were sure to inherit the<lb>
curse, for when one generation goes free it falls more<lb>
heavily upon the rest. She knew it all, and yet she<lb>
married him. I have her to thank for all I suffer, and<lb>
I cannot love her though she is my mother. It may be<lb>
wrong to say these things, but they are true; they<lb>
burn in my heart, and I must speak out; for I tell you<lb>
<pb n="110">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-121">

<figdesc>Page 110.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
there comes a time when children judge their parents<lb>
as men and women, in spite of filial duty, and woe to<lb>
those whose actions change affection and respect to<lb>
hatred or contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bitter grief, the solemn fervor of her words, both<lb>
touched and awed Christie too much for speech. Helen<lb>
had passed beyond the bounds of ceremony, fear, or<lb>
shame: her hard lot, her dark experience, set her apart,<lb>
and gave her the right to utter the bare truth. To<lb>
her heart's core Christie felt that warning; and for the<lb>
first time saw what many never see or wilfully deny, &mdash;<lb>
the awful responsibility that lies on every man and<lb>
woman's soul forbidding them to entail upon the innocent<lb>
the burden of their own infirmities, the curse that<lb>
surely follows their own sins.</p>
<p>Sad and stern, as an accusing angel, that most unhappy<lb>
daughter spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever a woman had cause to repent, it is my<lb>
mother; but she will not, and till she does, God has<lb>
forsaken us. Nothing can subdue her pride, not even<lb>
an affliction like mine. She hides the truth; she hides<lb>
me, and lets the world believe I am dying of consumption;<lb>
not a word about insanity, and no one knows the<lb>
secret beyond ourselves, but doctor, nurse, and you.<lb>
This is why I was not sent away, but for a year was<lb>
shut up in that room yonder where the door is always<lb>
locked. If you look in, you 'll see barred windows,<lb>
guarded fire, muffled walls, and other sights to chill<lb>
your blood, when you remember all those dreadful<lb>
things were meant for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't speak, don't think of them! Don't talk any<lb>
more; let me do something to comfort you, for my<lb>
<pb n="111">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-122">

<figdesc>Page 111.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
heart is broken with all this,&rdquo; cried Christie, panic-stricken<lb>
at the picture Helen's words had conjured up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> go on! There is no rest for me till I have<lb>
tried to lighten this burden by sharing it with you.<lb>
Let me talk, let me wear myself out, then you shall<lb>
help and comfort me, if there is any help and comfort<lb>
for such as I. Now I can tell you all about my Edward,<lb>
and you 'll listen, though mamma forbade it. Three<lb>
years ago my father died, and we came here. I was<lb>
well then, and oh, how happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clasping her hands above her head, she stood like a<lb>
beautiful, pale image of despair; tearless and mute, but<lb>
with such a world of anguish in the eyes lifted to the<lb>
smiling picture opposite that it needed no words to tell<lb>
the story of a broken heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I loved him!&rdquo; she said, softly, while her whole<lb>
face glowed for an instant with the light and warmth<lb>
of a deathless passion. &ldquo;How I loved him, and how<lb>
he loved me! Too well to let me darken both our<lb>
lives with a remorse which would come too late for a<lb>
just atonement. I thought him cruel then, &mdash; I bless<lb>
him for it now. I had far rather be the innocent sufferer<lb>
I am, than a wretched woman like my mother. I<lb>
shall never see him any more, but I know he thinks of<lb>
me far away in India, and when I die one faithful heart<lb>
will remember me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There her voice faltered and failed, and for a moment<lb>
the fire of her eyes was quenched in tears. Christie<lb>
thought the reaction had come, and rose to go and comfort<lb>
her. But instantly Helen's hand was on her shoulder,<lb>
and pressing her back into her seat, she said, almost<lb>
fiercely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'm not done yet; you must hear the whole, and<lb>
help me to save Bella. We knew nothing of the blight<lb>
that hung over us till father told Augustine upon his<lb>
death-bed. August, urged by mother, kept it to himself,<lb>
and went away to bear it as he could. He should<lb>
have spoken out and saved me in time. But not till<lb>
he came home and found me engaged did he have<lb>
courage to warn me of the fate in store for us. So<lb>
Edward tore himself away, although it broke his heart,<lb>
and I &mdash; do you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick gesture she rent open her dress, and<lb>
on her bosom Christie saw a scar that made her turn<lb>
yet paler than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I tried to kill myself; but they would not let<lb>
me die, so the old tragedy of our house begins again.<lb>
August became a priest, hoping to hide his calamity<lb>
and expiate his father's sin by endless penances and<lb>
prayers. Harry turned reckless; for what had he to<lb>
look forward to? A short life, and a gay one, he says,<lb>
and when his turn comes he will spare himself long<lb>
suffering, as I tried to do it. Bella was never told;<lb>
she was so young they kept her ignorant of all they<lb>
could, even the knowledge of my state. She was long<lb>
away at school, but now she has come home, now she<lb>
has learned to love, and is going blindly as I went,<lb>
because no one tells her what she <hi rend="italics">must</hi> know soon or<lb>
late. Mamma will not. August hesitates, remembering<lb>
me. Harry swears he will speak out, but I implore<lb>
him not to do it, for he will be too violent; and I am<lb>
powerless. I never knew about this man till Hal told<lb>
me to-day. Bella only comes in for a moment, and I<lb>
have no chance to tell her she must <hi rend="italics">not</hi> love him.&rdquo;</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="H">
<p>Pressing her hands to her temples, Helen resumed<lb>
her restless march again, but suddenly broke out more<lb>
violently than before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do you wonder why I am half frantic? Now<lb>
will you ask me to sing and smile, and sit calmly by<lb>
while this wrong goes on? You have done much for<lb>
me, and God will bless you for it, but you cannot keep<lb>
me sane. Death is the only cure for a mad Carrol, and<lb>
I 'm so young, so strong, it will be long in coming<lb>
unless I hurry it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clenched her hands, set her teeth, and looked<lb>
about her as if ready for any desperate act that should<lb>
set her free from the dark and dreadful future that lay<lb>
before her.</p>
<p>For a moment Christie feared and trembled; then<lb>
pity conquered fear. She forgot herself, and only<lb>
remembered this poor girl, so hopeless, helpless, and<lb>
afflicted. Led by a sudden impulse, she put both arms<lb>
about her, and held her close with a strong but silent<lb>
tenderness better than any bonds. At first, Helen<lb>
seemed unconscious of it, as she stood rigid and motionless,<lb>
with her wild eyes dumbly imploring help of earth<lb>
and heaven. Suddenly both strength and excitement<lb>
seemed to leave her, and she would have fallen but for<lb>
the living, loving prop that sustained her.</p>
<p>Still silent, Christie laid her down, kissed her white<lb>
lips, and busied herself about her till she looked up<lb>
quite herself again, but so wan and weak, it was pitiful<lb>
to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's over now,&rdquo; she whispered, with a desolate sigh.<lb>
&ldquo;Sing to me, and keep the evil spirit quiet for a little<lb>
<pb n="114">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-125">

<figdesc>Page 114.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
while. To-morrow, if I 'm strong enough, we 'll talk<lb>
about poor little Bella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Christie sang, with tears dropping fast upon the<lb>
keys, that made a soft accompaniment to the sweet old<lb>
hymns which soothed this troubled soul as David's<lb>
music brought repose to Saul.</p>
<p>When Helen slept at last from sheer exhaustion,<lb>
Christie executed the resolution she had made as soon<lb>
as the excitement of that stormy scene was over. She<lb>
went straight to Mrs. Carrol's room, and, undeterred<lb>
by the presence of her sons, told all that had passed.<lb>
They were evidently not unprepared for it, thanks to<lb>
old Hester, who had overheard enough of Helen's<lb>
wild words to know that something was amiss, and<lb>
had reported accordingly; but none of them had ventured<lb>
to interrupt the interview, lest Helen should be<lb>
driven to desperation as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, Helen is right; we should speak out, and<lb>
not hide this bitter fact any longer. The world will<lb>
pity us, and we must bear the pity, but it would condemn<lb>
us for deceit, and we should deserve the condemnation<lb>
if we let this misery go on. Living a lie will<lb>
ruin us all. Bella will be destroyed as Helen was; I<lb>
am only the shadow of a man now, and Hal is killing<lb>
himself as fast as he can, to avoid the fate we all dread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Augustine spoke first, for Mrs. Carrol sat speechless<lb>
with her trouble as Christie paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep to your prayers, and let me go my own way,<lb>
it 's the shortest,&rdquo; muttered Harry, with his face hidden,<lb>
and his head down on his folded arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, boys, you 'll kill me if you say such things!<lb>
I have more now than I can bear. Don't drive me<lb>
<pb n="115">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-126">

</eaffig>
wild with your reproaches to each other!&rdquo; cried their<lb>
mother, her heart rent with the remorse that came too<lb>
late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that; <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are not a Carrol,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Harry, with the pitiless bluntness of a resentful and<lb>
rebellious boy.</p>
<p>Augustine turned on him with a wrathful flash of the<lb>
eye, and a warning ring in his stern voice, as he pointed<lb>
to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not insult your mother! Ask her pardon,<lb>
or go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should ask mine! I 'll go. When you want<lb>
me, you 'll know where to find me.&rdquo; And, with a reckless<lb>
laugh, Harry stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>Augustine's indignant face grew full of a new trouble<lb>
as the door banged below, and he pressed his thin<lb>
hands tightly together, saying, as if to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help me! Yes, I do know; for, night after<lb>
night, I find and bring the poor lad home from gambling-tables<lb>
and the hells where souls like his are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Christie thought to slip away, feeling that it<lb>
was no place for her now that her errand was done.<lb>
But Mrs. Carrol called her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Devon &mdash; Christie &mdash; forgive me that I did not<lb>
trust you sooner. It was so hard to tell; I hoped so<lb>
much from time; I never could believe that my poor<lb>
children would be made the victims of my mistake.<lb>
Do not forsake us: Helen loves you so. Stay with her,<lb>
I implore you, and let a most unhappy mother plead<lb>
for a most unhappy child.&rdquo; Then Christie went to the<lb>
poor woman, and earnestly assured her of her love and<lb>
loyalty; for now she felt doubly bound to them because<lb>
they trusted her.</p>
<pb n="116">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-127">

<figdesc>Page 116.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; they said to her, with pathetic<lb>
submission, turning like sick people to a healthful soul<lb>
for help and comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Bella all the truth, and help her to refuse her<lb>
lover. Do this just thing, and God will strengthen<lb>
you to bear the consequences,&rdquo; was her answer, though<lb>
she trembled at the responsibility they put upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Carrol. &ldquo;Let the poor child<lb>
enjoy the holidays with a light heart, &mdash; then we will<lb>
tell her; and then Heaven help us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided; for only a week or two of the old<lb>
year remained, and no one had the heart to rob poor<lb>
Bella of the little span of blissful ignorance that now<lb>
remained to her.</p>
<p>A terrible time was that to Christie; for, while one<lb>
sister, blessed with beauty, youth, love, and pleasure,<lb>
tasted life at its sweetest, the other sat in the black<lb>
shadow of a growing dread, and wearied Heaven with<lb>
piteous prayers for her relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old horror is coming back; I feel it creeping<lb>
over me. Don't let it come, Christie! Stay by me!<lb>
Help me! Keep me sane! And if you cannot, ask<lb>
God to take me quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With words like these, poor Helen clung to Christie;<lb>
and, soul and body, Christie devoted herself to the<lb>
afflicted girl. She would not see her mother; and the<lb>
unhappy woman haunted that closed door, hungering<lb>
for the look, the word, that never came to her. Augustine<lb>
was her consolation, and, during those troublous<lb>
days, the priest was forgotten in the son. But Harry<lb>
was all in all to Helen then; and it was touching to<lb>
see how these unfortunate young creatures clung to one<lb>
<pb n="117">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-128">

<figdesc>Page 117.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
another, she tenderly trying to keep him from the wild<lb>
life that was surely hastening the fate he might otherwise<lb>
escape for years, and he patiently bearing all her<lb>
moods, eager to cheer and soothe the sad captivity from<lb>
which he could not save her.</p>
<p>These tender ministrations seemed to be blessed at<lb>
last; and Christie began to hope the haunting terror<lb>
would pass by, as quiet gloom succeeded to wild excitement.<lb>
The cheerful spirit of the season seemed to<lb>
reach even that sad room; and, in preparing gifts for<lb>
others, Helen seemed to find a little of that best of all<lb>
gifts, &mdash; peace for herself.</p>
<p>On New Year's morning, Christie found her garlanding<lb>
her lover's picture with white roses and the myrtle<lb>
sprays brides wear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were his favorite flowers, and I meant to<lb>
make my wedding wreath of this sweet-scented myrtle,<lb>
because he gave it to me,&rdquo; she said, with a look that<lb>
made Christie's eyes grow dim. &ldquo;Don't grieve for me,<lb>
dear; we shall surely meet hereafter, though so far<lb>
asunder here. Nothing can part us there, I devoutly<lb>
believe; for we leave our burdens all behind us when<lb>
we go.&rdquo; Then, in a lighter tone, she said, with her arm<lb>
on Christie's neck:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day is to be a happy one, no matter what<lb>
comes after it. I 'm going to be my old self for a little<lb>
while, and forget there's such a word as sorrow. Help<lb>
me to dress, so that when the boys come up they may<lb>
find the sister Nell they have not seen for two long<lb>
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you wear this, my darling? Your mother<lb>
sends it, and she tried to have it dainty and beautiful<lb>
<pb n="118">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-129">

<figdesc>Page 118.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enough to please you. See, your own colors, though<lb>
the bows are only laid on that they may be changed<lb>
for others if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke Christie lifted the cover of the box old<lb>
Hester had just brought in, and displayed a cashmere<lb>
wrapper, creamy-white, silk-lined, down-trimmed, and<lb>
delicately relieved by rosy knots, like holly berries lying<lb>
upon snow. Helen looked at it without a word for<lb>
several minutes, then gathering up the ribbons, with a<lb>
strange smile, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it better so; but I 'll not wear it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless and save us, deary; it <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have a bit of<lb>
color somewhere, else it looks just like a shroud,&rdquo; cried<lb>
Hester, and then wrung her hands in dismay as Helen<lb>
answered, quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, keep it for me, then. I shall be happier<lb>
when I wear it so than in the gayest gown I own, for<lb>
when you put it on, this poor head and heart of mine<lb>
will be quiet at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motioning Hester to remove the box, Christie tried<lb>
to banish the cloud her unlucky words had brought to<lb>
Helen's face, by chatting cheerfully as she helped her<lb>
make herself &ldquo;pretty for the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that day she was unusually calm and sweet, and<lb>
seemed to yield herself wholly to the happy influences<lb>
of the hour, gave and received her gifts so cheerfully<lb>
that her brothers watched her with delight; and unconscious<lb>
Bella said, as she hung about her sister, with<lb>
loving admiration in her eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought you would get well, and now I 'm<lb>
sure of it, for you look as you used before I went away<lb>
to school, and seem just like our own dear Nell.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="119">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-130">

<figdesc>Page 119.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm glad of that; I wanted you to feel so, my<lb>
Bella. I 'll accept your happy prophecy, and hope I<lb>
may get well soon, very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So cheerfully she spoke, so tranquilly she smiled,<lb>
that all rejoiced over her believing, with love's blindness,<lb>
that she might yet conquer her malady in spite of<lb>
their forebodings.</p>
<p>It was a very happy day to Christie, not only that<lb>
she was generously remembered and made one of them<lb>
by all the family, but because this change for the better<lb>
in Helen made her heart sing for joy. She had given<lb>
time, health, and much love to the task, and ventured<lb>
now to hope they had not been given in vain. One<lb>
thing only marred her happiness, the sad estrangement<lb>
of the daughter from her mother, and that evening she<lb>
resolved to take advantage of Helen's tender mood,<lb>
and plead for the poor soul who dared not plead for<lb>
herself.</p>
<p>As the brothers and sisters said good-night, Helen<lb>
clung to them as if loth to part, saying, with each<lb>
embrace:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep hoping for me, Bella; kiss me, Harry; bless<lb>
me, Augustine, and all wish for me a happier New Year<lb>
than the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were gone she wandered slowly round<lb>
the room, stood long before the picture with its fading<lb>
garland, sung a little softly to herself, and came at last<lb>
to Christie, saying, like a tired child:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been good all day; now let me rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing has been forgotten, dear,&rdquo; began Christie,<lb>
fearing to disturb the quietude that seemed to have<lb>
been so dearly bought.</p>
<pb n="120">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-131">

<figdesc>Page 120.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Helen understood her, and looked up with a sane<lb>
sweet face, out of which all resentful bitterness had<lb>
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Christie, not forgotten, only kept until the last.<lb>
To-day is a good day to forgive, as we would be forgiven,<lb>
and I mean to do it before I sleep.&rdquo; Then holding<lb>
Christie close, she added, with a quiver of emotion<lb>
in her voice: &ldquo;I have no words warm enough to thank<lb>
you, my good angel, for all you have been to me, but I<lb>
know it will give you a great pleasure to do one thing<lb>
more. Give dear mamma my love, and tell her that<lb>
when I am quiet for the night I want her to come and<lb>
get me to sleep with the old lullaby she used to sing<lb>
when I was a little child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No gift bestowed that day was so precious to Christie<lb>
as the joy of carrying this loving message from daughter<lb>
to mother. How Mrs. Carrol received it need not<lb>
be told. She would have gone at once, but Christie<lb>
begged her to wait till rest and quiet, after the efforts<lb>
of the day, had prepared Helen for an interview which<lb>
might undo all that had been done if too hastily attempted.<lb>
</p>
<p>Hester always waited upon her child at night; so,<lb>
feeling that she might be wanted later, Christie went<lb>
to her own room to rest. Quite sure that Mrs. Carrol<lb>
would come to tell her what had passed, she waited for<lb>
an hour or two, then went to ask of Hester how the<lb>
visit had sped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mamma came up long ago, but the dear thing<lb>
was fast asleep, so I wouldn't let her be disturbed, and<lb>
Mrs. Carrol went away again,&rdquo; said the old woman,<lb>
rousing from a nap.</p>
<pb n="121">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-132">

<figdesc>Page 121.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="6">
<p>Grieved at the mother's disappointment, Christie<lb>
stole in, hoping that Helen might rouse. She did not,<lb>
and Christie was about to leave her, when, as she bent<lb>
to smooth the tumbled coverlet, something dropped<lb>
at her feet. Only a little pearl-handled penknife of<lb>
Harry's; but her heart stood still with fear, for it was<lb>
open, and, as she took it up, a red stain came off upon<lb>
her hand.</p>
<p>Helen's face was turned away, and, bending nearer,<lb>
Christie saw how deathly pale it looked in the shadow<lb>
of the darkened room. She listened at her lips; only<lb>
a faint flutter of breath parted them; she lifted up the<lb>
averted head, and on the white throat saw a little<lb>
wound, from which the blood still flowed. Then, like<lb>
a flash of light, the meaning of the sudden change<lb>
which came over her grew clear, &mdash; her brave efforts to<lb>
make the last day happy, her tender good-night partings,<lb>
her wish to be at peace with every one, the tragic<lb>
death she had chosen rather than live out the tragic<lb>
life that lay before her.</p>
<p>Christie's nerves had been tried to the uttermost;<lb>
the shock of this discovery was too much for her, and,<lb>
in the act of calling for help, she fainted, for the first<lb>
time in her life.</p>
<p>When she was herself again, the room was full of<lb>
people; terror-stricken faces passed before her; broken<lb>
voices whispered, &ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; and, as she saw the<lb>
group about the bed, she wished for unconsciousness<lb>
again.</p>
<p>Helen lay in her mother's arms at last, quietly breathing<lb>
her life away, for though every thing that love and<lb>
skill could devise had been tried to save her, the little<lb>
<pb n="122">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-133">

<figdesc>Page 122.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
knife in that desperate hand had done its work, and<lb>
this world held no more suffering for her. Harry was<lb>
down upon his knees beside her, trying to stifle his<lb>
passionate grief. Augustine prayed audibly above her,<lb>
and the fervor of his broken words comforted all hearts<lb>
but one. Bella was clinging, panic-stricken, to the<lb>
kind old doctor, who was sobbing like a boy, for he had<lb>
loved and served poor Helen as faithfully as if she had<lb>
been his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can nothing save her?&rdquo; Christie whispered, as the<lb>
prayer ended, and a sound of bitter weeping filled the<lb>
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; she is sane and safe at last, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie could not but echo his thanksgiving, for the<lb>
blessed tranquillity of the girl's countenance was such<lb>
as none but death, the great healer, can bring; and, as<lb>
they looked, her eyes opened, beautifully clear and<lb>
calm before they closed for ever. From face to face<lb>
they passed, as if they looked for some one, and her<lb>
lips moved in vain efforts to speak.</p>
<p>Christie went to her, but still the wide, wistful eyes<lb>
searched the room as if unsatisfied; and, with a longing<lb>
that conquered the mortal weakness of the body, the<lb>
heart sent forth one tender cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother &mdash; I want my mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no need to repeat the piteous call, for, as<lb>
it left her lips, she saw her mother's face bending over<lb>
her, and felt her mother's arms gathering her in an<lb>
embrace which held her close even after death had set<lb>
its seal upon the voiceless prayers for pardon which<lb>
passed between those reunited hearts.</p>
<p>When she was asleep at last, Christie and her mother<lb>
<pb n="123">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-134">

<figdesc>Page 123.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
made her ready for her grave; weeping tender tears as<lb>
they folded her in the soft, white garment she had put<lb>
by for that sad hour; and on her breast they laid the<lb>
flowers she had hung about her lover as a farewell gift.<lb>
So beautiful she looked when all was done, that in the<lb>
early dawn they called her brothers, that they might<lb>
not lose the memory of the blessed peace that shone<lb>
upon her face, a mute assurance that for her the new<lb>
year had happily begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my work here is done, and I must go,&rdquo; thought<lb>
Christie, when the waves of life closed over the spot<lb>
where another tired swimmer had gone down. But<lb>
she found that one more task remained for her before<lb>
she left the family which, on her coming, she had<lb>
thought so happy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carrol, worn out with the long effort to conceal<lb>
her secret cross, broke down entirely under this last<lb>
blow, and besought Christie to tell Bella all that she<lb>
must know. It was a hard task, but Christie accepted<lb>
it, and, when the time came, found that there was very<lb>
little to be told, for at the death-bed of the elder sister,<lb>
the younger had learned much of the sad truth. Thus<lb>
prepared, she listened to all that was most carefully and<lb>
tenderly confided to her, and, when the heavy tale was<lb>
done, she surprised Christie by the unsuspected strength<lb>
she showed. No tears, no lamentations, for she was<lb>
her mother's daughter, and inherited the pride that can<lb>
bear heavy burdens, if they are borne unseen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what I must do, and I will do it,&rdquo; she said,<lb>
with the quiet despair of one who submits to the inevitable,<lb>
but will not complain.</p>
<p>When Christie with difficulty told her that she should<lb>
<pb n="124">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-135">

<figdesc>Page 124.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
give up her lover, Bella bowed her head, and for a<lb>
moment could not speak, then lifted it as if defying her<lb>
own weakness, and spoke out bravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done, for it is right. It is very hard for<lb>
<hi rend="italics">me,</hi> because I love him; he will not suffer much, for he<lb>
can love again. I should be glad of that, and I 'll try<lb>
to wish it for his sake. He is young, and if, as Harry<lb>
says, he cares more for my fortune than myself, so much<lb>
the better. What next, Christie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazed and touched at the courage of the creature<lb>
she had fancied a sort of lovely butterfly to be crushed<lb>
by a single blow, Christie took heart, and, instead of<lb>
soothing sympathy, gave her the solace best fitted for<lb>
strong natures, something to do for others. What<lb>
inspired her, Christie never knew; perhaps it was the<lb>
year of self-denying service she had rendered for pity's<lb>
sake; such devotion is its own reward, and now, in<lb>
herself, she discovered unsuspected powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live for your mother and your brothers, Bella;<lb>
they need you sorely, and in time I know you will find<lb>
true consolation in it, although you must relinquish<lb>
much. Sustain your mother, cheer Augustine, watch<lb>
over Harry, and be to them what Helen longed to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fail to do it, as she failed!&rdquo; cried Bella, with a<lb>
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, and let me give you this hope, for I sincerely<lb>
do believe it. Since I came here, I have read<lb>
many books, thought much, and talked often with Dr.<lb>
Shirley about this sad affliction. He thinks you and<lb>
Harry may escape it, if you will. You are like your<lb>
mother in temperament and temper; you have self-control,<lb>
strong wills, good nerves, and cheerful spirits.<lb>
<pb n="125">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-136">

<figdesc>Page 125.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Poor Harry is willfully spoiling all his chances now;<lb>
but you may save him, and, in the endeavor, save yourself.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Christie, may I hope it? Give me one chance<lb>
of escape, and I will suffer any hardship to keep it.<lb>
Let me see any thing before me but a life and death like<lb>
Helen's, and I 'll bless you for ever!&rdquo; cried Bella, welcoming<lb>
this ray of light as a prisoner welcomes sunshine<lb>
in his cell.</p>
<p>Christie trembled at the power of her words, yet,<lb>
honestly believing them, she let them uplift this disconsolate<lb>
soul, trusting that they might be in time fulfilled<lb>
through God's mercy and the saving grace of sincere<lb>
endeavor.</p>
<p>Holding fast to this frail spar, Bella bravely took up<lb>
arms against her sea of troubles, and rode out the<lb>
storm. When her lover came to know his fate, she hid<lb>
her heart, and answered &ldquo;no,&rdquo; finding a bitter satisfaction<lb>
in the end, for Harry was right, and, when the<lb>
fortune was denied him, young Butler did not mourn<lb>
the woman long. Pride helped Bella to bear it; but it<lb>
needed all her courage to look down the coming years<lb>
so bare of all that makes life sweet to youthful souls,<lb>
so desolate and dark, with duty alone to cheer the<lb>
thorny way, and the haunting shadow of her race lurking<lb>
in the background.</p>
<p>Submission and self-sacrifice are stern, sad angels,<lb>
but in time one learns to know and love them, for when<lb>
they have chastened, they uplift and bless. Dimly discerning<lb>
this, poor Bella put her hands in theirs, saying,<lb>
&ldquo;Lead me, teach me; I will follow and obey you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All soon felt that they could not stay in a house so<lb>
<pb n="126">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-137">

<figdesc>Page 126.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
full of heavy memories, and decided to return to their<lb>
old home. They begged Christie to go with them,<lb>
using every argument and entreaty their affection could<lb>
suggest. But Christie needed rest, longed for freedom,<lb>
and felt that in spite of their regard it would be very<lb>
hard for her to live among them any longer. Her<lb>
healthy nature needed brighter influences, stronger<lb>
comrades, and the memory of Helen weighed so heavily<lb>
upon her heart that she was eager to forget it for a time<lb>
in other scenes and other work.</p>
<p>So they parted, very sadly, very tenderly, and laden<lb>
with good gifts Christie went on her way weary, but<lb>
well satisfied, for she had earned her rest.</p>

</p>
<p>FOR some weeks Christie rested and refreshed herself<lb>
by making her room gay and comfortable<lb>
with the gifts lavished on her by the Carrols, and<lb>
by sharing with others the money which Harry had<lb>
smuggled into her possession after she had steadily<lb>
refused to take one penny more than the sum agreed<lb>
upon when she first went to them.</p>
<p>She took infinite satisfaction in sending one hundred<lb>
dollars to Uncle Enos, for she had accepted what he<lb>
gave her as a loan, and set her heart on repaying every<lb>
fraction of it. Another hundred she gave to Hepsey,<lb>
who found her out and came to report her trials and<lb>
tribulations. The good soul had ventured South and<lb>
tried to buy her mother. But &ldquo;ole missis&rdquo; would not<lb>
let her go at any price, and the faithful chattel would<lb>
not run away. Sorely disappointed, Hepsey had been<lb>
obliged to submit; but her trip was not a failure, for<lb>
she liberated several brothers and sent them triumphantly<lb>
to Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <hi rend="italics">must</hi> take it, Hepsey, for I could not rest<lb>
happy if I put it away to lie idle while you can save<lb>
men and women from torment with it. I 'd give it if<lb>
<pb n="128">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-139">

<figdesc>Page 128.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
it was my last penny, for I can help in no other way;<lb>
and if I need money, I can always earn it, thank God!&rdquo;<lb>
said Christie, as Hepsey hesitated to take so much from<lb>
a fellow-worker.</p>
<p>The thought of that investment lay warm at Christie's<lb>
heart, and never woke a regret, for well she knew<lb>
that every dollar of it would be blessed, since shares in<lb>
the Underground Railroad pay splendid dividends that<lb>
never fail.</p>
<p>Another portion of her fortune, as she called Harry's<lb>
gift, was bestowed in wedding presents upon Lucy,<lb>
who at length succeeded in winning the heart of the<lb>
owner of the &ldquo;heavenly eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;distracting legs;&rdquo;<lb>
and, having gained her point, married him with dramatic<lb>
celerity, and went West to follow the fortunes<lb>
of her lord.</p>
<p>The old theatre was to be demolished and the company<lb>
scattered, so a farewell festival was held, and<lb>
Christie went to it, feeling more solitary than ever as<lb>
she bade her old friends a long good-bye.</p>
<p>The rest of the money burned in her pocket, but she<lb>
prudently put it by for a rainy day, and fell to work<lb>
again when her brief vacation was over.</p>
<p>Hearing of a chance for a good needle-woman in a<lb>
large and well-conducted mantua-making establishment,<lb>
she secured it as a temporary thing, for she<lb>
wanted to divert her mind from that last sad experience<lb>
by entirely different employment and surroundings.<lb>
She liked to return at night to her own little<lb>
home, solitary and simple as it was, and felt a great<lb>
repugnance to accept any place where she would be<lb>
mixed up with family affairs again.</p>

</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="6* I">
<p>So day after day she went to her seat in the work-room<lb>
where a dozen other young women sat sewing<lb>
busily on gay garments, with as much lively gossip to<lb>
beguile the time as Miss Cotton, the forewoman, would<lb>
allow.</p>
<p>For a while it diverted Christie, as she had a feminine<lb>
love for pretty things, and enjoyed seeing delicate<lb>
silks, costly lace, and all the indescribable fantasies of<lb>
fashion. But as spring came on, the old desire for<lb>
something fresh and free began to haunt her, and she<lb>
had both waking and sleeping dreams of a home in the<lb>
country somewhere, with cows and flowers, clothes<lb>
bleaching on green grass, bob-o'-links making rapturous<lb>
music by the river, and the smell of new-mown hay, all<lb>
lending their charms to the picture she painted for<lb>
herself.</p>
<p>Most assuredly she would have gone to find these<lb>
things, led by the instincts of a healthful nature, had<lb>
not one slender tie held her till it grew into a bond so<lb>
strong she could not break it.</p>
<p>Among her companions was one, and one only, who<lb>
attracted her. The others were well-meaning girls,<lb>
but full of the frivolous purposes and pleasures which<lb>
their tastes prompted and their dull life fostered. Dress,<lb>
gossip, and wages were the three topics which absorbed<lb>
them. Christie soon tired of the innumerable changes<lb>
rung upon these themes, and took refuge in her own<lb>
thoughts, soon learning to enjoy them undisturbed by<lb>
the clack of many tongues about her. Her evenings<lb>
at home were devoted to books, for she had the true<lb>
New England woman's desire for education, and read<lb>
or studied for the love of it. Thus she had much to<lb>
<pb n="130">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-141">

<figdesc>Page 130.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
think of as her needle flew, and was rapidly becoming<lb>
a sort of sewing-machine when life was brightened for<lb>
her by the finding of a friend.</p>
<p>Among the girls was one quiet, skilful creature,<lb>
whose black dress, peculiar face, and silent ways<lb>
attracted Christie. Her evident desire to be let alone<lb>
amused the new comer at first, and she made no effort<lb>
to know her. But presently she became aware that<lb>
Rachel watched her with covert interest, stealing quick,<lb>
shy glances at her as she sat musing over her work.<lb>
Christie smiled at her when she caught these glances,<lb>
as if to reassure the looker of her good-will. But<lb>
Rachel only colored, kept her eyes fixed on her work,<lb>
and was more reserved than ever.</p>
<p>This interested Christie, and she fell to studying this<lb>
young woman with some curiosity, for she was different<lb>
from the others. Though evidently younger than she<lb>
looked, Rachel's face was that of one who had known<lb>
some great sorrow, some deep experience; for there<lb>
were lines on the forehead that contrasted strongly<lb>
with the bright, abundant hair above it; in repose, the<lb>
youthfully red, soft lips had a mournful droop, and the<lb>
eyes were old with that indescribable expression which<lb>
comes to those who count their lives by emotions, not<lb>
by years.</p>
<p>Strangely haunting eyes to Christie, for they seemed<lb>
to appeal to her with a mute eloquence she could not<lb>
resist. In vain did Rachel answer her with quiet coldness,<lb>
nod silently when she wished her a cheery &ldquo;good<lb>
morning,&rdquo; and keep resolutely in her own somewhat<lb>
isolated corner, though invited to share the sunny<lb>
window where the other sat. Her eyes belied her<lb>
<pb n="131">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-142">

<figdesc>Page 131.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
words, and those fugitive glances betrayed the longing<lb>
of a lonely heart that dared not yield itself to the<lb>
genial companionship so freely offered it.</p>
<p>Christie was sure of this, and would not be repulsed;<lb>
for her own heart was very solitary. She missed Helen,<lb>
and longed to fill the empty place. She wooed this<lb>
shy, cold girl as patiently and as gently as a lover<lb>
might, determined to win her confidence, because all<lb>
the others had failed to do it. Sometimes she left a<lb>
flower in Rachel's basket, always smiled and nodded as<lb>
she entered, and often stopped to admire the work of<lb>
her tasteful fingers. It was impossible to resist such<lb>
friendly overtures, and slowly Rachel's coldness melted;<lb>
into the beseeching eyes came a look of gratitude, the<lb>
more touching for its wordlessness, and an irrepressible<lb>
smile broke over her face in answer to the cordial ones<lb>
that made the sunshine of her day.</p>
<p>Emboldened by these demonstrations, Christie<lb>
changed her seat, and quietly established between<lb>
them a daily interchange of something beside needles,<lb>
pins, and spools. Then, as Rachel did not draw back<lb>
offended, she went a step farther, and, one day when<lb>
they chanced to be left alone to finish off a delicate bit<lb>
of work, she spoke out frankly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can't we be friends? I want one sadly, and<lb>
so do you, unless your looks deceive me. We both<lb>
seem to be alone in the world, to have had trouble, and<lb>
to like one another. I won't annoy you by any impertinent<lb>
curiosity, nor burden you with uninteresting<lb>
confidences; I only want to feel that you like me a<lb>
little and don't mind my liking you a great deal. Will<lb>
you be my friend, and let me be yours?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="132">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-143">

<figdesc>Page 132.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>A great tear rolled down upon the shining silk in<lb>
Rachel's hands as she looked into Christie's earnest<lb>
face, and answered with an almost passionate gratitude<lb>
in her own:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never need a friend as much as I do, or<lb>
know what a blessed thing it is to find such an one as<lb>
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may love you, and not be afraid of offending?&rdquo;<lb>
cried Christie, much touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But remember <hi rend="italics">I</hi> didn't ask it first,&rdquo; said<lb>
Rachel, half dropping the hand she had held in both<lb>
her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You proud creature! I 'll remember; and when<lb>
we quarrel, I 'll take all the blame upon myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Christie kissed her warmly, whisked away the<lb>
tear, and began to paint the delights in store for them<lb>
in her most enthusiastic way, being much elated with<lb>
her victory; while Rachel listened with a newly kindled<lb>
light in her lovely eyes, and a smile that showed how<lb>
winsome her face had been before many tears washed<lb>
its bloom away, and much trouble made it old too soon.</p>
<p>Christie kept her word, &mdash; asked no questions, volunteered<lb>
no confidences, but heartily enjoyed the new<lb>
friendship, and found that it gave to life the zest which<lb>
it had lacked before. Now some one cared for her,<lb>
and, better still, she could make some one happy, and<lb>
in the act of lavishing the affection of her generous nature<lb>
on a creature sadder and more solitary than herself,<lb>
she found a satisfaction that never lost its charm.<lb>
There was nothing in her possession that she did not<lb>
offer Rachel, from the whole of her heart to the larger<lb>
half of her little room.</p>
<pb n="133">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-144">

<figdesc>Page 133.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm tired of thinking only of myself. It makes me<lb>
selfish and low-spirited; for I 'm not a bit interesting.<lb>
I must love somebody, and `love them hard,' as children<lb>
say; so why can't you come and stay with me?<lb>
There 's room enough, and we could be so cosy evenings<lb>
with our books and work. I know you need some<lb>
one to look after you, and I love dearly to take care<lb>
of people. Do come,&rdquo; she would say, with most persuasive<lb>
hospitality.</p>
<p>But Rachel always answered steadily: &ldquo;Not yet,<lb>
Christie, not yet. I 've got something to do before I<lb>
can think of doing any thing so beautiful as that. Only<lb>
love me, dear, and some day I 'll show you all my heart,<lb>
and thank you as I ought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Christie was content to wait, and, meantime, enjoyed<lb>
much; for, with Rachel as a friend, she ceased<lb>
to care for country pleasures, found happiness in the<lb>
work that gave her better food than mere daily bread,<lb>
and never thought of change; for love can make a<lb>
home for itself anywhere.</p>
<p>A very bright and happy time was this in Christie's<lb>
life; but, like most happy times, it was very brief.<lb>
Only one summer allowed for the blossoming of the<lb>
friendship that budded so slowly in the spring; then<lb>
the frost came and killed the flowers; but the root lived<lb>
long underneath the snows of suffering, doubt, and<lb>
absence.</p>
<p>Coming to her work late one morning, she found the<lb>
usually orderly room in confusion. Some of the girls<lb>
were crying; some whispering together, &mdash; all looking<lb>
excited and dismayed. Mrs. King sat majestically at<lb>
her table, with an ominous frown upon her face. Miss<lb>

<head>Mrs. King and Miss Cotton.</head>
<figdesc>445EAF. Page 136. In-line image of Mrs. King standing over and lecturing a disgruntled Miss
Cotton.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Cotton stood beside her, looking unusually sour and<lb>
stern, for the ancient virgin's temper was not of the<lb>
best. Alone, before them all, with her face hidden in<lb>
her hands, and despair in every line of her drooping<lb>
figure, stood Rachel, &mdash; a meek culprit at the stern bar<lb>
of justice, where women try a sister woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; cried Christie, pausing on the<lb>
threshold.</p>
<pb n="135">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-146">

<figdesc>Page 135.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Rachel shivered, as if the sound of that familiar voice<lb>
was a fresh wound, but she did not lift her head; and<lb>
Mrs. King answered, with a nervous emphasis that<lb>
made the bugles of her head-dress rattle dismally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very sad thing, Miss Devon, &mdash; <hi rend="italics">very</hi> sad, indeed; a<lb>
thing which <hi rend="italics">never</hi> occurred in my establishment before,<lb>
and <hi rend="italics">never</hi> shall again. It appears that Rachel, whom<lb>
we all considered a most respectable and worthy girl,<lb>
has been quite the reverse. I shudder to think what<lb>
the consequences of my taking her without a character<lb>
(a thing I never do, and was only tempted by her superior<lb>
taste as a trimmer) might have been if Miss Cotton,<lb>
having suspicions, had not made strict inquiry and<lb>
confirmed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a kind and generous act, and Miss Cotton<lb>
must feel proud of it,&rdquo; said Christie, with an indignant<lb>
recollection of Mr. Fletcher's &ldquo;cautious inquiries&rdquo; about<lb>
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was perfectly right and proper, Miss Devon; and<lb>
I thank her for her care of my interests.&rdquo; And Mrs.<lb>
King bowed her acknowledgment of the service with<lb>
a perfect castanet accompaniment, whereat Miss Cotton<lb>
bridled with malicious complacency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. King, are you sure of this?&rdquo; said Christie.<lb>
&ldquo;Miss Cotton does not like Rachel because her work is<lb>
so much praised. May not her jealousy make her unjust,<lb>
or her zeal for you mislead her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your polite insinuations, miss,&rdquo; returned<lb>
the irate forewoman. &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> never make mistakes;<lb>
but you will find that <hi rend="italics">you</hi> have made a very great one<lb>
in choosing Rachel for your bosom friend instead of<lb>
some one who would be a credit to you. Ask the<lb>
<pb n="136">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-147">

<figdesc>Page 136.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
creature herself if all I 've said of her isn't true. She can't<lb>
deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the same indefinable misgiving which had held<lb>
her aloof, Christie turned to Rachel, lifted up the hidden<lb>
face with gentle force, and looked into it imploringly,<lb>
as she whispered: &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woful countenance she saw made any other<lb>
answer needless. Involuntarily her hands fell away,<lb>
and she hid her own face, uttering the one reproach,<lb>
which, tender and tearful though it was, seemed harder<lb>
to be borne than the stern condemnation gone before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rachel, I so loved and trusted you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grief, affection, and regret that trembled in her<lb>
voice roused Rachel from her state of passive endurance<lb>
and gave her courage to plead for herself. But it was<lb>
Christie whom she addressed, Christie whose pardon<lb>
she implored, Christie's sorrowful reproach that she<lb>
most keenly felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> true,&rdquo; she said, looking only at the woman<lb>
who had been the first to befriend and now was the last<lb>
to desert her. &ldquo;It is true that I once went astray, but<lb>
God knows I have repented; that for years I 've tried to<lb>
be an honest girl again, and that but for His help I<lb>
should be a far sadder creature than I am this day.<lb>
Christie, you can never know how bitter hard it is to<lb>
outlive a sin like mine, and struggle up again from such<lb>
a fall. It clings to me; it won't be shaken off or buried<lb>
out of sight. No sooner do I find a safe place like this,<lb>
and try to forget the past, than some one reads my<lb>
secret in my face and hunts me down. It seems very<lb>
cruel, very hard, yet it is my punishment, so I try to<lb>
bear it, and begin again. What hurts me now more<lb>
<pb n="137">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-148">

<figdesc>Page 137.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
than all the rest, what breaks my heart, is that I<lb>
deceived <hi rend="italics">you.</hi> I never meant to do it. I did not seek<lb>
you, did I? I tried to be cold and stiff; never asked<lb>
for love, though starving for it, till you came to me, so<lb>
kind, so generous, so dear, &mdash; how could I help it? Oh,<lb>
how could I help it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie had watched Rachel while she spoke, and<lb>
spoke to her alone; her heart yearned toward this one<lb>
friend, for she still loved her, and, loving, she believed<lb>
in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't reproach you, dear: I don't despise or desert<lb>
you, and though I 'm grieved and disappointed, I 'll<lb>
stand by you still, because you need me more than<lb>
ever now, and I want to prove that I am a true friend.<lb>
Mrs. King, please forgive and let poor Rachel stay<lb>
here, safe among us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Devon, I 'm surprised at you! By no means;<lb>
it would be the ruin of my establishment; not a girl<lb>
would remain, and the character of my rooms would<lb>
be lost for ever,&rdquo; replied Mrs. King, goaded on by the<lb>
relentless Cotton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where will she go if you send her away? Who<lb>
will employ her if you inform against her? What<lb>
stranger will believe in her if we, who have known her<lb>
so long, fail to befriend her now? Mrs. King, think<lb>
of your own daughters, and be a mother to this poor<lb>
girl for their sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last stroke touched the woman's heart; her<lb>
cold eye softened, her hard mouth relaxed, and pity<lb>
was about to win the day, when prudence, in the shape<lb>
of Miss Cotton, turned the scale, for that spiteful spinster<lb>
suddenly cried out, in a burst of righteous wrath:</p>
<pb n="138">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-149">

<figdesc>Page 138.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that hussy stays, <hi rend="italics">I</hi> leave this establishment for<lb>
ever!&rdquo; and followed up the blow by putting on her<lb>
bonnet with a flourish.</p>
<p>At this spectacle, self-interest got the better of sympathy<lb>
in Mrs. King's worldly mind. To lose Cotton<lb>
was to lose her right hand, and charity at that price was<lb>
too expensive a luxury to be indulged in; so she<lb>
hardened her heart, composed her features, and said,<lb>
impressively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your bonnet, Cotton; I have no intention<lb>
of offending you, or any one else, by such a step. I<lb>
forgive you, Rachel, and I pity you; but I can't think<lb>
of allowing you to stay. There are proper institutions<lb>
for such as you, and I advise you to go to one and repent.<lb>
You were paid Saturday night, so nothing prevents<lb>
your leaving at once. Time is money here, and<lb>
we are wasting it. Young ladies, take your seats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All but Christie obeyed, yet no one touched a needle,<lb>
and Mrs. King sat, hurriedly stabbing pins into the fat<lb>
cushion on her breast, as if testing the hardness of her<lb>
heart.</p>
<p>Rachel's eye went round the room; saw pity, aversion,<lb>
or contempt, on every face, but met no answering<lb>
glance, for even Christie's eyes were bent thoughtfully<lb>
on the ground, and Christie's heart seemed closed<lb>
against her. As she looked her whole manner changed;<lb>
her tears ceased to fall, her face grew hard, and a reckless<lb>
mood seemed to take possession of her, as if finding<lb>
herself deserted by womankind, she would desert<lb>
her own womanhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known it would be so,&rdquo; she said abruptly,<lb>
with a bitter smile, sadder to see than her most<lb>
<pb n="139">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-150">

<figdesc>Page 139.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hopeless tears. &ldquo;It 's no use for such as me to try; better<lb>
go back to the old life, for there are kinder hearts<lb>
among the sinners than among the saints, and no one<lb>
can live without a bit of love. Your Magdalen Asylums<lb>
are penitentiaries, not homes; I won't go to any of<lb>
them. Your piety isn't worth much, for though you<lb>
read in your Bible how the Lord treated a poor soul<lb>
like me, yet when I stretch out my hand to you for<lb>
help, not one of all you virtuous, Christian women dare<lb>
take it and keep me from a life that 's worse than hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke Rachel flung out her hand with a half-defiant<lb>
gesture, and Christie took it. That touch, full<lb>
of womanly compassion, seemed to exorcise the desperate<lb>
spirit that possessed the poor girl in her despair,<lb>
for, with a stifled exclamation, she sunk down at Christie's<lb>
feet, and lay there weeping in all the passionate<lb>
abandonment of love and gratitude, remorse and shame.<lb>
Never had human voice sounded so heavenly sweet to<lb>
her as that which broke the silence of the room, as<lb>
this one friend said, with the earnestness of a true and<lb>
tender heart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. King, if you send her away, I must take her<lb>
in; for if she does go back to the old life, the sin of it<lb>
will lie at our door, and God will remember it against<lb>
us in the end. Some one must trust her, help her, love<lb>
her, and so save her, as nothing else will. Perhaps I<lb>
can do this better than you, &mdash; at least, I 'll try; for even<lb>
if I risk the loss of my good name, I could bear that better<lb>
than the thought that Rachel had lost the work of<lb>
these hard years for want of upholding now. She shall<lb>
come home with me; no one there need know of this<lb>
discovery, and I will take any work to her that you<lb>
<pb n="140">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-151">

<figdesc>Page 140.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
will give me, to keep her from want and its temptations.<lb>
Will you do this, and let me sew for less, if I<lb>
can pay you for the kindness in no other way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. King was &ldquo;much tumbled up and down<lb>
in her own mind;&rdquo; she longed to consent, but Cotton's<lb>
eye was upon her, and Cotton's departure would be an<lb>
irreparable loss, so she decided to end the matter in the<lb>
most summary manner. Plunging a particularly large<lb>
pin into her cushioned breast, as if it was a relief to<lb>
inflict that mock torture upon herself, she said sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible. You can do as you please, Miss<lb>
Devon, but I prefer to wash my hands of the affair at<lb>
once and entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie's eye went from the figure at her feet to the<lb>
hard-featured woman who had been a kind and just<lb>
mistress until now, and she asked, anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you wash your hands of me also,<lb>
if I stand by Rachel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. I 'm very sorry, but my young ladies <hi rend="italics">must</hi><lb>
keep respectable company, or leave my service,&rdquo; was<lb>
the brief reply, for Mrs. King grew grimmer externally<lb>
as the mental rebellion increased internally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> leave it!&rdquo; cried Christie, with an indignant<lb>
voice and eye. &ldquo;Come, dear, we 'll go together.&rdquo;<lb>
And without a look or word for any in the room, she<lb>
raised the prostrate girl, and led her out into the little<lb>
hall.</p>
<p>There she essayed to comfort her, but before many<lb>
words had passed her lips Rachel looked up, and she<lb>
was silent with surprise, for the face she saw was<lb>
neither despairing nor defiant, but beautifully sweet<lb>
and clear, as the unfallen spirit of the woman shone<lb>
<pb n="141">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-152">

<figdesc>Page 141.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
through the grateful eyes, and blessed her for her<lb>
loyalty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie, you have done enough for me,&rdquo; she said.<lb>
&ldquo;Go back, and keep the good place you need, for such<lb>
are hard to find. I can get on alone; I 'm used to this,<lb>
and the pain will soon be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll not go back!&rdquo; cried Christie, hotly. I 'll do<lb>
slop-work and starve, before I 'll stay with such a narrow-minded,<lb>
cold-hearted woman. Come home with<lb>
me at once, and let us lay our plans together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear; if I wouldn't go when you first asked me,<lb>
much less will I go now, for I 've done you harm<lb>
enough already. I never can thank you for your great<lb>
goodness to me, never tell you what it has been to me.<lb>
We must part now; but some day I 'll come back and<lb>
show you that I 've not forgotten how you loved and<lb>
helped and trusted me, when all the others cast me<lb>
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vain were Christie's arguments and appeals. Rachel<lb>
was immovable, and all her friend could win from her<lb>
was a promise to send word, now and then, how things<lb>
prospered with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Rachel, I charge you to come to me in any<lb>
strait, no matter what it is, no matter where I am; for<lb>
if any thing could break my heart, it would be to know<lb>
that you had gone back to the old life, because there<lb>
was no one to help and hold you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">never</hi> can go back; you have saved me, Christie,<lb>
for you love me, you have faith in me, and that will<lb>
keep me strong and safe when you are gone. Oh, my<lb>
dear, my dear, God bless you for ever and for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Christie, remembering only that they were two<lb>
<pb n="142">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-153">

<figdesc>Page 142.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
loving women, alone in a world of sin and sorrow,<lb>
took Rachel in her arms, kissed and cried over her<lb>
with sisterly affection, and watched her prayerfully,<lb>
as she went away to begin her hard task anew, with<lb>
nothing but the touch of innocent lips upon her cheek,<lb>
the baptism of tender tears upon her forehead to keep<lb>
her from despair.</p>
<p>Still cherishing the hope that Rachel would come<lb>
back to her, Christie neither returned to Mrs. King<lb>
nor sought another place of any sort, but took home<lb>
work from a larger establishment, and sat sewing diligently<lb>
in her little room, waiting, hoping, longing for<lb>
her friend. But month after month went by, and no<lb>
word, no sign came to comfort her. She would not<lb>
doubt, yet she could not help fearing, and in her<lb>
nightly prayer no petition was more fervently made<lb>
than that which asked the Father of both saint and<lb>
sinner to keep poor Rachel safe, and bring her back in<lb>
his good time.</p>
<p>Never had she been so lonely as now, for Christie<lb>
had a social heart, and, having known the joy of a<lb>
cordial friendship even for a little while, life seemed<lb>
very barren to her when she lost it. No new friend<lb>
took Rachel's place, for none came to her, and a feeling<lb>
of loyalty kept her from seeking one. But she suffered<lb>
for the want of genial society, for all the tenderness<lb>
of her nature seemed to have been roused by<lb>
that brief but most sincere affection. Her hungry<lb>
heart clamored for the happiness that was its right,<lb>
and grew very heavy as she watched friends or lovers<lb>
walking in the summer twilight when she took her<lb>
evening stroll. Often her eyes followed some humble<lb>
<pb n="143">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-154">

<figdesc>Page 143.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
pair, longing to bless and to be blessed by the divine<lb>
passion whose magic beautifies the little milliner and<lb>
her lad with the same tender grace as the poet and the<lb>
mistress whom he makes immortal in a song. But<lb>
neither friend nor lover came to Christie, and she said<lb>
to herself, with a sad sort of courage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be solitary all my life, perhaps; so the sooner<lb>
I make up my mind to it, the easier it will be to<lb>
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Christmas-tide she made a little festival for herself,<lb>
by giving to each of the household drudges the<lb>
most generous gift she could afford, for no one else<lb>
thought of them, and having known some of the hardships<lb>
of servitude herself, she had much sympathy with<lb>
those in like case.</p>
<p>Then, with the pleasant recollection of two plain<lb>
faces, brightened by gratitude, surprise, and joy, she<lb>
went out into the busy streets to forget the solitude she<lb>
left behind her.</p>
<p>Very gay they were with snow and sleigh-bells, hollyboughs,<lb>
and garlands, below, and Christmas sunshine<lb>
in the winter sky above. All faces shone, all voices had<lb>
a cheery ring, and everybody stepped briskly on<lb>
errands of good-will. Up and down went Christie,<lb>
making herself happy in the happiness of others.<lb>
Looking in at the shop-windows, she watched, with<lb>
interest, the purchases of busy parents, calculating how<lb>
best to fill the little socks hung up at home, with a<lb>
childish faith that never must be disappointed, no matter<lb>
how hard the times might be. She was glad to see<lb>
so many turkeys on their way to garnish hospitable<lb>
tables, and hoped that all the dear home circles might<lb>
<pb n="144">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-155">

<figdesc>Page 144.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
be found unbroken, though she had place in none. No<lb>
Christmas-tree went by leaving a whiff of piny sweetness<lb>
behind, that she did not wish it all success, and<lb>
picture to herself the merry little people dancing in its<lb>
light. And whenever she saw a ragged child eying a<lb>
window full of goodies, smiling even while it shivered,<lb>
she could not resist playing Santa Claus till her purse<lb>
was empty, sending the poor little souls enraptured<lb>
home with oranges and apples in either hand, and<lb>
splendid sweeties in their pockets, for the babies.</p>
<p>No envy mingled with the melancholy that would<lb>
not be dispelled even by these gentle acts, for her heart<lb>
was very tender that night, and if any one had asked<lb>
what gifts she desired most, she would have answered<lb>
with a look more pathetic than any shivering child had<lb>
given her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the sound of a loving voice; the touch of a<lb>
friendly hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going home, at last, to the lonely little room where<lb>
no Christmas fire burned, no tree shone, no household<lb>
group awaited her, she climbed the long, dark stairs,<lb>
with drops on her cheeks, warmer than any melted<lb>
snow-flake could have left, and opening her door<lb>
paused on the threshold, smiling with wonder and<lb>
delight, for in her absence some gentle spirit <hi rend="italics">had</hi><lb>
remembered her. A fire burned cheerily upon the<lb>
hearth, her lamp was lighted, a lovely rose-tree, in full<lb>
bloom, filled the air with its delicate breath, and in its<lb>
shadow lay a note from Rachel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A merry Christmas and a happy New Year, Christie!<lb>
Long ago you gave me your little rose; I have<lb>
<pb n="145">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-156">

<figdesc>Page 145.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="7* J">
watched and tended it for your sake, dear, and now<lb>
when I want to show my love and thankfulness, I give<lb>
it back again as my one treasure. I crept in while you<lb>
were gone, because I feared I might harm you in some<lb>
way if you saw me. I longed to stay and tell you that<lb>
I am safe and well, and busy, with your good face looking<lb>
into mine, but I don't deserve that yet. Only love<lb>
me, trust me, pray for me, and some day you shall<lb>
know what you have done for me. Till then, God bless<lb>
and keep you, dearest friend, your <hi rend="smallcaps">Rachel.</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had sweeter tears fallen than those that<lb>
dropped upon the little tree as Christie took it in her<lb>
arms, and all the rosy clusters leaned toward her as if<lb>
eager to deliver tender messages. Surely her wish was<lb>
granted now, for friendly hands had been at work for<lb>
her. Warm against her heart lay words as precious as<lb>
if uttered by a loving voice, and nowhere, on that<lb>
happy night, stood a fairer Christmas tree than that<lb>
which bloomed so beautifully from the heart of a Magdalen<lb>
who loved much and was forgiven.</p>

</p>
<p>THE year that followed was the saddest Christie<lb>
had ever known, for she suffered a sort of poverty<lb>
which is more difficult to bear than actual want, since<lb>
money cannot lighten it, and the rarest charity alone<lb>
can minister to it. Her heart was empty and she could<lb>
not fill it; her soul was hungry and she could not feed<lb>
it; life was cold and dark and she could not warm and<lb>
brighten it, for she knew not where to go.</p>
<p>She tried to help herself by all the means in her<lb>
power, and when effort after effort failed she said: &ldquo;I<lb>
am not good enough yet to deserve happiness. I think<lb>
too much of human love, too little of divine. When I<lb>
have made God my friend perhaps He will let me find<lb>
and keep one heart to make life happy with. How<lb>
shall I know God? Who will tell me where to find<lb>
Him, and help me to love and lean upon Him as I<lb>
ought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all sincerity she asked these questions, in all sincerity<lb>
she began her search, and with pathetic patience<lb>
waited for an answer. She read many books, some<lb>
wise, some vague, some full of superstition, all unsatisfactory<lb>
to one who wanted a living God. She went to<lb>
<pb n="147">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-158">

<figdesc>Page 147.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
many churches, studied many creeds, and watched<lb>
their fruits as well as she could; but still remained<lb>
unsatisfied. Some were cold and narrow, some seemed<lb>
theatrical and superficial, some stern and terrible, none<lb>
simple, sweet, and strong enough for humanity's many<lb>
needs. There was too much machinery, too many<lb>
walls, laws, and penalties between the Father and his<lb>
children. Too much fear, too little love; too many<lb>
saints and intercessors; too little faith in the instincts<lb>
of the soul which turns to God as flowers to the sun.<lb>
Too much idle strife about names and creeds; too little<lb>
knowledge of the natural religion which has no name<lb>
but godliness, whose creed is boundless and benignant<lb>
as the sunshine, whose faith is as the tender trust of<lb>
little children in their mother's love.</p>
<p>Nowhere did Christie find this all-sustaining power,<lb>
this paternal friend, and comforter, and after months of<lb>
patient searching she gave up her quest, saying, despondently:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm afraid I never shall get religion, for all taht 's<lb>
offered me seems so poor, so narrow, or so hard that I<lb>
cannot take it for my stay. A God of wrath I cannot<lb>
love; a God that must be propitiated, adorned, and<lb>
adored like an idol I cannot respect; and a God who<lb>
can be blinded to men's iniquities through the week by<lb>
a little beating of the breast and bowing down on the<lb>
seventh day, I cannot serve. I want a Father to whom<lb>
I can go with all my sins and sorrows, all my hopes and<lb>
joys, as freely and fearlessly as I used to go to my<lb>
human father, sure of help and sympathy and love.<lb>
Shall I ever find Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas, poor Christie! she was going through the<lb>
<pb n="148">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-159">

<figdesc>Page 148.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sorrowful perplexity that comes to so many before they<lb>
learn that religion cannot be given or bought, but must<lb>
grow as trees grow, needing frost and snow, rain and<lb>
wind to strengthen it before it is deep-rooted in the<lb>
soul; that God is in the hearts of all, and they that<lb>
seek shall surely find Him when they need Him most.</p>
<p>So Christie waited for religion to reveal itself to her,<lb>
and while she waited worked with an almost desperate<lb>
industry, trying to buy a little happiness for herself by<lb>
giving a part of her earnings to those whose needs<lb>
money could supply. She clung to her little room, for<lb>
there she could live her own life undisturbed, and preferred<lb>
to stint herself in other ways rather than give<lb>
up this liberty. Day after day she sat there sewing<lb>
health of mind and body into the long seams or dainty<lb>
stitching that passed through her busy hands, and while<lb>
she sewed she thought sad, bitter, oftentimes rebellious<lb>
thoughts.</p>
<p>It was the worst life she could have led just then,<lb>
for, deprived of the active, cheerful influences she most<lb>
needed, her mind preyed on itself, slowly and surely,<lb>
preparing her for the dark experience to come. She<lb>
knew that there was fitter work for her somewhere,<lb>
but how to find it was a problem which wiser women<lb>
have often failed to solve. She was no pauper, yet was<lb>
one of those whom poverty sets at odds with the world,<lb>
for favors burden and dependence makes the bread<lb>
bitter unless love brightens the one and sweetens the<lb>
other.</p>
<p>There are many Christies, willing to work, yet unable<lb>
to bear the contact with coarser natures which makes<lb>
labor seem degrading, or to endure the hard struggle<lb>
<pb n="149">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-160">

<figdesc>Page 149.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
for the bare necessities of life when life has lost all that<lb>
makes it beautiful. People wonder when such as she<lb>
say they can find little to do; but to those who know<lb>
nothing of the pangs of pride, the sacrifices of feeling,<lb>
the martyrdoms of youth, love, hope, and ambition that<lb>
go on under the faded cloaks of these poor gentlewomen,<lb>
who tell them to go into factories, or scrub in<lb>
kitchens, for there is work enough for all, the most convincing<lb>
answer would be, &ldquo;Try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie kept up bravely till a wearisome low fever<lb>
broke both strength and spirit, and brought the weight<lb>
of debt upon her when least fitted to bear or cast it off.<lb>
For the first time she began to feel that she had nerves<lb>
which would rebel, and a heart that could not long<lb>
endure isolation from its kind without losing the cheerful<lb>
courage which hitherto had been her staunchest<lb>
friend. Perfect rest, kind care, and genial society were<lb>
the medicines she needed, but there was no one to minister<lb>
to her, and she went blindly on along the road so<lb>
many women tread.</p>
<p>She left her bed too soon, fearing to ask too much of<lb>
the busy people who had done their best to be neighborly.<lb>
She returned to her work when it felt heavy in<lb>
her feeble hands, for debt made idleness seem wicked<lb>
to her conscientious mind. And, worst of all, she fell<lb>
back into the bitter, brooding mood which had become<lb>
habitual to her since she lived alone. While the tired<lb>
hands slowly worked, the weary brain ached and burned with heavy thoughts, vain longings, and feverish fancies,<lb>
till things about her sometimes seemed as strange and<lb>
spectral as the phantoms that had haunted her half-delirious<lb>
sleep. Inexpressibly wretched were the dreary<lb>
<pb n="150">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-161">

<figdesc>Page 150.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
days, the restless nights, with only pain and labor for<lb>
companions. The world looked very dark to her, life<lb>
seemed an utter failure, God a delusion, and the long,<lb>
lonely years before her too hard to be endured.</p>
<p>It is not always want, insanity, or sin that drives<lb>
women to desperate deaths; often it is a dreadful loneliness<lb>
of heart, a hunger for home and friends, worse<lb>
than starvation, a bitter sense of wrong in being denied<lb>
the tender ties, the pleasant duties, the sweet rewards<lb>
that can make the humblest life happy; a rebellious<lb>
protest against God, who, when they cry for bread,<lb>
seems to offer them a stone. Some of these impatient<lb>
souls throw life away, and learn too late how rich it<lb>
might have been with a stronger faith, a more submissive<lb>
spirit. Others are kept, and slowly taught to<lb>
stand and wait, till blest with a happiness the sweeter<lb>
for the doubt that went before.</p>
<p>There came a time to Christie when the mist about<lb>
her was so thick she would have stumbled and fallen<lb>
had not the little candle, kept alight by her own hand,<lb>
showed her how far &ldquo;a good deed shines in a naughty<lb>
world;&rdquo; and when God seemed utterly forgetful of her<lb>
He sent a friend to save and comfort her.</p>
<p>March winds were whistling among the house-tops,<lb>
and the sky was darkening with a rainy twilight as<lb>
Christie folded up her finished work, stretched her<lb>
weary limbs, and made ready for her daily walk. Even<lb>
this was turned to profit, for then she took home her<lb>
work, went in search of more, and did her own small<lb>
marketing. As late hours and unhealthy labor destroyed<lb>
appetite, and unpaid debts made each mouthful<lb>
difficult to swallow with Mrs. Flint's hard eye upon<lb>
<pb n="151">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-162">

<figdesc>Page 151.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her, she had undertaken to supply her own food, and<lb>
so lessen the obligation that burdened her. An unwise<lb>
retrenchment, for, busied with the tasks that must be<lb>
done, she too often neglected or deferred the meals to<lb>
which no society lent interest, no appetite gave flavor;<lb>
and when the fuel was withheld the fire began to die<lb>
out spark by spark.</p>
<p>As she stood before the little mirror, smoothing the<lb>
hair upon her forehead, she watched the face reflected<lb>
there, wondering if it could be the same she used to<lb>
see so fall of youth and hope and energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I 'm growing old; my youth is nearly over,<lb>
and at thirty I shall be a faded, dreary woman, like so<lb>
many I see and pity. It 's hard to come to this after<lb>
trying so long to find my place, and do my duty. I 'm<lb>
a failure after all, and might as well have stayed with<lb>
Aunt Betsey or married Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Devon, to-day is Saturday, and I 'm makin' up<lb>
my bills, so I 'll trouble you for your month's board,<lb>
and as much on the old account as you can let me<lb>
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Flint spoke, and her sharp voice rasped the<lb>
silence like a file, for she had entered without knocking,<lb>
and her demand was the first intimation of her presence.<lb>
</p>
<p>Christie turned slowly round, for there was no elasticity<lb>
in her motions now; through the melancholy<lb>
anxiety her face always wore of late, there came the<lb>
worried look of one driven almost beyond endurance,<lb>
and her hands began to tremble nervously as she tied<lb>
on her bonnet. Mrs. Flint was a hard woman, and<lb>
dunned her debtors relentlessly; Christie dreaded the<lb>
<pb n="152">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-163">

<figdesc>Page 152.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sight of her, and would have left the house had she<lb>
been free of debt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just going to take these things home and get<lb>
more work. I am sure of being paid, and you shall<lb>
have all I get. But, for Heaven's sake, give me time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days and a night of almost uninterrupted labor<lb>
had given a severe strain to her nerves, and left her in<lb>
a dangerous state. Something in her face arrested<lb>
Mrs. Flint's attention; she observed that Christie was<lb>
putting on her best cloak and hat, and to her suspicious<lb>
eye the bundle of work looked unduly large.</p>
<p>It had been a hard day for the poor woman, for the<lb>
cook had gone off in a huff; the chamber girl been<lb>
detected in petty larceny; two desirable boarders had<lb>
disappointed her; and the incapable husband had fallen<lb>
ill, so it was little wonder that her soul was tried, her<lb>
sharp voice sharper, and her sour temper sourer than<lb>
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">have</hi> heard of folks putting on their best things<lb>
and going out, but never coming back again, when<lb>
they owed money. It 's a mean trick, but it 's sometimes<lb>
done by them you wouldn't think it of,&rdquo; she said,<lb>
with an aggravating sniff of intelligence.</p>
<p>To be suspected of dishonesty was the last drop in<lb>
Christie's full cup. She looked at the woman with a<lb>
strong desire to do something violent, for every nerve<lb>
was tingling with irritation and anger. But she controlled<lb>
herself, though her face was colorless and her<lb>
hands were more tremulous than before. Unfastening<lb>
her comfortable cloak she replaced it with a shabby<lb>
shawl; took off her neat bonnet and put on a hood,<lb>
unfolded six linen shirts, and shook them out before her<lb>
<pb n="153">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-164">

<figdesc>Page 153.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="7*">
landlady's eyes; then retied the parcel, and, pausing on<lb>
the threshold of the door, looked back with an expression<lb>
that haunted the woman long afterward, as she<lb>
said, with the quiver of strong excitement in her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Flint, I have always dealt honorably by you;<lb>
I always mean to do it, and don't deserve to be suspected<lb>
of dishonesty like that. I leave every thing I<lb>
own behind me, and if I don't come back, you can sell<lb>
them all and pay yourself, for I feel now as if I <hi rend="italics">never</hi><lb>
wanted to see you or this room again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went rapidly away, supported by her indignation,<lb>
for she had done her best to pay her debts; had<lb>
sold the few trinkets she possessed, and several treasures<lb>
given by the Carrols, to settle her doctor's bill,<lb>
and had been half killing herself to satisfy Mrs. Flint's<lb>
demands. The consciousness that she had been too<lb>
lavish in her generosity when fortune smiled upon her,<lb>
made the present want all the harder to bear. But she<lb>
would neither beg nor borrow, though she knew Harry<lb>
would delight to give, and Uncle Enos lend her money,<lb>
with a lecture on extravagance, gratis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll paddle my own canoe as long as I can,&rdquo; she<lb>
said, sternly; &ldquo;and when I must ask help I 'll turn to<lb>
strangers for it, or scuttle my boat, and go down without<lb>
troubling any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she came to her employer's door, the servant<lb>
said: &ldquo;Missis was out;&rdquo; then seeing Christie's disappointed<lb>
face, she added, confidentially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it 's any comfort to know it, I can tell you that<lb>
missis wouldn't have paid you if she had a been to<lb>
home. There 's been three other women here with<lb>
work, and she 's put 'em all off. She always does, and<lb>
<pb n="154">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-165">

<figdesc>Page 154.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
beats 'em down into the bargain, which ain't genteel to<lb>
my thinkin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She promised me I should be well paid for these,<lb>
because I undertook to get them done without fail.<lb>
I 've worked day and night rather than disappoint her,<lb>
and felt sure of my money,&rdquo; said Christie, despondently.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm sorry, but you won't get it. She told me to<lb>
tell you your prices was too high, and she could find<lb>
folks to work cheaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not object to the price when I took the<lb>
work, and I have half-ruined my eyes over the fine<lb>
stitching. See if it isn't nicely done.&rdquo; And Christie<lb>
displayed her exquisite needlework with pride.</p>
<p>The girl admired it, and, having a grievance of her<lb>
own, took satisfaction in berating her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's a shame! These things are part of a present<lb>
the ladies are going to give the minister; but I don't<lb>
believe he 'll feel easy in 'em if poor folks is wronged<lb>
to get 'em. Missis won't pay what they are worth, I<lb>
know; for, don't you see, the cheaper the work is done,<lb>
the more money she has to make a spread with her<lb>
share of the present? It 's my opinion you 'd better<lb>
hold on to these shirts till she pays for 'em handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I 'll keep <hi rend="italics">my</hi> promise, and I hope she will<lb>
keep hers. Tell her I need the money very much, and<lb>
have worked very hard to please her. I 'll come again<lb>
on Monday, if I 'm able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie's lips trembled as she spoke, for she was<lb>
feeble still, and the thought of that hard-earned money<lb>
had been her sustaining hope through the weary hours<lb>
spent over that ill-paid work. The girl said &ldquo;<lb>
<pb n="155">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-166">

<figdesc>Page 155.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Good-bye,&rdquo; with a look of mingled pity and respect, for in<lb>
her eyes the seamstress was more of a lady than the<lb>
mistress in this transaction.</p>
<p>Christie hurried to another place, and asked eagerly<lb>
if the young ladies had any work for her. &ldquo;Not a<lb>
stitch,&rdquo; was the reply, and the door closed. She stood<lb>
a moment looking down upon the passers-by wondering<lb>
what answer she would get if she accosted any one;<lb>
and had any especially benevolent face looked back at<lb>
her she would have been tempted to do it, so heart-sick<lb>
and forlorn did she feel just then.</p>
<p>She knocked at several other doors, to receive the<lb>
same reply. She even tried a slop-shop, but it was<lb>
full, and her pale face was against her. Her long illness<lb>
had lost her many patrons, and if one steps out<lb>
from the ranks of needle-women it is very hard to press<lb>
in again, so crowded are they, and so desperate the<lb>
need of money.</p>
<p>One hope remained, and, though the way was long,<lb>
and a foggy drizzle had set in, she minded neither distance<lb>
nor the chilly rain, but hurried away with anxious<lb>
thoughts still dogging her steps. Across a long bridge,<lb>
through muddy roads and up a stately avenue she<lb>
went, pausing, at last, spent and breathless at another<lb>
door.</p>
<p>A servant with a wedding-favor in his button-hole<lb>
opened to her, and, while he went to deliver her urgent<lb>
message, she peered in wistfully from the dreary world<lb>
without, catching glimpses of home-love and happiness<lb>
that made her heart ache for very pity of its own loneliness.<lb>
</p>
<p>A wedding was evidently afoot, for hall and staircase<lb>
<pb n="156">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-167">

<figdesc>Page 156.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
blazed with light and bloomed with flowers. Smiling<lb>
men and maids ran to and fro; opening doors showed<lb>
tables beautiful with bridal white and silver; savory<lb>
odors filled the air; gay voices echoed above and<lb>
below; and once she caught a brief glance at the<lb>
bonny bride, standing with her father's arm about her,<lb>
while her mother gave some last, loving touch to her<lb>
array; and a group of young sisters with April faces<lb>
clustered round her.</p>
<p>The pretty picture vanished all too soon; the man<lb>
returned with a hurried &ldquo;No&rdquo; for answer, and Christie<lb>
went out into the deepening twilight with a strange<lb>
sense of desperation at her heart. It was not the<lb>
refusal, not the fear of want, nor the reaction of overtaxed<lb>
nerves alone; it was the sharpness of the contrast<lb>
between that other woman's fate and her own that<lb>
made her wring her hands together, and cry out,<lb>
bitterly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn't fair, it isn't right, that she should have<lb>
so much and I so little! What have I ever done to be<lb>
so desolate and miserable, and never to find any happiness,<lb>
however hard I try to do what seems my duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, and she went slowly down the<lb>
long avenue, feeling that there was no cause for hurry<lb>
now, and even night and rain and wind were better<lb>
than her lonely room or Mrs. Flint's complaints. Afar<lb>
off the city lights shone faintly through the fog, like<lb>
pale lamps seen in dreams; the damp air cooled her<lb>
feverish cheeks; the road was dark and still, and she<lb>
longed to lie down and rest among the sodden leaves.</p>
<p>When she reached the bridge she saw the draw was<lb>
up, and a spectral ship was slowly passing through.<lb>
<pb n="157">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-168">

<figdesc>Page 157.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
With no desire to mingle in the crowd that waited on<lb>
either side, she paused, and, leaning on the railing, let<lb>
her thoughts wander where they would. As she stood<lb>
there the heavy air seemed to clog her breath and<lb>
wrap her in its chilly arms. She felt as if the springs<lb>
of life were running down, and presently would stop;<lb>
for, even when the old question, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;<lb>
came haunting her, she no longer cared even to try to<lb>
answer it, and had no feeling but one of utter weariness.<lb>
She tried to shake off the strange mood that<lb>
was stealing over her, but spent body and spent brain<lb>
were not strong enough to obey her will, and, in spite<lb>
of her efforts to control it, the impulse that had seized<lb>
her grew more intense each moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I work and suffer any longer for myself<lb>
alone?&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;why wear out my life<lb>
struggling for the bread I have no heart to eat? I am<lb>
not wise enough to find my place, nor patient enough<lb>
to wait until it comes to me. Better give up trying,<lb>
and leave room for those who have something to live<lb>
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many a stronger soul has known a dark hour when<lb>
the importunate wish has risen that it were possible<lb>
and right to lay down the burdens that oppress, the<lb>
perplexities that harass, and hasten the coming of the<lb>
long sleep that needs no lullaby. Such an hour was<lb>
this to Christie, for, as she stood there, that sorrowful<lb>
bewilderment which we call despair came over her, and<lb>
ruled her with a power she could not resist.</p>
<p>A flight of steps close by led to a lumber wharf, and,<lb>
scarcely knowing why, she went down there, with a<lb>
vague desire to sit still somewhere, and think her way<lb>
<pb n="158">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-169">

<figdesc>Page 158.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
out of the mist that seemed to obscure her mind. A<lb>
single tall lamp shone at the farther end of the platform,<lb>
and presently she found herself leaning her hot<lb>
forehead against the iron pillar, while she watched with<lb>
curious interest the black water rolling sluggishly<lb>
below.</p>
<p>She knew it was no place for her, yet no one waited<lb>
for her, no one would care if she staid for ever, and,<lb>
yielding to the perilous fascination that drew her there,<lb>
she lingered with a heavy throbbing in her temples, and<lb>
a troop of wild fancies whirling through her brain.<lb>
Something white swept by below, &mdash; only a broken oar&mdash;<lb>
but she began to wonder how a human body would<lb>
look floating through the night. It was an awesome<lb>
fancy, but it took possession of her, and, as it grew, her<lb>
eyes dilated, her breath came fast, and her lips fell<lb>
apart, for she seemed to see the phantom she had conjured<lb>
up, and it wore the likeness of herself.</p>
<p>With an ominous chill creeping through her blood,<lb>
and a growing tumult in her mind, she thought, &ldquo;I<lb>
<hi rend="italics">must</hi> go,&rdquo; but still stood motionless, leaning over the<lb>
wide gulf, eager to see where that dead thing would<lb>
pass away. So plainly did she see it, so peaceful was<lb>
the white face, so full of rest the folded hands, so<lb>
strangely like, and yet unlike, herself, that she seemed<lb>
to lose her identity, and wondered which was the real<lb>
and which the imaginary Christie. Lower and lower<lb>
she bent; looser and looser grew her hold upon the<lb>
pillar; faster and faster beat the pulses in her temples,<lb>
and the rush of some blind impulse was swiftly coming<lb>
on, when a hand seized and caught her back.</p>
<p>For an instant every thing grew black before her<lb>

eyes, and the earth seemed to slip away from underneath<lb>
her feet. Then she was herself again, and found<lb>
that she was sitting on a pile of lumber, with her head<lb>
uncovered, and a woman's arm about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I going to drown myself?&rdquo; she asked, slowly,<lb>
with a fancy that she had been dreaming frightfully,<lb>
and some one had wakened her.</p>
<pb n="160">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were most gone; but I came in time, thank<lb>
God! O Christie! don't you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! no fear of that; for with one bewildered look,<lb>
one glad cry of recognition, Christie found her friend<lb>
again, and was gathered close to Rachel's heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, my dear, what drove you to it? Tell<lb>
me all, and let me help you in your trouble, as you<lb>
helped me in mine,&rdquo; she said, as she tenderly laid the<lb>
poor, white face upon her breast, and wrapped her<lb>
shawl about the trembling figure clinging to her with<lb>
such passionate delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been ill; I worked too hard; I 'm not<lb>
myself to-night. I owe money. People disappoint and<lb>
worry me; and I was so worn out, and weak, and<lb>
wicked, I think I meant to take my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear; it was not you that meant to do it,<lb>
but the weakness and the trouble that bewildered you.<lb>
Forget it all, and rest a little, safe with me; then we 'll<lb>
talk again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel spoke soothingly, for Christie shivered and<lb>
sighed as if her own thoughts frightened her. For a<lb>
moment they sat silent, while the mist trailed its white<lb>
shroud above them, as if death had paused to beckon<lb>
a tired child away, but, finding her so gently cradled<lb>
on a warm, human heart, had relented and passed on,<lb>
leaving no waif but the broken oar for the river to<lb>
carry toward the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about yourself, Rachel. Where have you<lb>
been so long? I 've looked and waited for you ever<lb>
since the second little note you sent me on last Christmas;<lb>
but you never came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 've been away, dear heart, hard at work in another<lb>

city, larger and wickeder than this. I tried to get work<lb>
here, that I might be near you; but that cruel Cotton<lb>
always found me out; and I was so afraid I should get<lb>
desperate that I went away where I was not known.<lb>
There it came into my mind to do for others more<lb>
wretched than I what you had done for me. God put<lb>
the thought into my heart, and He helped me in my<lb>
work, for it has prospered wonderfully. All this year<lb>
I have been busy with it, and almost happy; for I felt<lb>
that your love made me strong to do it, and that, in<lb>
time, I might grow good enough to be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I am, Rachel, and never say that any<lb>
more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, my poor dear, and let me talk. You are not<lb>
able to do any thing, but rest, and listen. I knew how<lb>
many poor souls went wrong when the devil tempted<lb>
them; and I gave all my strength to saving those who<lb>
were going the way I went. I had no fear, no shame<lb>
to overcome, for I was one of them. They would listen<lb>
to me, for I knew what I spoke; they could believe in<lb>
salvation, for I was saved; they did not feel so outcast<lb>
and forlorn when I told them you had taken me into<lb>
your innocent arms, and loved me like a sister. With<lb>
every one I helped my power increased, and I felt as if<lb>
I had washed away a little of my own great sin. O<lb>
Christie! never think it 's time to die till you are called;<lb>
for the Lord leaves us till we have done our work, and<lb>
never sends more sin and sorrow than we can bear and<lb>
be the better for, if we hold fast by Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So beautiful and brave she looked, so full of strength<lb>
and yet of meek submission was her voice, that Christie's<lb>
heart was thrilled; for it was plain that Rachel<lb>
<pb n="162">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-173">

<figdesc>Page 162.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
had learned how to distil balm from the bitterness of<lb>
life, and, groping in the mire to save lost souls, had<lb>
found her own salvation there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me how to grow pious, strong, and useful, as<lb>
you are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am all wrong, and feel as if I<lb>
never could get right again, for I haven't energy<lb>
enough to care what becomes of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the state, Christie: I 've been through it all!<lb>
but when <hi rend="italics">I</hi> stood where you stand now, there was no<lb>
hand to pull me back, and I fell into a blacker river<lb>
than this underneath our feet. Thank God, I came in<lb>
time to save you from either death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo; asked Christie, when she<lb>
had echoed in her heart the thanksgiving that came<lb>
with such fervor from the other's lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed you on the bridge. I did not see your face,<lb>
but you stood leaning there so wearily, and looking<lb>
down into the water, as I used to look, that I wanted to<lb>
speak, but did not; and I went on to comfort a poor<lb>
girl who is dying yonder. Something turned me back,<lb>
however; and when I saw you down here I knew why<lb>
I was sent. You were almost gone, but I kept you;<lb>
and when I had you in my arms I knew you, though<lb>
it nearly broke my heart to find you here. Now, dear,<lb>
come home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home! ah, Rachel, I 've got no home, and for want<lb>
of one I shall be lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lament that broke from her was more pathetic<lb>
than the tears that streamed down, hot and heavy,<lb>
melting from her heart the frost of her despair. Her<lb>
friend let her weep, knowing well the worth of tears,<lb>
and while Christie sobbed herself quiet, Rachel took<lb>
thought for her as tenderly as any mother.</p>
<pb n="163">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-174">

<figdesc>Page 163.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>When she had heard the story of Christie's troubles,<lb>
she stood up as if inspired with a happy thought, and<lb>
stretching both hands to her friend, said, with an air<lb>
of cheerful assurance most comforting to see:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll take care of you; come with me, my poor Christie,<lb>
and I 'll give you a home, very humble, but honest<lb>
and happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you, Rachel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, I must go back to my work, and you are<lb>
not fit for that. Neither must you go again to your<lb>
own room, because for you it is haunted, and the worst<lb>
place you could be in. You want change, and I 'll give<lb>
you one. It will seem queer at first, but it is a wholesome<lb>
place, and just what you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll do any thing you tell me. I 'm past thinking for<lb>
myself to-night, and only want to be taken care of<lb>
till I find strength and courage enough to stand alone,&rdquo;<lb>
said Christie, rising slowly and looking about her with<lb>
an aspect as helpless and hopeless as if the cloud of<lb>
mist was a wall of iron.</p>
<p>Rachel put on her bonnet for her and wrapped her<lb>
shawl about her, saying, in a tender voice, that warmed<lb>
the other's heart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close by lives a dear, good woman who often befriends<lb>
such as you and I. She will take you in without<lb>
a question, and love to do it, for she is the most<lb>
hospitable soul I know. Just tell her you want work,<lb>
that I sent you, and there will be no trouble. Then,<lb>
when you know her a little, confide in her, and you<lb>
will never come to such a pass as this again. Keep up<lb>
your heart, dear; I 'll not leave you till you are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So cheerily she spoke, so confident she looked, that<lb>
<pb n="164">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-175">

<figdesc>Page 164.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the lost expression passed from Christie's face, and<lb>
hand in hand they went away together, &mdash; two types of<lb>
the sad sisterhood standing on either shore of the dark<lb>
river that is spanned by a Bridge of Sighs.</p>
<p>Rachel led her friend toward the city, and, coming<lb>
to the mechanics' quarter, stopped before the door of<lb>
a small, old house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just knock, say `Rachel sent me,' and you 'll find<lb>
yourself at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay with me, or let me go with you. I can't lose<lb>
you again, for I need you very much,&rdquo; pleaded Christie,<lb>
clinging to her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much as that poor girl dying all alone.<lb>
She's waiting for me, and I must go. But I 'll write<lb>
soon; and remember, Christie, I shall feel as if I had<lb>
only paid a very little of my debt if you go back to the<lb>
sad old life, and lose your faith and hope again. God<lb>
bless and keep you, and when we meet next time let<lb>
me find a happier face than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel kissed it with her heart on her lips, smiled<lb>
her brave sweet smile, and vanished in the mist.</p>
<p>Pausing a moment to collect herself, Christie recollected<lb>
that she had not asked the name of the new<lb>
friend whose help she was about to ask. A little sign<lb>
on the door caught her eye, and, bending down, she<lb>
managed to read by the dim light of the street lamp<lb>
these words:</p>
<p rend="center">&ldquo;C. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilkins,</hi> Clear-Starcher.</p>
<p rend="center">&ldquo;Laces done up in the best style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too tired to care whether a laundress or a lady took<lb>
her in, she knocked timidly, and, while she waited for<lb>
<pb n="165"><target id="p445-176">p445-176</target>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-176">
<head>&ldquo;C. Wilkins, Clear Starcher.&rdquo;</head>
<figdesc>445EAF. Page 165. In-line image of C. Wilkins, a large woman with no front teeth and a

</eaffig>
an answer to her summons, stood listening to the noises<lb>
within.</p>
<p>A swashing sound as of water was audible, likewise a<lb>
scuffling as of flying feet; some one clapped hands, and<lb>
a voice said, warningly, &ldquo;Into your beds this instant<lb>
minute or I 'll come to you! Andrew Jackson, give<lb>
Gusty a boost; Ann Lizy, don't you tech Wash's feet<lb>
to tickle 'em. Set pretty in the tub, Victory, dear,<lb>
while ma sees who 's rappin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then heavy footsteps approached, the door opened<lb>
wide, and a large woman appeared, with fuzzy red<lb>
hair, no front teeth, and a plump, clean face, brightly<lb>
illuminated by the lamp she carried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Rachel sent me. She thought you<lb>
might be able&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>Christie got no further, for C. Wilkins put out a<lb>
strong bare arm, still damp, and gently drew her in,<lb>
<pb n="166">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-177">

<figdesc>Page 166.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
saying, with the same motherly tone as when addressing<lb>
her children, &ldquo;Come right in, dear, and don't mind<lb>
the clutter things is in. I 'm givin' the children their<lb>
Sat'day scrubbin', and they will slop and kite 'round,<lb>
no matter ef I do spank 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking all the way in such an easy, comfortable<lb>
voice that Christie felt as if she must have heard it<lb>
before, Mrs. Wilkins led her unexpected guest into a<lb>
small kitchen, smelling suggestively of soap-suds and<lb>
warm flat-irons. In the middle of this apartment was<lb>
a large tub; in the tub a chubby child sat, sucking a<lb>
sponge and staring calmly at the new-comer with a<lb>
pair of big blue eyes, while little drops shone in the<lb>
yellow curls and on the rosy shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pretty!&rdquo; cried Christie, seeing nothing else<lb>
and stopping short to admire this innocent little Venus<lb>
rising from the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she is! Ma's darlin' lamb! and ketchin' her<lb>
death a cold this blessed minnit. Set right down, my<lb>
dear, and tuck your wet feet into the oven. I' ll have<lb>
a dish o' tea for you in less 'n no time; and while it 's<lb>
drawin' I' ll clap Victory Adelaide into her bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie sank into a shabby but most hospitable old<lb>
chair, dropped her bonnet on the floor, put her feet in<lb>
the oven, and, leaning back, watched Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
wipe the baby as if she had come for that especial purpose.<lb>
As Rachel predicted, she found herself at home<lb>
at once, and presently was startled to hear a laugh<lb>
from her own lips when several children in red and<lb>
yellow flannel night-gowns darted like meteors across<lb>
the open doorway of an adjoining room, with whoops<lb>
and howls, bursts of laughter, and antics of all sorts.</p>
<pb n="167">

</p>
<p>How pleasant it was; that plain room, with no ornaments<lb>
but the happy faces, no elegance, but cleanliness,<lb>
no wealth, but hospitality and lots of love. This latter<lb>
blessing gave the place its charm, for, though Mrs.<lb>
Wilkins threatened to take her infants' noses off if they<lb>
got out of bed again, or &ldquo;put 'em in the kettle and<lb>
bile 'em&rdquo; they evidently knew no fear, but gambolled<lb>
all the nearer to her for the threat; and she beamed<lb>
upon them with such maternal tenderness and pride<lb>
that her homely face grew beautiful in Christie's eyes.</p>
<p>When the baby was bundled up in a blanket and<lb>
about to be set down before the stove to simmer a<lb>
trifle before being put to bed, Christie held out her<lb>
arms, saying with an irresistible longing in her eyes<lb>
and voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hold her! I love babies dearly, and it seems<lb>
as if it would do me more good than quarts of tea to<lb>
cuddle her, if she 'll let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, that's real sensible; and mother's bird 'll<lb>
set along with you as good as a kitten. Toast her<lb>
tootsies wal, for she 's croupy, and I have to be extra<lb>
choice of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good it feels!&rdquo; sighed Christie, half devouring<lb>
the warm and rosy little bunch in her lap, while baby<lb>
lay back luxuriously, spreading her pink toes to the<lb>
pleasant warmth and smiling sleepily up in the hungry<lb>
face that hung over her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins's quick eyes saw it all, and she said to<lb>
herself, in the closet, as she cut bread and rattled down<lb>
a cup and saucer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's what she wants, poor creeter; I 'll let her<lb>
have a right nice time, and warm and feed and chirk<lb>
<pb n="168">

</eaffig>
her up, and then I 'll see what 's to be done for her. She<lb>
ain't one of the common sort, and goodness only knows<lb>
what Rachel sent her here for. She 's poor and sick,<lb>
but she ain't bad. I can tell that by her face, and she 's<lb>
the sort I like to help. It 's a mercy I ain't eat my supper,<lb>
so she can have that bit of meat and the pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting a tray on the little table, the good soul set<lb>
forth all she had to give, and offered it with such hospitable<lb>
warmth that Christie ate and drank with unaccustomed<lb>
appetite, finishing off deliciously with a<lb>
kiss from baby before she was borne away by her<lb>
mother to the back bedroom, where peace soon<lb>
reigned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let me tell you who I am, and how I came to<lb>
you in such an unceremonious way,&rdquo; began Christie,<lb>
when her hostess returned and found her warmed,<lb>
refreshed, and composed by a woman's three best comforters, &mdash;<lb>
kind words, a baby, and a cup of tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Pears to me, dear, I wouldn't rile myself up by<lb>
telling any werryments to-night, but git right warm<lb>
inter bed, and have a good long sleep,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins,<lb>
without a ray of curiosity in her wholesome red<lb>
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don't know any thing about me, and I may<lb>
be the worst woman in the world,&rdquo; cried Christie,<lb>
anxious to prove herself worthy of such confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you want takin' care of, child, or<lb>
Rachel wouldn't a sent you. Ef I can help any one, I<lb>
don't want no introduction; and ef you be the wust<lb>
woman in the world (which you ain't), I wouldn't shet<lb>
my door on you, for then you 'd need a lift more 'n you<lb>
do now.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>Christie could only put out her hand, and mutely<lb>
thank her new friend with full eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You 're fairly tuckered out, you poor soul, so you<lb>
jest come right up chamber and let me tuck you<lb>
up, else you 'll be down sick. It ain't a mite of inconvenience;<lb>
the room is kep for company, and it 's all<lb>
ready, even to a clean night-cap. I 'm goin' to clap<lb>
this warm flat to your feet when you 're fixed; it 's<lb>
amazin' comfortin' and keeps your head cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up they went to a tidy little chamber, and Christie<lb>
found herself laid down to rest none too soon, for she<lb>
was quite worn out. Sleep began to steal over her the<lb>
moment her head touched the pillow, in spite of the<lb>
much beruffled cap which Mrs. Wilkins put on with<lb>
visible pride in its stiffly crimped borders. She was<lb>
dimly conscious of a kind hand tucking her up, a comfortable<lb>
voice purring over her, and, best of all, a<lb>
motherly good-night kiss, then the weary world faded<lb>
quite away and she was at rest.</p>

</p>
<p>WHEN Christie opened the eyes that had closed<lb>
so wearily, afternoon sunshine streamed across<lb>
the room, and seemed the herald of happier days.<lb>
Refreshed by sleep, and comforted by grateful recollections<lb>
of her kindly welcome, she lay tranquilly enjoying<lb>
the friendly atmosphere about her, with so strong a<lb>
feeling that a skilful hand had taken the rudder, that<lb>
she felt very little anxiety or curiosity about the haven<lb>
which was to receive her boat after this narrow escape<lb>
from shipwreck.</p>
<pb n="171">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-182">

<figdesc>Page 171.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Her eye wandered to and fro, and brightened as it<lb>
went; for though a poor, plain room it was as neat as<lb>
hands could make it, and so glorified with sunshine<lb>
that she thought it a lovely place, in spite of the yellow<lb>
paper with green cabbage roses on it, the gorgeous<lb>
plaster statuary on the mantel-piece, and the fragrance<lb>
of dough-nuts which pervaded the air. Every thing<lb>
suggested home life, humble but happy, and Christie's<lb>
solitary heart warmed at the sights and sounds about<lb>
her.</p>
<p>A half open closet-door gave her glimpses of little<lb>
frocks and jackets, stubby little shoes, and go-to-meeting<lb>
hats all in a row. From below came up the sound<lb>
of childish voices chattering, childish feet trotting to<lb>
and fro, and childish laughter sounding sweetly through<lb>
the Sabbath stillness of the place. From a room near<lb>
by, came the soothing creak of a rocking-chair, the<lb>
rustle of a newspaper, and now and then a scrap of<lb>
conversation common-place enough, but pleasant to<lb>
hear, because so full of domestic love and confidence;<lb>
and, as she listened, Christie pictured Mrs. Wilkins and<lb>
her husband taking their rest together after the week's<lb>
hard work was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could stay here; it 's so comfortable and<lb>
home-like. I wonder if they wouldn't let me have this<lb>
room, and help me to find some better work than sewing?<lb>
I 'll get up and ask them,&rdquo; thought Christie,<lb>
feeling an irresistible desire to stay, and strong repugnance<lb>
to returning to the room she had left, for, as<lb>
Rachel truly said, it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> haunted for her.</p>
<p>When she opened the door to go down, Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
<pb n="172">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-183">

<figdesc>Page 172.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
bounced out of her rocking-chair and hurried to meet<lb>
her with a smiling face, saying all in one breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good mornin', dear! Rested well, I hope? I 'm<lb>
proper glad to hear it. Now come right down and<lb>
have your dinner. I kept it hot, for I couldn't bear to<lb>
wake you up, you was sleepin' so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so worn out I slept like a baby, and feel like<lb>
a new creature. It was so kind of you to take me in,<lb>
and I 'm so grateful I don't know how to show it,&rdquo; said<lb>
Christie, warmly, as her hostess ponderously descended<lb>
the complaining stairs and ushered her into the tidy<lb>
kitchen from which tubs and flat-irons were banished<lb>
one day in the week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawful sakes, the' ain't nothing to be grateful for,<lb>
child, and you 're heartily welcome to the little I done.<lb>
We are country folks in our ways, though we be livin'<lb>
in the city, and we have a reg'lar country dinner Sundays.<lb>
Hope you 'll relish it; my vittles is clean ef<lb>
they ain't rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Mrs. Wilkins dished up baked beans,<lb>
Indian-pudding, and brown bread enough for half a<lb>
dozen. Christie was hungry now, and ate with an<lb>
appetite that delighted the good lady who vibrated<lb>
between her guest and her children, shut up in the<lb>
&ldquo;settin'-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now please let me tell you all about myself, for I<lb>
am afraid you think me something better than I am.<lb>
If I ask help from you, it is right that you should<lb>
know whom you are helping,&rdquo; said Christie, when the<lb>
table was cleared and her hostess came and sat down<lb>
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, free your mind, and then we 'll fix<lb>
<pb n="173">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-184">

<figdesc>Page 173.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
things up right smart. Nothin' I like better, and Lisha<lb>
says I have considerable of a knack that way,&rdquo; replied<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins, with a smile, a nod, and an air of interest<lb>
most reassuring.</p>
<p>So Christie told her story, won to entire confidence<lb>
by the sympathetic face opposite, and the motherly pats<lb>
so gently given by the big, rough hand that often met<lb>
her own. When all was told, Christie said very earnestly:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to go to work to-morrow, and will do<lb>
any thing I can find, but I <hi rend="italics">should</hi> love to stay here a<lb>
little while, if I could; I do so dread to be alone. Is<lb>
it possible? I mean to pay my board of course, and<lb>
help you besides if you 'll let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins glowed with pleasure at this compliment,<lb>
and leaning toward Christie, looked into her face<lb>
a moment in silence, as if to test the sincerity of the<lb>
wish. In that moment Christie saw what steady, sagacious<lb>
eyes the woman had; so clear, so honest that<lb>
she looked through them into the great, warm heart<lb>
below, and looking forgot the fuzzy, red hair, the paucity<lb>
of teeth, the faded gown, and felt only the attraction<lb>
of a nature genuine and genial as the sunshine<lb>
dancing on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Beautiful souls often get put into plain bodies, but<lb>
they cannot be hidden, and have a power all their own,<lb>
the greater for the unconsciousness or the humility<lb>
which gives it grace. Christie saw and felt this then,<lb>
and when the homely woman spoke, listened to her<lb>
with implicit confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I 'd no more send you away now than I<lb>
would my Adelaide, for you need looking after for a<lb>
<pb n="174">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-185">

<figdesc>Page 174.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
spell, most as much as she doos. You 've been thinkin'<lb>
and broodin' too much, and sewin' yourself to death.<lb>
We 'll stop all that, and keep you so busy there won't<lb>
be no time for the hypo. You 're one of them that<lb>
can't live alone without starvin' somehow, so I 'm jest<lb>
goin' to turn you in among them children to paster, so<lb>
to speak. That 's wholesome and fillin' for <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> and<lb>
goodness knows it will be a puffect charity to <hi rend="italics">me,</hi> for<lb>
I 'm goin' to be dreadful drove with gettin' up curtins<lb>
and all manner of things, as spring comes on. So it<lb>
ain't no favor on my part, and you can take out your<lb>
board in tendin' baby and putterin' over them little<lb>
tykes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like it <hi rend="italics">so</hi> much! But I forgot my debt to<lb>
Mrs. Flint; perhaps she won't let me go,&rdquo; said Christie,<lb>
with an anxious cloud coming over her brightening<lb>
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful, suz! don't you be werried about her. I 'll<lb>
see to her, and ef she acts ugly Lisha 'll fetch her<lb>
round; men can always settle such things better 'n we<lb>
can, and he 's a dreadful smart man Lisha is. We 'll<lb>
go to-morrer and get your belongins, and then settle<lb>
right down for a spell; and by-an'-by when you git a<lb>
trifle more chipper we 'll find a nice place in the country<lb>
some'rs. That 's what you want; nothin' like green<lb>
grass and woodsy smells to right folks up. When I<lb>
was a gal, ef I got low in my mind, or riled in my<lb>
temper, I jest went out and grubbed in the gardin, or<lb>
made hay, or walked a good piece, and it fetched me<lb>
round beautiful. Never failed; so I come to see that<lb>
good fresh dirt is fust rate physic for folk's spirits as<lb>
it is for wounds, as they tell on.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="175">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-186">

<figdesc>Page 175.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds sensible and pleasant, and I like it.<lb>
Oh, it is <hi rend="italics">so</hi> beautiful to feel that somebody cares for<lb>
you a little bit, and you ain't one too many in the<lb>
world,&rdquo; sighed Christie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't you never feel that agin, my dear. What 's<lb>
the Lord for ef He ain't to hold on to in times of<lb>
trouble. Faith ain't wuth much ef it 's only lively in<lb>
fair weather; you 've got to believe hearty and stan'<lb>
by the Lord through thick and thin, and He 'll stan' by<lb>
you as no one else begins to. I remember of havin'<lb>
this bore in upon me by somethin' that happened to a<lb>
man I knew. He got blowed up in a powder-mill, and<lb>
when folks asked him what he thought when the bust<lb>
come, he said, real sober and impressive: `Wal, it come<lb>
through me, like a flash, that I 'd served the Lord as<lb>
faithful as I knew how for a number a years, and I<lb>
guessed He 'd fetch me through somehow, and He did.'<lb>
Sure enough the man warn't killed; I 'm bound to<lb>
confess he was shook dreadful, but his faith warn't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie could not help smiling at the story, but she<lb>
liked it, and sincerely wished she could imitate the<lb>
hero of it in his piety, not his powder. She was about<lb>
to say so when the sound of approaching steps announced<lb>
the advent of her host. She had been rather<lb>
impressed with the &ldquo;smartness&rdquo; of Lisha by his wife's<lb>
praises, but when a small, sallow, sickly looking man<lb>
came in she changed her mind; for not even an immensely<lb>
stiff collar, nor a pair of boots that seemed<lb>
composed entirely of what the boys call &ldquo;creak leather,&rdquo;<lb>
could inspire her with confidence.</p>
<p>Without a particle of expression in his yellow face,<lb>
Mr. Wilkins nodded to the stranger over the picket<lb>
<pb n="176">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-187">

<figdesc>Page 176.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fence of his collar, lighted his pipe, and clumped away<lb>
to enjoy his afternoon promenade without compromising<lb>
himself by a single word.</p>
<p>His wife looked after him with an admiring gaze as<lb>
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them boots is as good as an advertisement, for he<lb>
made every stitch on 'em himself;&rdquo; then she added,<lb>
laughing like a girl: &ldquo;It 's redick'lus my bein' so proud<lb>
of Lisha, but ef a woman ain't a right to think wal of<lb>
her own husband, I should like to know who has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie was afraid that Mrs. Wilkins had seen her<lb>
disappointment in her face, and tried, with wifely zeal,<lb>
to defend her lord from even a disparaging thought.<lb>
Wishing to atone for this transgression she was about<lb>
to sing the praises of the wooden-faced Elisha, but was<lb>
spared any polite fibs by the appearance of a small girl<lb>
who delivered an urgent message to the effect, that<lb>
&ldquo;Mis Plumly was down sick and wanted Mis Wilkins<lb>
to run over and set a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the good lady hesitated with an involuntary glance<lb>
at her guest, Christie said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't mind me; I 'll take care of the house for you<lb>
if you want to go. You may be sure I won't run off<lb>
with the children or steal the spoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain't a mite afraid of anybody wantin' to steal<lb>
them little toads; and as for spoons, I ain't got a silver<lb>
one to bless myself with,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Wilkins. &ldquo;I<lb>
guess I will go, then, ef you don't mind, as it 's only<lb>
acrost the street. Like 's not settin' quiet will be better<lb>
for you 'n talkin', for I 'm a dreadful hand to gab when<lb>
I git started. Tell Mis Plumly I 'm a comin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the child ran off, the stout lady began to<lb>
<pb n="177">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-188">

<figdesc>Page 177.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="8* L">
rummage in her closet, saying, as she rattled and<lb>
slammed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll jest take her a drawin' of tea and a couple of<lb>
nut-cakes: mebby she 'll relish 'em, for I shouldn't<lb>
wonder ef she hadn't had a mouthful this blessed day.<lb>
She 's dreadful slack at the best of times, but no one<lb>
can much wonder, seein' she 's got nine children, and<lb>
is jest up from a rheumatic fever. I 'm sure I never<lb>
grudge a meal of vittles or a hand's turn to such<lb>
as she is, though she does beat all for dependin' on<lb>
her neighbors. I 'm a thousand times obleeged. You<lb>
needn't werry about the children, only don't let 'em<lb>
git lost, or burnt, or pitch out a winder; and when<lb>
it 's done give 'em the patty-cake that's bakin' for'<lb>
em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which maternal orders Mrs. Wilkins assumed<lb>
a sky-blue bonnet, and went beaming away with several<lb>
dishes genteelly hidden under her purple shawl.</p>
<p>Being irresistibly attracted toward the children Christie<lb>
opened the door and took a survey of her responsibilities.<lb>
</p>
<p>Six lively infants were congregated in the &ldquo;settin'-room,&rdquo;<lb>
and chaos seemed to have come again, for every<lb>
sort of destructive amusement was in full operation.<lb>
George Washington, the eldest blossom, was shearing<lb>
a resigned kitten; Gusty and Ann Eliza were concocting<lb>
mud pies in the ashes; Adelaide Victoria was<lb>
studying the structure of lamp-wicks, while Daniel<lb>
Webster and Andrew Jackson were dragging one<lb>
another in a clothes-basket, to the great detriment of<lb>
the old carpet and still older chariot.</p>
<p>Thinking that some employment more suited to the<lb>
<pb n="178">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-189">

<figdesc>Page 178.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
day might be introduced, Christie soon made friends<lb>
with these young persons, and, having rescued the<lb>
kitten, banished the basket, lured the elder girls from<lb>
their mud-piety, and quenched the curiosity of the<lb>
Pickwickian Adelaide, she proposed teaching them<lb>
some little hymns.</p>
<p>The idea was graciously received, and the class decorously<lb>
seated in a row. But before a single verse was<lb>
given out, Gusty, being of a house-wifely turn of mind,<lb>
suggested that the patty-cake might burn. Instant<lb>
alarm pervaded the party, and a precipitate rush was<lb>
made for the cooking-stove, where Christie proved by<lb>
ocular demonstration that the cake showed no signs of<lb>
baking, much less of burning. The family pronounced<lb>
themselves satisfied, after each member had poked a<lb>
grimy little finger into the doughy delicacy, whereon<lb>
one large raisin reposed in proud pre-eminence over<lb>
the vulgar herd of caraways.</p>
<p>Order being with difficulty restored, Christie taught<lb>
her flock an appropriate hymn, and was flattering herself<lb>
that their youthful minds were receiving a devotional<lb>
bent, when they volunteered a song, and incited<lb>
thereunto by the irreverent Wash, burst forth with a<lb>
gem from Mother Goose, closing with a smart skirmish<lb>
of arms and legs that set all law and order at defiance.</p>
<p>Hoping to quell the insurrection Christie invited the<lb>
breathless rioters to calm themselves by looking at the<lb>
pictures in the big Bible. But, unfortunately, her explanations<lb>
were so vivid that her audience were fired with<lb>
a desire to enact some of the scenes portrayed, and no<lb>
persuasions could keep them from playing Ark on the<lb>
spot. The clothes-basket was elevated upon two<lb>
<pb n="179"><target id="p445-190">p445-190</target>

<head>Mrs. Wilkins' Six Lively Infants.</head>
<figdesc>445EAF. Page 179. In-line image of Mrs. Wilkins' children, who look like hedgehogs, all sitting in

</eaffig>
chairs, and into it marched the birds of the air and the<lb>
beasts of the field, to judge by the noise, and all set<lb>
sail, with Washington at the helm, Jackson and Webster<lb>
plying the clothes and pudding-sticks for oars, while<lb>
the young ladies rescued their dolls from the flood, and<lb>
waved their hands to imaginary friends who were not<lb>
unmindful of the courtesies of life even in the act of<lb>
drowning.</p>
<p>Finding her authority defied Christie left the rebels<lb>
to their own devices, and sitting in a corner, began to<lb>
<pb n="180">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-191">

<figdesc>Page 180.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
think about her own affairs. But before she had time<lb>
to get anxious or perplexed the children diverted her<lb>
mind, as if the little flibberty-gibbets knew that their<lb>
pranks and perils were far wholesomer for her just<lb>
then than brooding.</p>
<p>The much-enduring kitten being sent forth as a dove<lb>
upon the waters failed to return with the olive-branch;<lb>
of which peaceful emblem there was soon great need,<lb>
for mutiny broke out, and spread with disastrous rapidity.<lb>
</p>
<p>Ann Eliza slapped Gusty because she had the biggest<lb>
bandbox; Andrew threatened to &ldquo;chuck&rdquo; Daniel over-board<lb>
if he continued to trample on the fraternal toes,<lb>
and in the midst of the fray, by some unguarded<lb>
motion, Washington capsized the ship and precipitated<lb>
the patriarchal family into the bosom of the deep.</p>
<p>Christie flew to the rescue, and, hydropathically<lb>
treated, the anguish of bumps and bruises was soon<lb>
assuaged. Then appeared the appropriate moment for<lb>
a story, and gathering the dilapidated party about her<lb>
she soon enraptured them by a recital of the immortal<lb>
history of &ldquo;Frank and the little dog Trusty.&rdquo; Charmed<lb>
with her success she was about to tell another moral<lb>
tale, but no sooner had she announced the name, &ldquo;The<lb>
Three Cakes,&rdquo; when, like an electric flash a sudden<lb>
recollection seized the young Wilkinses, and with one<lb>
voice they demanded their lawful prize, sure that now<lb>
it must be done.</p>
<p>Christie had forgotten all about it, and was harassed<lb>
with secret misgivings as she headed the investigating<lb>
committee. With skipping of feet and clapping of<lb>
hands the eager tribe surrounded the stove, and with<lb>
<pb n="181">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-192">

<figdesc>Page 181.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fear and trembling Christie drew forth a melancholy<lb>
cinder, where, like Casabianca, the lofty raisin still<lb>
remained, blackened, but undaunted, at its post.</p>
<p>Then were six little vials of wrath poured out upon<lb>
her devoted head, and sounds of lamentation filled the<lb>
air, for the irate Wilkinses refused to be comforted till<lb>
the rash vow to present each member of the outraged<lb>
family with a private cake produced a lull, during<lb>
which the younger ones were decoyed into the back<lb>
yard, and the three elders solaced themselves with<lb>
mischief.</p>
<p>Mounted on mettlesome broomsticks Andrew and<lb>
Daniel were riding merrily away to the Banbury Cross,<lb>
of blessed memory, and little Vic was erecting a pagoda<lb>
of oyster-shells, under Christie's superintendence, when<lb>
a shrill scream from within sent horsemen and architects<lb>
flying to the rescue.</p>
<p>Gusty's pinafore was in a blaze; Ann Eliza was<lb>
dancing frantically about her sister as if bent on making<lb>
a <hi rend="italics">suttee</hi> of herself, while George Washington hung out<lb>
of window, roaring, &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; &ldquo;water!&rdquo; &ldquo;engine!&rdquo;<lb>
&ldquo;pa!&rdquo; with a presence of mind worthy of his sex.</p>
<p>A speedy application of the hearth-rug quenched the<lb>
conflagration, and when a minute burn had been enveloped<lb>
in cotton-wool, like a gem, a coroner sat upon the<lb>
pinafore and investigated the case.</p>
<p>It appeared that the ladies were &ldquo;only playing paper<lb>
dolls,&rdquo; when Wash, sighing for the enlightenment of his<lb>
race, proposed to make a bonfire, and did so with an<lb>
old book; but Gusty, with a firm belief in future punishment,<lb>
tried to save it, and fell a victim to her principles,<lb>
as the virtuous are very apt to do.</p>
<pb n="182">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-193">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The book was brought into court, and proved to be<lb>
an ancient volume of ballads, cut, torn, and half consumed.<lb>
Several peculiarly developed paper dolls,<lb>
branded here and there with large letters, like galley-slaves,<lb>
were then produced by the accused, and the<lb>
judge could with difficulty preserve her gravity when<lb>
she found &ldquo;John Gilpin&rdquo; converted into a painted<lb>
petticoat, &ldquo;The Bay of Biscay, O,&rdquo; situated in the<lb>
crown of a hat, and &ldquo;Chevy Chase&rdquo; issuing from the<lb>
mouth of a triangular gentleman, who, like Dickens's<lb>
cherub, probably sung it by ear, having no lungs to<lb>
speak of.</p>
<p>It was further apparent from the agricultural appearance<lb>
of the room that beans had been sowed broadcast<lb>
by means of the apple-corer, which Wash had converted<lb>
into a pop-gun with a mechanical ingenuity<lb>
worthy of more general appreciation. He felt this<lb>
deeply, and when Christie reproved him for leading his<lb>
sisters astray, he resented the liberty she took, and<lb>
retired in high dudgeon to the cellar, where he appeared<lb>
to set up a menagerie, &mdash; for bears, lions, and unknown<lb>
animals, endowed with great vocal powers, were heard<lb>
to solicit patronage from below.</p>
<p>Somewhat exhausted by her labors, Christie rested,<lb>
after clearing up the room, while the children found a<lb>
solace for all afflictions in the consumption of relays of<lb>
bread and molasses, which infantile restorative occurred<lb>
like an inspiration to the mind of their guardian.</p>
<p>Peace reigned for fifteen minutes; then came a loud<lb>
crash from the cellar, followed by a violent splashing,<lb>
and wild cries of, &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh, I 've fell into the pork<lb>
barrel! I 'm drownin', I 'm drownin'!&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>Down rushed Christie, and the sticky innocents ran<lb>
screaming after, to behold their pickled brother fished<lb>
up from the briny deep. A spectacle well calculated<lb>
to impress upon their infant minds the awful consequences<lb>
of straying from the paths of virtue.</p>
<p>At this crisis Mrs. Wilkins providentially appeared,<lb>
breathless, but brisk and beaming, and in no wise dismayed<lb>
by the plight of her luckless son, for a ten years'<lb>
acquaintance with Wash's dauntless nature had inured<lb>
his mother to &ldquo;didoes&rdquo; that would have appalled most<lb>
women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right up chamber, and change every rag on you,<lb>
and don't come down agin till I rap on the ceilin'; you<lb>
dreadful boy, disgracin' your family by sech actions.<lb>
I 'm sorry I was kep' so long, but Mis Plumly got tellin'<lb>
her werryments, and 'peared to take so much comfort<lb>
in it I couldn't bear to stop her. Then I jest run<lb>
round to your place and told that woman that you was<lb>
safe and well, along 'r friends, and would call in to-morrer<lb>
to get your things. She 'd ben so scart by<lb>
your not comin' home that she was as mild as milk, so<lb>
you won't have no trouble with her, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much! How kind you are, and<lb>
how tired you must be! Sit down and let me take<lb>
your things,&rdquo; cried Christie, more relieved than she<lb>
could express.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor', no, I 'm fond of walkin', but bein' ruther hefty<lb>
it takes my breath away some to hurry. I 'm afraid<lb>
these children have tuckered you out though. They<lb>
are proper good gen'lly, but when they do take to<lb>
trainen they 're a sight of care,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, as<lb>
she surveyed her imposing bonnet with calm satisfaction.<lb>
</p>
<pb n="184">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-195">

<figdesc>Page 184.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 've enjoyed it very much, and it 's done me good,<lb>
for I haven't laughed so much for six months as I have<lb>
this afternoon,&rdquo; answered Christie, and it was quite<lb>
true, for she had been too busy to think of herself or<lb>
her woes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I thought likely it would chirk you up some,<lb>
or I shouldn't have went,&rdquo; and Mrs. Wilkins put away<lb>
a contented smile with her cherished bonnet, for Christie's<lb>
face had grown so much brighter since she saw it<lb>
last, that the good woman felt sure her treatment was<lb>
the right one.</p>
<p>At supper Lisha reappeared, and while his wife and<lb>
children talked incessantly, he ate four slices of bread<lb>
and butter, three pieces of pie, five dough-nuts, and<lb>
drank a small ocean of tea out of his saucer. Then,<lb>
evidently feeling that he had done his duty like a man,<lb>
he gave Christie another nod, and disappeared again<lb>
without a word.</p>
<p>When she had done up her dishes Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
brought out a few books and papers, and said to Christie,<lb>
who sat apart by the window, with the old shadow<lb>
creeping over her face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don't feel lonesome, my dear, but jest lop<lb>
right down on the soffy and have a sociable kind of a<lb>
time. Lisha 's gone down street for the evenin'. I 'll<lb>
keep the children as quiet as one woman can, and you<lb>
may read or rest, or talk, jest as you 're a mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; I 'll sit here and rock little Vic to<lb>
sleep for you. I don't care to read, but I 'd like to<lb>
have you talk to me, for it seems as if I 'd known you<lb>
a long time and it does me good,&rdquo; said Christie, as she<lb>
settled herself and baby on the old settee which had<lb>
<pb n="185">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-196">

<figdesc>Page 185.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
served as a cradle for six young Wilkinses, and now<lb>
received the honorable name of sofa in its old age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins looked gratified, as she settled her<lb>
brood round the table with a pile of pictorial papers to<lb>
amuse them. Then having laid herself out to be<lb>
agreeable, she sat thoughtfully rubbing the bridge of<lb>
her nose, at a loss how to begin. Presently Christie<lb>
helped her by an involuntary sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What 's the matter, dear? Is there any thing I can<lb>
do to make you comfortable?&rdquo; asked the kind soul,<lb>
alert at once, and ready to offer sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm very cosy, thank you, and I don't know why I<lb>
sighed. It 's a way I 've got into when I think of my<lb>
worries,&rdquo; explained Christie, in haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, dear, I wouldn't ef I was you. Don't keep<lb>
turnin' your troubles over. Git atop of 'em somehow,<lb>
and stay there ef you can,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, very<lb>
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that 's just what I can't do. I 've lost all my<lb>
spirits and courage, and got into a dismal state of mind.<lb>
You seem to be very cheerful, and yet you must have<lb>
a good deal to try you sometimes. I wish you 'd tell<lb>
me how you do it;&rdquo; and Christie looked wistfully into<lb>
that other face, so plain, yet so placid, wondering to<lb>
see how little poverty, hard work, and many cares had<lb>
soured or saddened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really I don't know, unless it 's jest doin' whatever<lb>
comes along, and doin' of it hearty, sure that things<lb>
is all right, though very often I don't see it at fust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see it at last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gen'lly I do; and if I don't I take it on trust, same<lb>
as children do what older folks tell 'em; and byme-by<lb>
<pb n="186">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-197">

<figdesc>Page 186.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
when I 'm grown up in spiritual things I 'll understan'<lb>
as the dears do, when they git to be men and women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That suited Christie, and she thought hopefully<lb>
within herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This woman has got the sort of religion I want, if<lb>
it makes her what she is. Some day I 'll get her to tell<lb>
me where she found it.&rdquo; Then aloud she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it 's <hi rend="italics">so</hi> hard to be patient and contented when<lb>
nothing happens as you want it to, and you don't get<lb>
your share of happiness, no matter how much you try<lb>
to deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain't easy to bear, I know, but having tried<lb>
my own way and made a dreadful mess on 't, I concluded<lb>
that the Lord knows what 's best for us, and<lb>
things go better when He manages than when we go<lb>
scratchin' round and can't wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried your own way? How do you mean?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Christie, curiously; for she liked to hear her hostess<lb>
talk, and found something besides amusement in the<lb>
conversation, which seemed to possess a fresh country<lb>
flavor as well as country phrases.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins smiled all over her plump face, as if<lb>
she liked to tell her experience, and having hunched<lb>
sleepy little Andy more comfortably into her lap, and<lb>
given a preparatory hem or two, she began with great<lb>
good-will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened a number a years ago and ain't much<lb>
of a story any way. But you 're welcome to it, as some<lb>
of it is rather humorsome, the laugh may do you good<lb>
ef the story don't. We was livin' down to the east'ard<lb>
at the time. It was a real pretty place; the house<lb>
stood under a couple of maples and a gret brook come<lb>
<pb n="187">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-198">

<figdesc>Page 187.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
foamin' down the rayvine and away through the medders<lb>
to the river. Dear sakes, seems as ef I see it now,<lb>
jest as I used to settin' on the doorsteps with the laylocks<lb>
all in blow, the squirrels jabberin' on the wall,<lb>
and the saw-mill screekin' way off by the dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing a moment, Mrs. Wilkins looked musingly at<lb>
the steam of the tea-kettle, as if through its silvery<lb>
haze she saw her early home again. Wash promptly<lb>
roused her from this reverie by tumbling off the boiler<lb>
with a crash. His mother picked him up and placidly<lb>
went on, falling more and more into the country dialect<lb>
which city life had not yet polished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I oughter hev been the contentedest woman alive,<lb>
but I warn't, for you see I 'd worked at millineryin'<lb>
before I was married, and had an easy time on't,<lb>
Afterwards the children come along pretty fast, there<lb>
was sights of work to do, and no time for pleasurin',<lb>
so I got wore out, and used to hanker after old times<lb>
in a dreadful wicked way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally I got acquainted with a Mis Bascum, and<lb>
she done me a sight of harm. You see, havin' few pies<lb>
of her own to bake, she was fond of puttin' her fingers<lb>
into her neighborses, but she done it so neat that no<lb>
one mistrusted she was takin' all the sarce and leavin'<lb>
all the crust to them, as you may say. Wal, I told her<lb>
my werryments and she sympathized real hearty, and<lb>
said I didn't ought to stan' it, but have things to suit<lb>
me, and enjoy myself, as other folks did. So when she<lb>
put it into my head I thought it amazin' good advice,<lb>
and jest went and done as she told me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lisha was the kindest man you ever see, so when I<lb>
up and said I warn't goin' to drudge round no more,<lb>
<pb n="188">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-199">

<figdesc>Page 188.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
but must hev a girl, he got one, and goodness knows<lb>
what a trial <hi rend="italics">she</hi> was. After she came I got dreadful<lb>
slack, and left the house and the children to Hen'retta,<lb>
and went pleasurin' frequent all in my best. I always<lb>
<hi rend="italics">was</hi> a dressy woman in them days, and Lisha give me<lb>
his earnin's real lavish, bless his heart! and I went and<lb>
spent 'em on my sinful gowns and bunnets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Wilkins stopped to give a remorseful groan<lb>
and stroke her faded dress, as if she found great comfort<lb>
in its dinginess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain't no use tellin' all I done, but I had full swing,<lb>
and at fust I thought luck was in my dish sure. But it<lb>
warn't, seein' I didn't deserve it, and I had to take my<lb>
mess of trouble, which was needful and nourishin,' ef<lb>
I 'd had the grace to see it so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lisha got into debt, and no wonder, with me a<lb>
wastin' of his substance; Hen'retta went off suddin',<lb>
with whatever she could lay her hands on, and everything<lb>
was at sixes and sevens. Lisha's patience give<lb>
out at last, for I was dreadful fractious, knowin' it was<lb>
all my fault. The children seemed to git out of sorts,<lb>
too, and acted like time in the primer, with croup and<lb>
pins, and whoopin'-cough and temper. I declare I<lb>
used to think the pots and kettles biled over to spite<lb>
each other and me too in them days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this was nuts to Mis Bascum, and she kep'<lb>
advisin' and encouragin' of me, and I didn 't see through<lb>
her a mite, or guess that settin' folks by the ears was<lb>
as relishin' to her as bitters is to some. Merciful, suz!<lb>
what a piece a work we did make betwixt us! I<lb>
scolded and moped 'cause I couldn't have my way;<lb>
Lisha swore and threatened to take to drinkin' ef I<lb>
<pb n="189">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-200">

<figdesc>Page 189.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
didn't make home more comfortable; the children run<lb>
wild, and the house was gittin' too hot to hold us,<lb>
when we was brought up with a round turn, and I see<lb>
the redicklousness of my doin's in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day Lisha come home tired and cross, for bills<lb>
was pressin', work slack, and folks talkin' about us as<lb>
ef they 'd nothin' else to do. I was dishin' up dinner,<lb>
feelin' as nervous as a witch, for a whole batch of<lb>
bread had burnt to a cinder while I was trimmin' a new<lb>
bunnet, Wash had scart me most to death swallerin' a<lb>
cent, and the steak had been on the floor more'n once,<lb>
owin' to my havin' babies, dogs, cats, or hens under<lb>
my feet the whole blessed time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lisha looked as black as thunder, throwed his hat<lb>
into a corner, and came along to the sink where I was<lb>
skinnin' pertaters. As he washed his hands, I asked<lb>
what the matter was; but he only muttered and<lb>
slopped, and I couldn't git nothin' out of him, for he<lb>
ain't talkative at the best of times as you see, and when<lb>
he 's werried corkscrews wouldn't draw a word from<lb>
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bein' riled myself didn't mend matters, and so we<lb>
fell to hectorin' one another right smart. He said<lb>
somethin' that dreened my last drop of patience; I<lb>
give a sharp answer, and fust thing I knew he up with<lb>
his hand and slapped me. It warn't a hard blow by<lb>
no means, only a kind of a wet spat side of the head;<lb>
but I thought I should have flew, and was as mad as ef<lb>
I 'd been knocked down. You never see a man look so'<lb>
shamed as Lisha did, and ef I 'd been wise I should<lb>
have made up the quarrel then. But I was a fool. I<lb>
jest flung fork, dish, pertaters and all into the pot, and<lb>
says, as ferce as you please:</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;`'Lisha Wilkins, when you can treat me decent you<lb>
may come and fetch me back; you won't see me till<lb>
then, and so I tell you.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I made a bee-line for Mis Bascum's; told her<lb>
the whole story, had a good cry, and was all ready to<lb>
go home in half an hour, but Lisha didn't come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, that night passed, and what a long one it was<lb>
to be sure! and me without a wink of sleep, thinkin' of<lb>
Wash and the cent, my emptins and the baby. Next<lb>
day come, but no Lisha, no message, no nuthin', and I<lb>
began to think I'd got my match though I had a sight<lb>
of grit in them days. I sewed, and Mis Bascum she<lb>
clacked; but I didn't say much, and jest worked like<lb>
sixty to pay for my keep, for I warn't goin' to be<lb>
beholden to her for nothin'.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day dragged on terrible slow, and at last I<lb>
begged her to go and git me a clean dress, for I'd come<lb>
off jest as I was, and folks kep' droppin' in, for the<lb>
story was all round, thanks to Mis Bascum's long<lb>
tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, she went, and ef you'll believe me Lisha<lb>
wouldn't let her in! He handed my best things out a<lb>
winder and told her to tell me they were gittin' along<lb>
fust rate with Florindy Walch to do the work. He<lb>
hoped I'd have a good time, and not expect him for a<lb>
consider'ble spell, for he liked a quiet house, and now<lb>
he'd got it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard that, I knew he must be provoked<lb>
the wust kind, for he ain't a hash man by nater. I<lb>
could have crep' in at the winder ef he wouldn't open<lb>
the door, I was so took down by that message. But<lb>
Mis Bascum wouldn't hear of it, and kep' stirrin' of<lb>

</eaffig>
me up till I was ashamed to eat 'umble pie fust; so I<lb>
waited to see how soon he'd come round. But he had<lb>
the best on't you see, for he'd got the babies and lost a<lb>
cross wife, while I'd lost every thing but Mis Bascum,<lb>
who grew hatefuler to me every hour, for I begun to<lb>
mistrust she was a mischief-maker, &mdash; widders most<lb>
always is, &mdash; seein' how she pampered up my pride and'<lb>
peared to like the quarrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I should have died more'n once, for sure<lb>
as you live it went on three mortal days, and of all<lb>
miser'ble creeters I was the miser'blest. Then I see<lb>
how wicked and ungrateful I'd been; how I'd shirked<lb>
my bounden duty and scorned my best blessins.<lb>
There warn't a hard job that ever I'd hated but what<lb>
grew easy when I remembered who it was done for;<lb>
there warn't a trouble or a care that I wouldn't have<lb>
welcomed hearty, nor one hour of them dear fractious<lb>
babies that didn't seem precious when I'd gone and<lb>
left 'em. I'd got time to rest enough now, and might go<lb>
pleasuring all day long; but I couldn't do it, and would<lb>
have given a dozin bunnets trimmed to kill ef I could<lb>
only have been back moilin' in my old kitchen with<lb>
the children hangin' round me and Lisha a comin' in<lb>
cheerful from his work as he used to 'fore I spoilt his<lb>
home for him. How sing'lar it is folks never <hi rend="italics">do</hi> know<lb>
when they are wal off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it now,&rdquo; said Christie, rocking lazily to and<lb>
fro, with a face almost as tranquil as little Vic's, lying<lb>
half asleep in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it, my dear. As I was goin' on to say,<lb>
when Saturday come, a tremenjus storm set in, and it<lb>
rained guns all day. I never shall forgit it, for I was<lb>
<pb n="192">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-203">

<figdesc>Page 192.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hankerin' after baby, and dreadful werried about the<lb>
others, all bein' croupy, and Florindy with no more<lb>
idee of nussin' than a baa lamb. The rain come down<lb>
like a reg'lar deluge, but I didn't seem to have no ark<lb>
to run to. As night come on things got wuss and wuss,<lb>
for the wind blowed the roof off Mis Bascum's barn<lb>
and stove in the butt'ry window; the brook riz and<lb>
went ragin' every which way, and you never did see<lb>
such a piece of work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart was most broke by that time, and I knew<lb>
I should give in 'fore Monday. But I set and sewed and<lb>
listened to the tinkle tankle of the drops in the pans set<lb>
round to ketch 'em, for the house leaked like a sieve.<lb>
Mis Bascum was down suller putterin' about, for every<lb>
kag and sarce jar was afloat. Moses, her brother, was<lb>
lookin' after his stock and tryin' to stop the damage.<lb>
All of a sudden he bust in lookin' kinder wild, and<lb>
settin' down the lantern, he sez, sez he: `You're<lb>
ruthern an unfortinate woman to-night, Mis Wilkins.'<lb>
`How so?' sez I, as ef nuthin' was the matter already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Why,' sez he, `the spilins have give way up in the<lb>
rayvine, and the brook's come down like a river, upsot<lb>
your lean-to, washed the mellion patch slap into the<lb>
road, and while your husband was tryin' to git the pig<lb>
out of the pen, the water took a turn and swep him<lb>
away.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Drownded?' sez I, with only breath enough for that<lb>
one word. `Shouldn't wonder,' sez Moses, `nothin'<lb>
ever did come up alive after goin' over them falls.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;It come over me like a streak of lightenin'; every<lb>
thin' kinder slewed round, and I dropped in the first<lb>
faint I ever had in my life. Next I knew Lisha was<lb>

<figdesc>Page 193.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="9 I">
holdin' of me and cryin' fit to kill himself. I thought<lb>
I was dreamin', and only had wits enough to give a sort<lb>
of permiscuous grab at him and call out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Oh, Lisha! ain't you drownded?' He give a gret<lb>
start at that, swallered down his sobbin', and sez as<lb>
lovin' as ever a man did in this world:</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Bless your dear heart, Cynthy, it warn't me it was<lb>
the pig;' and then fell to kissin' of me, till betwixt<lb>
laughin' and cryin' I was most choked. Deary me, it<lb>
all comes back so livin' real it kinder takes my breath<lb>
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And well it might, for the good soul entered so<lb>
heartily into her story that she unconsciously embellished<lb>
it with dramatic illustrations. At the slapping<lb>
episode she flung an invisible &ldquo;fork, dish, and pertaters&rdquo;<lb>
into an imaginary kettle, and glared; when the<lb>
catastrophe arrived, she fell back upon her chair to express<lb>
fainting; gave Christie's arm the &ldquo;permiscuous<lb>
grab&rdquo; at the proper moment, and uttered the repentant<lb>
Lisha's explanation with an incoherent pathos that<lb>
forbid a laugh at the sudden introduction of the porcine<lb>
martyr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo; asked Christie in a most<lb>
flattering state of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, law! I went right home and hugged them<lb>
children for a couple of hours stiddy,&rdquo; answered Mrs.<lb>
Wilkins, as if but one conclusion was possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did all your troubles go down with the pig?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Christie, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massy, no, we're all poor, feeble worms, and the<lb>
best meanin' of us fails too often,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Wilkins,<lb>
as she tenderly adjusted the sleepy head of the young<lb>
<pb n="194">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-205">

<figdesc>Page 194.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
worm in her lap. &ldquo;After that scrape I done my best;<lb>
Lisha was as meek as a whole flock of sheep, and we<lb>
give Mis Bascum a wide berth. Things went lovely for<lb>
ever so long, and though, after a spell, we had our ups<lb>
and downs, as is but natural to human creeters, we<lb>
never come to such a pass agin. Both on us tried<lb>
real hard; whenever I felt my temper risin' or discontent<lb>
comin' on I remembered them days and kep' a<lb>
taut rein; and as for Lisha he never said a raspin'<lb>
word, or got sulky, but what he'd bust out laughin'<lb>
after it and say: `Bless you, Cynthy, it warn't me, it<lb>
was the pig.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins' hearty laugh fired a long train of lesser<lb>
ones, for the children recognized a household word.<lb>
Christie enjoyed the joke, and even the tea-kettle<lb>
boiled over as if carried away by the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell some more, please,&rdquo; said Christie, when the<lb>
merriment subsided, for she felt her spirits rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's nothin' more to tell, except one thing that<lb>
prevented my ever forgittin' the lesson I got then. My<lb>
little Almiry took cold that week and pined away<lb>
rapid. She'd always been so ailin' I never expected to<lb>
raise her, and more'n once in them sinful tempers of<lb>
mine I'd thought it would be a mercy ef she was took<lb>
out of her pain. But when I laid away that patient,<lb>
sufferin' little creeter I found she was the dearest of'<lb>
em all. I most broke my heart to hev her back, and<lb>
never, never forgive myself for leavin' her that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With trembling lips and full eyes Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
stopped to wipe her features generally on Andrew<lb>
Jackson's pinafore, and heave a remorseful sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is how you came to be the cheerful,<lb>
<pb n="195">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-206">

<figdesc>Page 195.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
contented woman you are?&rdquo; said Christie, hoping to<lb>
divert the mother's mind from that too tender memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I told you Lisha<lb>
was a smart man; he give me a good lesson, and it set<lb>
me to thinkin' serious. 'Pears to me trouble is a kind<lb>
of mellerin' process, and ef you take it kindly it doos<lb>
you good, and you learn to be glad of it. I 'm sure Lisha<lb>
and me is twice as fond of one another, twice as<lb>
willin' to work, and twice as patient with our trials<lb>
sense dear little Almiry died, and times was hard.<lb>
I ain't what I ought to be, not by a long chalk, but I<lb>
try to live up to my light, do my duty cheerful, love<lb>
my neighbors, and fetch up my family in the fear of<lb>
God. Ef I do this the best way I know how, I 'm sure<lb>
I 'll get my rest some day, and the good Lord won't<lb>
forgit Cynthy Wilkins. He ain't so fur, for I keep my<lb>
health wonderfle, Lisha is kind and stiddy, the children<lb>
flourishin', and I 'm a happy woman though I be a humly<lb>
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There she was mistaken, for as her eye roved round<lb>
the narrow room from the old hat on the wall to the<lb>
curly heads bobbing here and there, contentment,<lb>
piety, and mother-love made her plain face beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That story has done me ever so much good, and I<lb>
shall not forget it. Now, good-night, for I must be up<lb>
early to-morrow, and I don't want to drive Mr. Wilkins<lb>
away entirely,&rdquo; said Christie, after she had helped put<lb>
the little folk to bed, during which process she had<lb>
heard her host creaking about the kitchen as if afraid<lb>
to enter the sitting-room.</p>
<p>She laughed as she spoke, and ran up stairs, wondering<lb>
if she could be the same forlorn creature who had<lb>
crept so wearily up only the night before.</p>

</p>
<p>It was a very humble little sermon that Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
had preached to her, but she took it to heart and<lb>
profited by it; for she was a pupil in the great charity<lb>
school where the best teachers are often unknown, unhonored<lb>
here, but who surely will receive commendation<lb>
and reward from the head master when their long vacation<lb>
comes.</p>

<p>NEXT day Christie braved the lion in his den,<lb>
otherwise the flinty Flint, in her second-class<lb>
boarding-house, and found that alarm and remorse had<lb>
produced a softening effect upon her. She was unfeignedly<lb>
glad to see her lost lodger safe, and finding that<lb>
the new friends were likely to put her in the way of<lb>
paying her debts, this much harassed matron permitted<lb>
her to pack up her possessions, leaving one trunk as a<lb>
sort of hostage. Then, with promises to redeem it as<lb>
<pb n="198">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-209">

<figdesc>Page 198.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
soon as possible, Christie said good-bye to the little<lb>
room where she had hoped and suffered, lived and<lb>
labored so long, and went joyfully back to the humble<lb>
home she had found with the good laundress.</p>
<p>All the following week Christie &ldquo;chored round,&rdquo; as<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins called the miscellaneous light work she<lb>
let her do. Much washing, combing, and clean pinaforing<lb>
of children fell to her share, and she enjoyed it<lb>
amazingly; then, when the elder ones were packed off<lb>
to school she lent a hand to any of the numberless<lb>
tasks housewives find to do from morning till night.<lb>
In the afternoon, when other work was done, and little<lb>
Vic asleep or happy with her playthings, Christie<lb>
clapped laces, sprinkled muslins, and picked out edgings<lb>
at the great table where Mrs. Wilkins stood<lb>
ironing, fluting, and crimping till the kitchen bristled<lb>
all over with immaculate frills and flounces.</p>
<p>It was pretty delicate work, and Christie liked it, for<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins was an adept at her trade and took as<lb>
much pride and pleasure in it as any French <hi rend="italics">blanchisseuse</hi><lb>
tripping through the streets of Paris with a tree<lb>
full of coquettish caps, capes, and petticoats borne<lb>
before her by a half invisible boy.</p>
<p>Being women, of course they talked as industriously<lb>
as they worked; fingers flew and tongues clacked with<lb>
equal profit and pleasure, and, by Saturday, Christie<lb>
had made up her mind that Mrs. Wilkins was the most<lb>
sensible woman she ever knew. Her grammar was an<lb>
outrage upon the memory of Lindley Murray, but the<lb>
goodness of her heart would have done honor to any<lb>
saint in the calendar. She was very plain, and her<lb>
manners were by no means elegant, but good temper<lb>
<pb n="199">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-210">

<figdesc>Page 199.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
made that homely face most lovable, and natural refinement<lb>
of soul made mere external polish of small<lb>
account. Her shrewd ideas and odd sayings amused<lb>
Christie very much, while her good sense and bright<lb>
way of looking at things did the younger woman a<lb>
world of good.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins devoted himself to the making of shoes<lb>
and the consumption of food, with the silent regularity<lb>
of a placid animal. His one dissipation was tobacco,<lb>
and in a fragrant cloud of smoke he lived and moved<lb>
and had his being so entirely that he might have been<lb>
described as a pipe with a man somewhere behind it.<lb>
Christie once laughingly spoke of this habit and declared<lb>
she would try it herself if she thought it would<lb>
make her as quiet and undemonstrative as Mr. Wilkins,<lb>
who, to tell the truth, made no more impression on her<lb>
than a fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't approve on 't, but he might do wuss. We<lb>
all have to have our comfort somehow, so I let Lisha<lb>
smoke as much as he likes, and he lets me gab, so it 's<lb>
about fair, I reckon,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Wilkins, from the<lb>
suds.</p>
<p>She laughed as she spoke, but something in her face<lb>
made Christie suspect that at some period of his life<lb>
Lisha had done &ldquo;wuss;&rdquo; and subsequent observations<lb>
confirmed this suspicion and another one also, &mdash; that<lb>
his good wife had saved him, and was gently easing<lb>
him back to self-control and self-respect. But, as old<lb>
Fuller quaintly says, &ldquo;She so gently folded up his<lb>
faults in silence that few guessed them,&rdquo; and loyally<lb>
paid him that respect which she desired others to<lb>
bestow. It was always &ldquo;Lisha and me,&rdquo; &ldquo;I 'll ask my<lb>
<pb n="200">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-211">

<figdesc>Page 200.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
husband&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lisha 'll know; he don't say much, but<lb>
he 's a dreadful smart man,&rdquo; and she kept up the fiction<lb>
so dear to her wifely soul by endowing him with her<lb>
own virtues, and giving him the credit of her own<lb>
intelligence.</p>
<p>Christie loved her all the better for this devotion,<lb>
and for her sake treated Mr. Wilkins as if he possessed<lb>
the strength of Samson and the wisdom of Solomon.<lb>
He received her respect as if it was his due, and now<lb>
and then graciously accorded her a few words beyond<lb>
the usual scanty allowance of morning and evening<lb>
greetings. At his shop all day, she only saw him at<lb>
meals and sometimes of an evening, for Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
tried to keep him at home safe from temptation, and<lb>
Christie helped her by reading, talking, and frolicking<lb>
with the children, so that he might find home attractive.<lb>
He loved his babies and would even relinquish<lb>
his precious pipe for a time to ride the little chaps on<lb>
his foot, or amuse Vic with shadow rabbits on the<lb>
wall.</p>
<p>At such times the entire content in Mrs. Wilkins's<lb>
face made tobacco fumes endurable, and the burden of<lb>
a dull man's presence less oppressive to Christie, who<lb>
loved to pay her debts in something besides money.</p>
<p>As they sat together finishing off some delicate laces<lb>
that Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Wilkins said, &ldquo;Ef it 's<lb>
fair to-morrow I want you to go to my meetin' and<lb>
hear my minister. It 'll do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie looked rather startled, for she had heard of<lb>
Thomas Power as a rampant radical and infidel of the<lb>
<pb n="201">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-212">

<figdesc>Page 201.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="9*">
deepest dye, and been warned never to visit that den<lb>
of iniquity called his free church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Wilkins, you don't mean it!&rdquo; she said,<lb>
leaving her lace to dry at the most critical stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; answered Mrs. Wilkins, setting down<lb>
her flat-iron with emphasis, and evidently preparing to<lb>
fight valiantly for her minister, as most women will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon; I was a little surprised, for I 'd<lb>
heard all sorts of things about him,&rdquo; Christie hastened<lb>
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear <hi rend="italics">him,</hi> or read any of his writins?&rdquo;<lb>
demanded Mrs. Wilkins, with a calmer air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don't judge. You go hear and see that<lb>
blessed man, and ef you don't say he 's the shadder of<lb>
a great rock in a desert land, I 'll give up,&rdquo; cried the<lb>
good woman, waxing poetical in her warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will to please you, if nothing else. I did go once<lb>
just because I was told not to; but he did not preach<lb>
that day and every thing was so peculiar, I didn't know<lb>
whether to like it or be shocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is kind of sing'lar at fust, I 'm free to confess,<lb>
and not as churchy as some folks like. But there<lb>
ain't no place but that big enough to hold the crowds<lb>
that want to go, for the more he 's abused the more<lb>
folks flock to see him. They git their money's wuth I<lb>
do believe, for though there ain't no pulpits and pews,<lb>
there 's a sight of brotherly love round in them seats,<lb>
and pious practice, as well as powerful preaching, in<lb>
that shabby desk. <hi rend="italics">He</hi> don't need no commandments<lb>
painted up behind him to read on Sunday, for he keeps<lb>

<figdesc>Page 202.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
'em in his heart and life all the week as honest as man<lb>
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There Mrs. Wilkins paused, flushed and breathless<lb>
with her defence, and Christie said, candidly: &ldquo;I did<lb>
like the freedom and good-will there, for people sat<lb>
where they liked, and no one frowned over shut pewdoors,<lb>
at me a stranger. An old black woman sat next<lb>
me, and said `Amen' when she liked what she heard,<lb>
and a very shabby young man was on the other, listening<lb>
as if his soul was as hungry as his body. People<lb>
read books, laughed and cried, clapped when pleased,<lb>
and hissed when angry; that I did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more does Mr. Power; he don't mind the cryin'<lb>
and the smilin' as it 's nat'ral, but noise and disrespect<lb>
of no kind ain't pleasin' to him. His own folks behave<lb>
becomin', but strangers go and act as they like, thinkin'<lb>
that there ain't no bounds to the word free. Then<lb>
we are picked at for their doin's, and Mr. Power has to<lb>
carry other folkses' sins on his shoulders. But, dear<lb>
suz, it ain't much matter after all, ef the souls is well-meanin'.<lb>
Children always make a noise a strivin' after<lb>
what they want most, and I shouldn't wonder ef the<lb>
Lord forgive all our short-comin's of that sort, sense<lb>
we are hankerin' and reachin' for the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I <hi rend="italics">had</hi> heard Mr. Power that day, for I was<lb>
striving after peace with all my heart, and he might<lb>
have given it to me,&rdquo; said Christie, interested and impressed<lb>
with what she heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, no, dear, I guess not. Peace ain't give to no<lb>
one all of a suddin, it gen'lly comes through much<lb>
tribulation, and the sort that comes hardest is best<lb>
wuth havin'. Mr. Power would a' ploughed and<lb>
<pb n="203">

<figdesc>Page 203.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
harrered you, so to speak, and sowed good seed liberal;<lb>
then ef you warn't barren ground things would have<lb>
throve, and the Lord give you a harvest accordin' to<lb>
your labor. Who did you hear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Wilkins,<lb>
pausing to starch and clap vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very young man who seemed to be airing his<lb>
ideas and beliefs in the frankest manner. He belabored<lb>
everybody and every thing, upset church and state,<lb>
called names, arranged heaven and earth to suit himself,<lb>
and evidently meant every word he said. Much<lb>
of it would have been ridiculous if the boy had not<lb>
been so thoroughly in earnest; sincerity always commands<lb>
respect, and though people smiled, they liked<lb>
his courage, and seemed to think he would make a man<lb>
when his spiritual wild oats were sown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain't a doubt on 't. We often have such, and<lb>
they ain't all empty talk, nuther; some of 'em are surprisingly<lb>
bright, and all mean so well I don't never<lb>
reluct to hear 'em. They must blow off their steam<lb>
somewheres, else they 'd bust with the big idees a<lb>
swellin' in 'em; Mr. Power knows it and gives 'em the<lb>
chance they can't find nowheres else. 'Pears to me,&rdquo;<lb>
added Mrs. Wilkins, ironing rapidly as she spoke, &ldquo;that<lb>
folks is very like clothes, and a sight has to be done to<lb>
keep 'em clean and whole. All on us has to lend a<lb>
hand in this dreadful mixed-up wash, and each do our<lb>
part, same as you and me is now. There 's scrubbin'<lb>
and bilin', wrenchin' and bluein', dryin' and foldin',<lb>
ironin' and polishin', before any of us is fit for wear a<lb>
Sunday mornin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part does Mr. Power do?&rdquo; asked Christie,<lb>
much amused at this peculiarly appropriate simile.</p>
<pb n="204">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-215">

<figdesc>Page 204.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scrubbin' and the bilin'; that 's always the<lb>
hardest and the hottest part. He starts the dirt and<lb>
gits the stains out, and leaves 'em ready for other folks<lb>
to finish off. It ain't such pleasant work as hangin'<lb>
out, or such pretty work as doin' up, but some one's<lb>
got to do it, and them that 's strongest does it best,<lb>
though they don't git half so much credit as them as<lb>
polishes and crimps. That 's showy work, but it<lb>
wouldn't be no use ef the things warn't well washed<lb>
fust,&rdquo; and Mrs. Wilkins thoughtfully surveyed the<lb>
snowy muslin cap, with its border fluted like the petals<lb>
of a prim white daisy, that hung on her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd like to be a washerwoman of that sort; but as<lb>
I 'm not one of the strong, I 'll be a laundress, and try<lb>
to make purity as attractive as you do,&rdquo; said Christie,<lb>
soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, it 's warm and wearin' work I do<lb>
assure you, and hard to give satisfaction, try as you<lb>
may. Crowns of glory ain't wore in this world, but<lb>
it 's my 'pinion that them that does the hard jobs here<lb>
will stand a good chance of havin' extra bright ones<lb>
when they git through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know <hi rend="italics">you</hi> will,&rdquo; said Christie, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land alive, child! I warn't thinking of Cynthy<lb>
Wilkins, but Mr. Power. I 'll be satisfied ef I can set<lb>
low down somewheres and see him git the meddle.<lb>
He won't in this world, but I know there 's rewards<lb>
savin' up for him byme-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll go to-morrow if it pours!&rdquo; said Christie, with<lb>
decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, and I 'll lend you my bunnit,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wilkins,<lb>
passing, with comical rapidity, from crowns of<lb>
glory to her own cherished head-gear.</p>
<pb n="205">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-216">

<figdesc>Page 205.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I can't wear blue, I look as yellow<lb>
as a dandelion in it. Mrs. Flint let me have my best<lb>
things though I offered to leave them, so I shall be<lb>
respectable and by-and-by blossom out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow Christie went early, got a good seat,<lb>
and for half an hour watched the gathering of the<lb>
motley congregation that filled the great hall. Some<lb>
came in timidly, as if doubtful of their welcome; some<lb>
noisily, as if, as Mrs. Wilkins said, they had not learned<lb>
the wide difference between liberty and license; many<lb>
as if eager and curious; and a large number with the<lb>
look of children gathering round a family table ready<lb>
to be fed, and sure that wholesome food would be<lb>
bountifully provided for them.</p>
<p>Christie was struck by the large proportion of young<lb>
people in the place, of all classes, both sexes, and<lb>
strongly contrasting faces. Delicate girls looking with<lb>
the sweet wistfulness of maidenly hearts for something<lb>
strong to lean upon and love; sad-eyed women turning<lb>
to heaven for the consolations or the satisfactions earth<lb>
could not give them; anxious mothers perplexed with<lb>
many cares, trying to find light and strength; young<lb>
men with ardent faces, restless, aspiring, and impetuous,<lb>
longing to do and dare; tired-looking students, with<lb>
perplexed wrinkles on their foreheads, evidently come<lb>
to see if this man had discovered the great secrets<lb>
they were delving after; and soul-sick people trying<lb>
this new, and perhaps dangerous medicine, when others<lb>
failed to cure. Many earnest, thoughtful men and<lb>
women were there, some on the anxious seat, and some<lb>
already at peace, having found the clew that leads safely<lb>
through the labyrinth of life. Here and there a white<lb>
<pb n="206">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-217">

<figdesc>Page 206.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
head, a placid old face, or one of those fine countenances<lb>
that tell, unconsciously, the beautiful story of<lb>
a victorious soul.</p>
<p>Some read, some talked, some had flowers in their<lb>
hands, and all sat at ease, rich and poor, black and<lb>
white, young and old, waiting for the coming of the<lb>
man who had power to attract and hold so many of his<lb>
kind. Christie was so intent on watching those about<lb>
her that she did not see him enter, and only knew it by<lb>
the silence which began just in front of her, and seemed<lb>
to flow backward like a wave, leaving a sea of expectant<lb>
faces turning to one point. That point was a<lb>
gray head, just visible above the little desk which<lb>
stood in the middle of a great platform. A vase of<lb>
lovely flowers was on the little shelf at one side, a<lb>
great Bible reposed on the other, and a manuscript lay<lb>
on the red slope between.</p>
<p>In a moment Christie forgot every thing else, and<lb>
waited with a curious anxiety to see what manner of<lb>
man this was. Presently he got up with an open book<lb>
in his hand, saying, in a strong, cheerful voice: &ldquo;Let<lb>
us sing,&rdquo; and having read a hymn as if he had composed<lb>
it, he sat down again.</p>
<p>Then everybody did sing; not harmoniously, but<lb>
heartily, led by an organ, which the voices followed at<lb>
their own sweet will. At first, Christie wanted to<lb>
smile, for some shouted and some hummed, some sat<lb>
silent, and others sung sweetly; but before the hymn<lb>
ended she liked it, and thought that the natural praise<lb>
of each individual soul was perhaps more grateful to<lb>
the ear of God than masses by great masters, or psalms<lb>
warbled tunefully by hired opera singers.</p>
<pb n="207">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-218">

<figdesc>Page 207.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Then Mr. Power rose again, and laying his hands<lb>
together, with a peculiarly soft and reverent gesture,<lb>
lifted up his face and prayed. Christie had never heard<lb>
a prayer like that before; so devout, so comprehensive,<lb>
and so brief. A quiet talk with God, asking nothing<lb>
but more love and duty toward Him and our fellow-men;<lb>
thanking Him for many mercies, and confiding all<lb>
things trustfully to the &ldquo;dear father and mother of<lb>
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sermon which followed was as peculiar as the<lb>
prayer, and as effective. &ldquo;One of Power's judgment-day<lb>
sermons,&rdquo; as she heard one man say to another,<lb>
when it was over. Christie certainly felt at first as if<lb>
kingdoms and thrones were going down, and each man<lb>
being sent to his own place. A powerful and popular<lb>
wrong was arrested, tried, and sentenced then and<lb>
there, with a courage and fidelity that made plain<lb>
words eloquent, and stern justice beautiful. He did<lb>
not take David of old for his text, but the strong,<lb>
sinful, splendid Davids of our day, who had not fulfilled<lb>
the promise of their youth, and whose seeming success<lb>
was a delusion and a snare to themselves and others,<lb>
sure to be followed by sorrowful abandonment, defeat,<lb>
and shame. The ashes of the ancient hypocrites and<lb>
Pharisees was left in peace, but those now living were<lb>
heartily denounced; modern money-changers scourged<lb>
out of the temple, and the everlasting truth set up<lb>
therein.</p>
<p>As he spoke, not loudly nor vehemently, but with<lb>
the indescribable effect of inward force and true inspiration,<lb>
a curious stir went through the crowd at times,<lb>
as a great wind sweeps over a corn field, lifting the<lb>
<pb n="208">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-219">

<figdesc>Page 208.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
broad leaves to the light and testing the strength of<lb>
root and stem. People looked at one another with a<lb>
roused expression; eyes kindled, heads nodded involuntary<lb>
approval, and an emphatic, &ldquo;that 's so!&rdquo; dropped<lb>
from the lips of men who saw their own vague instincts<lb>
and silent opinions strongly confirmed and nobly<lb>
uttered. Consciences seemed to have been pricked to<lb>
duty, eyes cleared to see that their golden idols had<lb>
feet of clay, and wavering wills strengthened by the<lb>
salutary courage and integrity of one indomitable man.</p>
<p>Another hymn, and a benediction that seemed like a<lb>
fit grace after meat, and then the crowd poured out;<lb>
not yawning, thinking of best clothes, or longing for<lb>
dinner, but waked up, full of talk, and eager to do<lb>
something to redeem the country and the world.</p>
<p>Christie went rapidly home because she could not<lb>
help it, and burst in upon Mrs. Wilkins with a face full<lb>
of enthusiasm, exclaiming, while she cast off her bonnet<lb>
as if her head had outgrown it since she left:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was splendid! I never heard such a sermon<lb>
before, and I 'll never go to church anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it! ain't it fillin'? don't it give you a kind<lb>
of spirital h'ist, and make things wuth more somehow?&rdquo;<lb>
cried Mrs. Wilkins, gesticulating with the<lb>
pepper-pot in a way which did not improve the steak<lb>
she was cooking, and caused great anguish to the noses<lb>
of her offspring, who were watching the operation.</p>
<p>Quite deaf to the chorus of sneezes which accompanied<lb>
her words, Christie answered, brushing back<lb>
her hair, as if to get a better out-look at creation generally:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed! At first it was rather terrible,<lb>

and yet so true I wouldn't change a word of it. But I<lb>
don't wonder he is misunderstood, belied, and abused.<lb>
He tells the truth so plainly, and lets in the light so<lb>
clearly, that hypocrites and sinners must fear and hate<lb>
him. I think he <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a little hard and unsparing, sometimes,<lb>
though I don't know enough to judge the men<lb>
and measures he condemned. I admire him very much,<lb>
but I should be afraid of him if I ever saw him nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn't; not a grain. You hear him<lb>
preach agin and you 'll find him as gentle as a lamb.<lb>
Strong folks is apt to be ruther ha'sh at times; they<lb>
can't help it no more than this stove can help scorchin'<lb>
the vittles when it gits red hot. Dinner 's ready, so set<lb>
right up and tell me all about it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins,<lb>
slapping the steak on to the platter, and beginning to<lb>
deal out fried potatoes all round with absent-minded<lb>
lavishness.</p>
<p>Christie talked, and the good soul enjoyed that far<lb>
more than her dinner, for she meant to ask Mr. Power<lb>
to help her find the right sort of home for the stranger<lb>
whose unfitness for her present place was every day<lb>
made more apparent to the mind of her hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What took you there first?&rdquo; asked Christie, still<lb>
wondering at Mrs. Wilkins's choice of a minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord, my dear,&rdquo; answered the good woman, in<lb>
a tone of calm conviction. &ldquo;I 'd heard of him, and I<lb>
always have a leanin' towards them that 's reviled; so<lb>
one Sabbath I felt to go, and did. `That 's the gospel<lb>
for me,' says I, `my old church ain't big enough now,<lb>
and I ain't goin' to set and nod there any longer,' and<lb>
I didn't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn't you any doubts about it, any fears of going<lb>
<pb n="210">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-221">

<figdesc>Page 210.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
wrong or being sorry afterwards?&rdquo; asked Christie,<lb>
who believed, as many do, that religion could not be<lb>
attained without much tribulation of some kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some things folks is led; I be frequent, and<lb>
when them leadin's come I don't ask no questions but<lb>
jest foller, and it always turns out right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could be led.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be, my dear, every day of your life only you<lb>
don't see it. When you are doubtful, set still till the<lb>
call comes, then git up and walk whichever way it<lb>
says, and you won't fall. You 've had bread and water<lb>
long enough, now you want meat and wine a spell;<lb>
take it, and when it 's time for milk and honey some<lb>
one will fetch 'em ef you keep your table ready. The<lb>
Lord feeds us right; it 's we that quarrel with our<lb>
vittles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Christie, and began at once to prepare<lb>
her little board for the solid food of which she had had<lb>
a taste that day.</p>
<p>That afternoon Mrs. Wilkins took her turn at churchgoing,<lb>
saw Mr. Power, told Christie's story in her<lb>
best style, and ended by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She 's true grit, I do assure you, sir. Willin' to<lb>
work, but she 's seen the hard side of things and got<lb>
kind of discouraged. Soul and body both wants tinkerin'<lb>
up, and I don't know anybody who can do the<lb>
job better 'n you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I 'll come and see her,&rdquo; answered Mr.<lb>
Power, and Mrs. Wilkins went home well satisfied.</p>
<p>He kept his word, and about the middle of the week<lb>
came walking in upon them as they were at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't let the irons cool,&rdquo; he said, and sitting down<lb>
<pb n="211">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-222">

<figdesc>Page 211.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
in the kitchen began to talk as comfortably as if in the<lb>
best parlor; more so, perhaps, for best parlors are apt<lb>
to have a depressing effect upon the spirits, while<lb>
the mere sight of labor is exhilarating to energetic<lb>
minds.</p>
<p>He greeted Christie kindly, and then addressed himself<lb>
to Mrs. Wilkins on various charitable matters, for<lb>
he was a minister at large, and she one of his almoners.<lb>
Christie could really see him now, for when he preached<lb>
she forgot the man in the sermon, and thought of him<lb>
only as a visible conscience.</p>
<p>A sturdy man of fifty, with a keen, brave face, penetrating<lb>
eyes, and mouth a little grim; but a voice so<lb>
resonant and sweet it reminded one of silver trumpets,<lb>
and stirred and won the hearer with irresistible power.<lb>
Rough grey hair, and all the features rather rugged, as<lb>
if the Great Sculptor had blocked out a grand statue,<lb>
and lef the man's own soul to finish it.</p>
<p>Had Christie known that he came to see <hi rend="italics">her</hi> she<lb>
would have been ill at ease; but Mrs. Wilkins had kept<lb>
her own counsel, so when Mr. Power turned to Christie,<lb>
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend here tells me you want something to do.<lb>
Would you like to help a Quaker lady with her housework,<lb>
just out of town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered readily: &ldquo;Yes, sir, any thing that<lb>
is honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as a servant, exactly, but companion and<lb>
helper. Mrs. Sterling is a dear old lady, and the place<lb>
a pleasant little nest. It is good to be there, and I<lb>
think you'll say so if you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds pleasant. When shall I go?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="212">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-223">

<figdesc>Page 212.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Mr. Power smiled at her alacrity, but the longing<lb>
look in her eyes explained it, for he saw at a glance<lb>
that her place was not here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write at once and let you know how matters<lb>
are settled. Then you shall try it, and if it is not what<lb>
you want, we will find you something else. There 's<lb>
plenty to do, and nothing pleasanter than to put the<lb>
right pair of hands to the right task. Good-by; come<lb>
and see me if the spirit moves, and don't let go of Mrs.<lb>
Wilkins till you lay hold of a better friend, if you can<lb>
find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he shook hands cordially, and went walking<lb>
out again into the wild March weather as if he<lb>
liked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you afraid of him?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot all about it: he looked so kind and friendly.<lb>
But I shouldn't like to have those piercing eyes of his<lb>
fixed on me long if I had any secret on my conscience,&rdquo;<lb>
answered Christie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain't nothin' to fear. He liked your way of<lb>
speakin' fust rate, I see that, and you 'll be all right<lb>
now he 's took hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Mrs. Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by sight, but she 's a sweet appearin' woman,<lb>
and I wouldn't ask nothin' better 'n to see more of<lb>
her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, warmly, fearing Christie's heart<lb>
might misgive her.</p>
<p>But it did not, and when a note came saying Mrs.<lb>
Sterling would be ready for her the next week, she<lb>
seemed quite content with every thing, for though the<lb>
wages were not high she felt that country air and quiet<lb>
were worth more to her just then than money, and<lb>
that Wilkinses were better taken hom&oelig;opathically.</p>
<pb n="213">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-224">

<figdesc>Page 213.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The spirit did move her to go and see Mr. Power, but<lb>
she could not make up her mind to pass that invisible<lb>
barrier which stands between so many who could give<lb>
one another genuine help if they only dared to ask it.<lb>
But when Sunday came she went to church, eager<lb>
for more, and thankful that she knew where to go<lb>
for it.</p>
<p>This was a very different sermon from the other, and<lb>
Christie felt as if he preached it for her alone. &ldquo;Keep<lb>
innocency and take heed to the thing that is right, for<lb>
this will bring a man peace at the last,&rdquo; might have<lb>
been the text, and Mr. Power treated it as if he had<lb>
known all the trials and temptations that made it hard<lb>
to live up to.</p>
<p>Justice and righteous wrath possessed him before,<lb>
now mercy and tenderest sympathy for those who<lb>
faltered in well-doing, and the stern judge seemed<lb>
changed to a pitiful father. But better than the pity<lb>
was the wise counsel, the cheering words, and the devout<lb>
surrender of the soul to its best instincts; its<lb>
close communion with its Maker, unchilled by fear,<lb>
untrammelled by the narrowness of sect or superstition,<lb>
but full and free and natural as the breath of<lb>
life.</p>
<p>As she listened Christie felt as if she was climbing up<lb>
from a solitary valley, through mist and shadow toward<lb>
a mountain top, where, though the way might be rough<lb>
and strong winds blow, she would get a wider outlook<lb>
over the broad earth, and be nearer the serene blue<lb>
sky. For the first time in her life religion seemed a<lb>
visible and vital thing; a power that she could grasp<lb>
and feel, take into her life and make her daily bread.<lb>
<pb n="214">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-225">

<figdesc>Page 214.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Not a vague, vast idea floating before her, now beautiful,<lb>
now terrible, always undefined and far away.</p>
<p>She was strangely and powerfully moved that day, for<lb>
the ploughing had begun; and when the rest stood up<lb>
for the last hymn, Christie could only bow her head<lb>
and let the uncontrollable tears flow down like summer<lb>
rain, while her heart sang with new aspiration:</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;Nearer, my God, to thee,</l>
<l>E'en though a cross it be</l>
<l rend="indent">That raiseth me,</l>
<l>Still all my song shall be,</l>
<l>Nearer, my God, to thee.</l>
<l rend="indent">Nearer to thee!&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Sitting with her hand before her eyes, she never<lb>
stirred till the sound of many feet told her that service<lb>
was done. Then she wiped her eyes, dropped her veil,<lb>
and was about to rise when she saw a little bunch of<lb>
flowers between the leaves of the hymn book lying<lb>
open in her lap. Only a knot of violets set in their<lb>
own broad leaves, but blue as friendly eyes looking<lb>
into hers, and sweet as kind words whispered in her<lb>
ear. She looked about her hoping to detect and thank<lb>
the giver; but all faces were turned the other way, and<lb>
all feet departing rapidly.</p>
<p>Christie followed with a very grateful thought in her<lb>
heart for this little kindness from some unknown friend;<lb>
and, anxious to recover herself entirely before she faced<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins, she took a turn in the park.</p>
<p>The snow was gone, high winds had dried the walk,<lb>
and a clear sky overhead made one forget sodden turf<lb>
and chilly air. March was going out like a lamb, and<lb>
Christie enjoyed an occasional vernal whiff from far-off<lb>
<pb n="215">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-226">

<figdesc>Page 215.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fields and wakening woods, as she walked down the<lb>
broad mall watching the buds on the boughs, and listening<lb>
to the twitter of the sparrows, evidently discussing<lb>
the passers-by as they sat at the doors of their little<lb>
mansions.</p>
<p>Presently she turned to walk back again and saw<lb>
Mr. Power coming toward her. She was glad, for all<lb>
her fear had vanished now, and she wanted to thank<lb>
him for the sermon that had moved her so deeply. He<lb>
shook hands in his cordial way, and, turning, walked<lb>
with her, beginning at once to talk of her affairs as if<lb>
interested in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready for the new experiment?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite ready, sir; very glad to go, and very much<lb>
obliged to you for your kindness in providing for<lb>
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what we were put into the world for, to help<lb>
one another. You can pass on the kindness by serving<lb>
my good friends who, in return, will do their best for<lb>
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's so pleasant! I always knew there were<lb>
plenty of good, friendly people in the world, only I did<lb>
not seem to find them often, or be able to keep them<lb>
long when I did. Is Mr. Sterling an agreeable old<lb>
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very agreeable, but not old. David is about<lb>
thirty-one or two, I think. He is the son of my<lb>
friend, the husband died some years ago. I thought I<lb>
mentioned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said in your note that Mr. Sterling was a florist,<lb>
and might like me to help in the green-house, if I was<lb>
willing. It must be lovely work, and I <hi rend="italics">should</hi> like it<lb>
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="216">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-227">

<figdesc>Page 216.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, David devotes himself to his flowers, and leads<lb>
a very quiet life. You may think him rather grave and<lb>
blunt at first, but you 'll soon find him out and get on<lb>
comfortably, for he is a truly excellent fellow, and my<lb>
right-hand man in good works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious little change had passed over Christie's face<lb>
during these last questions and answers, unconscious,<lb>
but quite observable to keen eyes like Mr. Power's.<lb>
Surprise and interest appeared first, then a shadow of<lb>
reserve as if the young woman dropped a thin veil between<lb>
herself and the young man, and at the last words<lb>
a half smile and a slight raising of the brows seemed to<lb>
express the queer mixture of pity and indifference with<lb>
which we are all apt to regard &ldquo;excellent fellows&rdquo; and<lb>
&ldquo;amiable girls.&rdquo; Mr. Power understood the look, and<lb>
went on more confidentially than he had at first intended,<lb>
for he did not want Christie to go off with a<lb>
prejudice in her mind which might do both David and<lb>
herself injustice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People sometimes misjudge him, for he is rather<lb>
old-fashioned in manner and plain in speech, and may<lb>
seem unsocial, because he does not seek society. But<lb>
those who know the cause of this forgive any little<lb>
short-comings for the sake of the genuine goodness of<lb>
the man. David had a great trouble some years ago<lb>
and suffered much. He is learning to bear it bravely,<lb>
and is the better for it, though the memory of it is still<lb>
bitter, and the cross hard to bear even with pride to<lb>
help him hide it, and principle to keep him from<lb>
despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Power glanced at Christie as he paused, and was<lb>
satisfied with the effect of his words, for interest, pity,<lb>
<pb n="217">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-228">

<figdesc>Page 217.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="10">
and respect shone in her face, and proved that he had<lb>
touched the right string. She seemed to feel that this<lb>
little confidence was given for a purpose, and showed<lb>
that she accepted it as a sort of gage for her own fidelity<lb>
to her new employers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, I shall remember,&rdquo; she said, with<lb>
her frank eyes lifted gravely to his own. &ldquo;I like to<lb>
work for people whom I can respect,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and<lb>
will bear with any peculiarities of Mr. Sterling's without<lb>
a thought of complaint. When a man has suffered<lb>
through one woman, all women should be kind and<lb>
patient with him, and try to atone for the wrong which<lb>
lessens his respect and faith in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are right; and in this case all women<lb>
<hi rend="italics">should</hi> be kind, for David pities and protects womankind<lb>
as the only retaliation for the life-long grief one<lb>
woman brought upon him. That's not a common revenge,<lb>
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's beautiful!&rdquo; cried Christie, and instantly David<lb>
was a hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time it was an even chance whether that<lb>
trouble sent David to `the devil,' as he expressed it, or<lb>
made a man of him. That little saint of a mother kept<lb>
him safe till the first desperation was over, and now he<lb>
lives for her, as he ought. Not so romantic an ending<lb>
as a pistol or Byronic scorn for the world in general<lb>
and women in particular, but dutiful and brave, since<lb>
it often takes more courage to live than to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Christie, heartily, though her eyes<lb>
fell, remembering how she had failed with far less<lb>
cause for despair than David.</p>

</p>
<p>They were at the gate now, and Mr. Power left her,<lb>
saying, with a vigorous hand-shake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best wishes for a happy summer. I shall come<lb>
sometimes to see how you prosper; and remember, if<lb>
you tire of it and want to change, let me know, for I<lb>
take great satisfaction in putting the right people in the<lb>
right places. Good-by, and God be with you.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>IT was an April day when Christie went to her new<lb>
home. Warm rains had melted the last trace of<lb>
snow, and every bank was full of pricking grass-blades,<lb>
brave little pioneers and heralds of the Spring. The<lb>
budding elm boughs swung in the wind; blue-jays<lb>
screamed among the apple-trees; and robins chirped<lb>
shrilly, as if rejoicing over winter hardships safely<lb>
passed. Vernal freshness was in the air despite its<lb>
chill, and lovely hints of summer time were everywhere.<lb>
</p>
<pb n="220">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-231">

<figdesc>Page 220.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>These welcome sights and sounds met Christie, as<lb>
she walked down the lane, and, coming to a gate,<lb>
paused there to look about her. An old-fashioned<lb>
cottage stood in the midst of a garden just awakening<lb>
from its winter sleep. One elm hung protectingly over<lb>
the low roof, sunshine lay warmly on it, and at every<lb>
window flowers' bright faces smiled at the passer-by<lb>
invitingly.</p>
<p>On one side glittered a long green-house, and on the<lb>
other stood a barn, with a sleek cow ruminating in the<lb>
yard, and an inquiring horse poking his head out of his<lb>
stall to view the world. Many comfortable gray hens<lb>
were clucking and scratching about the hay-strewn<lb>
floor, and a flock of doves sat cooing on the roof.</p>
<p>A quiet, friendly place it looked; for nothing marred<lb>
its peace, and the hopeful, healthful spirit of the season<lb>
seemed to haunt the spot. Snow-drops and crocuses<lb>
were up in one secluded nook; a plump maltese cat sat<lb>
purring in the porch; and a dignified old dog came<lb>
marching down the walk to escort the stranger in.<lb>
With a brightening face Christie went up the path,<lb>
and tapped at the quaint knocker, hoping that the face<lb>
she was about to see would be in keeping with the<lb>
pleasant place.</p>
<p>She was not disappointed, for the dearest of little<lb>
Quaker ladies opened to her, with such an air of peace<lb>
and good-will that the veriest ruffian, coming to molest<lb>
or make afraid, would have found it impossible to mar<lb>
the tranquillity of that benign old face, or disturb one<lb>
fold of the soft muslin crossed upon her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come from Mr. Power, and I have a note for<lb>
Mrs. Sterling,&rdquo; began Christie in her gentlest tone, as<lb>
<pb n="221">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-232">

<figdesc>Page 221.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
her last fear vanished at sight of that mild maternal<lb>
figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am she; come in, friend; I am glad to see thee,&rdquo;<lb>
said the old lady, smiling placidly, as she led the way<lb>
into a room whose principal furniture seemed to be<lb>
books, flowers, and sunshine.</p>
<p>The look, the tone, the gentle &ldquo;thee,&rdquo; went straight<lb>
to Christie's heart; and, while Mrs. Sterling put on her<lb>
spectacles and slowly read the note, she stroked the cat<lb>
and said to herself: &ldquo;Surely, I have fallen among a set<lb>
of angels. I thought Mrs. Wilkins a sort of saint, Mr.<lb>
Power was an improvement even upon that good soul,<lb>
and if I am not mistaken this sweet little lady is the<lb>
best and dearest of all. I do hope she will like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite right, my dear, and I am most glad to<lb>
see thee; for we need help at this season of the year,<lb>
and have had none for several weeks. Step up to the<lb>
room at the head of the stairs, and lay off thy things.<lb>
Then, if thee is not tired, I will give thee a little job<lb>
with me in the kitchen,&rdquo; said the old lady with a kindly<lb>
directness which left no room for awkwardness on the<lb>
new-comer's part.</p>
<p>Up went Christie, and after a hasty look round a<lb>
room as plain and white and still as a nun's cell, she<lb>
whisked on a working-apron and ran down again,<lb>
feeling, as she fancied the children did in the fairy tale,<lb>
when they first arrived at the house of the little old<lb>
woman who lived in the wood.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins's kitchen was as neat as a room could<lb>
be, wherein six children came and went, but this<lb>
kitchen was tidy with the immaculate order of which<lb>
Shakers and Quakers alone seem to possess the secret, &mdash;<lb>
<pb n="222">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-233">

<figdesc>Page 222.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
a fragrant, shining cleanliness, that made even black<lb>
kettles ornamental and dish-pans objects of interest.<lb>
Nothing burned or boiled over, though the stove was<lb>
full of dinner-pots and skillets. There was no litter or<lb>
hurry, though the baking of cake and pies was going<lb>
on, and when Mrs. Sterling put a pan of apples, and a<lb>
knife into her new assistant's hands, saying in a tone<lb>
that made the request a favor, &ldquo;Will thee kindly pare<lb>
these for me?&rdquo; Christie wondered what would happen<lb>
if she dropped a seed upon the floor, or did not cut the<lb>
apples into four exact quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never shall suit this dear prim soul,&rdquo; she thought,<lb>
as her eye went from Puss, sedately perched on one<lb>
small mat, to the dog dozing upon another, and neither<lb>
offering to stir from their own dominions.</p>
<p>This dainty nicety amused her at first, but she liked<lb>
it, and very soon her thoughts went back to the old<lb>
times when she worked with Aunt Betsey, and learned<lb>
the good old-fashioned arts which now were to prove<lb>
her fitness for this pleasant place.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sterling saw the shadow that crept into Christie's<lb>
face, and led the chat to cheerful things, not saying<lb>
much herself, but beguiling the other to talk, and listening<lb>
with an interest that made it easy to go on.</p>
<p>Mr. Power and the Wilkinses made them friends<lb>
very soon; and in an hour or two Christie was moving<lb>
about the kitchen as if she had already taken possession<lb>
of her new kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee likes housework I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sterling,<lb>
as she watched her hang up a towel to dry, and rinse<lb>
her dish-cloth when the cleaning up was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! if I need not do it with a shiftless Irish girl<lb>
<pb n="223">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-234">

<figdesc>Page 223.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to drive me distracted by pretending to help. I have<lb>
lived out, and did not find it hard while I had my good<lb>
Hepsey. I was second girl, and can set a table in style.<lb>
Shall I try now?&rdquo; she asked, as the old lady went into<lb>
a little dining-room with fresh napkins in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we have no style here. I will show thee<lb>
once, and hereafter it will be thy work, as thy feet are<lb>
younger than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A nice old-fashioned table was soon spread, and<lb>
Christie kept smiling at the contrast between this and<lb>
Mrs. Stuart's. Chubby little pitchers appeared, delicate<lb>
old glass, queer china, and tiny tea-spoons; linen as<lb>
smooth as satin, and a quaint tankard that might have<lb>
come over in the &ldquo;May-flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, will thee take that pitcher of water to David's<lb>
room? It is at the top of the house, and may need<lb>
a little dusting. I have not been able to attend to<lb>
it as I would like since I have been alone,&rdquo; said Mrs.<lb>
Sterling.</p>
<p>Rooms usually betray something of the character and<lb>
tastes of their occupants, and Christie paused a moment<lb>
as she entered David's, to look about her with feminine<lb>
interest.</p>
<p>It was the attic, and extended the whole length of<lb>
the house. One end was curtained off as a bedroom,<lb>
and she smiled at its austere simplicity.</p>
<p>A gable in the middle made a sunny recess, where<lb>
were stored bags and boxes of seed, bunches of herbs,<lb>
and shelves full of those tiny pots in which baby plants<lb>
are born and nursed till they can grow alone.</p>
<p>The west end was evidently the study, and here<lb>
Christie took a good look as she dusted tidily. The<lb>
<pb n="224">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-235">

<figdesc>Page 224.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
furniture was nothing, only an old sofa, with the horsehair<lb>
sticking out in tufts here and there; an antique<lb>
secretary; and a table covered with books. As she<lb>
whisked the duster down the front of the ancient piece<lb>
of furniture, one of the doors in the upper half swung<lb>
open, and Christie saw three objects that irresistibly<lb>
riveted her eyes for a moment. A broken fan, a bundle<lb>
of letters tied up with a black ribbon, and a little workbasket<lb>
in which lay a fanciful needle-book with &ldquo;Letty&rdquo;<lb>
embroidered on it in faded silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor David, that is his little shrine, and I have no<lb>
right to see it,&rdquo; thought Christie, shutting the door with<lb>
self-reproachful haste.</p>
<p>At the table she paused again, for books always attracted<lb>
her, and here she saw a goodly array whose names<lb>
were like the faces of old friends, because she remembered<lb>
them in her father's library.</p>
<p>Faust was full of ferns, Shakspeare, of rough sketches<lb>
of the men and women whom he has made immortal.<lb>
Saintly Herbert lay side by side with Saint<lb>
Augustine's confessions. Milton and Montaigne stood<lb>
socially together, and Andersen's lovely &ldquo;M&auml;rchen&rdquo; fluttered<lb>
its pictured leaves in the middle of an open Plato;<lb>
while several books in unknown tongues were half-hidden<lb>
by volumes of Browning, Keats, and Coleridge.</p>
<p>In the middle of this fine society, slender and transparent<lb>
as the spirit of a shape, stood a little vase holding<lb>
one half-opened rose, fresh and fragrant as if just<lb>
gathered.</p>
<p>Christie smiled as she saw it, and wondered if the<lb>
dear, dead, or false woman had been fond of roses.</p>
<p>Then her eye went to the mantel-piece, just above<lb>
<pb n="225">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-236">

<figdesc>Page 225.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="10* O">
the table, and she laughed; for, on it stood three busts,<lb>
idols evidently, but very shabby ones; for G&ouml;the's nose<lb>
was broken, Schiller's head cracked visibly, and the<lb>
dust of ages seemed to have settled upon Linn&aelig;us in<lb>
the middle. On the wall above them hung a curious<lb>
old picture of a monk kneeling in a devout ecstasy,<lb>
while the face of an angel is dimly seen through the<lb>
radiance that floods the cell with divine light. Portraits<lb>
of Mr. Power and Martin Luther stared thoughtfully<lb>
at one another from either side, as if making up<lb>
their minds to shake hands in spite of time and space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melancholy, learned, and sentimental,&rdquo; said Christie<lb>
to herself, as she settled David's character after these<lb>
discoveries.</p>
<p>The sound of a bell made her hasten down, more<lb>
curious than ever to see if this belief was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps thee had better step out and call my son.<lb>
Sometimes he does not hear the bell when he is busy.<lb>
Thee will find my garden-hood and shawl behind the<lb>
door,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sterling, presently; for punctuality<lb>
was a great virtue in the old lady's eyes.</p>
<p>Christie demurely tied on the little pumpkin-hood,<lb>
wrapped the gray shawl about her, and set out to find<lb>
her &ldquo;master,&rdquo; as she had a fancy to call this unknown<lb>
David.</p>
<p>From the hints dropped by Mr. Power, and her late<lb>
discoveries, she had made a hero for herself; a sort of<lb>
melancholy Jaques; sad and pale and stern; retired<lb>
from the world to nurse his wounds in solitude. She<lb>
rather liked this picture; for romance dies hard in a<lb>
woman, and, spite of her experiences, Christie still indulged<lb>
in dreams and fancies. &ldquo;It will be so<lb>
<pb n="226">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-237">

<figdesc>Page 226.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
interesting to see how he bears his secret sorrow. I am fond<lb>
of woe; but I do hope he won't be too lackadaisical, for<lb>
I never could abide that sort of blighted being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking thus, she peeped here and there, but saw no<lb>
one in yard or barn, except a workman scraping the<lb>
mould off his boots near the conservatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This David is among the flowers, I fancy; I will<lb>
just ask, and not bolt in, as he does not know me.<lb>
&ldquo;Where is Mr. Sterling?&rdquo; added Christie aloud, as she<lb>
approached.</p>
<p>The man looked up, and a smile came into his eyes,<lb>
as he glanced from the old hood to the young face inside.<lb>
Then he took off his hat, and held out his hand,<lb>
saying with just his mother's simple directness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am David; and this is Christie Devon, I know.<lb>
How do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; dinner 's ready,&rdquo; was all she could reply, for<lb>
the discovery that this was the &ldquo;master,&rdquo; nearly took<lb>
her breath away. Not the faintest trace of the melancholy<lb>
Jaques about him; nothing interesting, romantic,<lb>
pensive, or even stern. Only a broad-shouldered, brownbearded<lb>
man, with an old hat and coat, trousers tucked<lb>
into his boots, fresh mould on the hand he had given<lb>
her to shake, and the cheeriest voice she had ever<lb>
heard.</p>
<p>What a blow it was to be sure! Christie actually<lb>
felt vexed with him for disappointing her so, and could<lb>
not recover herself, but stood red and awkward, till,<lb>
with a last scrape of his boots, David said with placid<lb>
brevity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shall we go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie walked rapidly into the house, and by the<lb>
<pb n="227">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-238">

<figdesc>Page 227.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
time she got there the absurdity of her fancy struck<lb>
her, and she stifled a laugh in the depths of the little<lb>
pumpkin-hood, as she hung it up. Then, assuming her<lb>
gravest air, she went to give the finishing touches to<lb>
dinner.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later she received another surprise; for<lb>
David appeared washed, brushed, and in a suit of gray,&mdash;<lb>
a personable gentleman, quite unlike the workman<lb>
in the yard.</p>
<p>Christie gave one look, met a pair of keen yet kind<lb>
eyes with a suppressed laugh in them, and dropped her<lb>
own, to be no more lifted up till dinner was done.</p>
<p>It was a very quiet meal, for no one said much; and<lb>
it was evidently the custom of the house to eat silently,<lb>
only now and then saying a few friendly words, to show<lb>
that the hearts were social if the tongues were not.</p>
<p>On the present occasion this suited Christie; and she<lb>
ate her dinner without making any more discoveries,<lb>
except that the earth-stained hands were very clean<lb>
now, and skilfully supplied her wants before she could<lb>
make them known.</p>
<p>As they rose from table, Mrs. Sterling said: &ldquo;Davy,<lb>
does thee want any help this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very gland of some in about an hour if<lb>
thee can spare it, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you care for flowers?&rdquo; asked David, turning to<lb>
Christie, &ldquo;because if you do not, this will be a very<lb>
trying place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to love them dearly; but I have not had any<lb>
for so long I hardly remember how they look,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Christie with a sigh, as she recalled Rachel's<lb>
<pb n="228">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-239">

<figdesc>Page 228.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
roses, dead long ago. &ldquo;Shy, sick, and sad; poor soul,<lb>
we must lend a hand and cheer her up a bit&rdquo; thought<lb>
David, as he watched her eyes turn toward the green<lb>
things in the windows with a bright, soft look, he liked<lb>
to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the conservatory in an hour, and I 'll show<lb>
you the best part of a `German,&rdquo;' he said, with a nod<lb>
and a smile, as he went away, beginning to whistle like<lb>
a boy when the door was shut behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he mean?&rdquo; thought Christie, as she<lb>
helped clear the table, and put every thing in Pimlico<lb>
order.</p>
<p>She was curious to know, and when Mrs. Sterling<lb>
said: &ldquo;Now, my dear, I am going to take my nap, and<lb>
thee can help David if thee likes,&rdquo; she was quite ready<lb>
to try the new work.</p>
<p>She would have been more than woman if she had<lb>
not first slipped upstairs to smooth her hair, put on a<lb>
fresh collar, and a black silk apron with certain effective<lb>
frills and pockets, while a scarlet rigolette replaced the<lb>
hood, and lent a little color to her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a poor ghost of what I was,&rdquo; she thought;<lb>
&ldquo;but that 's no matter: few can be pretty, any one can<lb>
be neat, and that is more than ever necessary here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went away to the conservatory, feeling<lb>
rather oppressed with the pity and sympathy, for which<lb>
there was no call, and fervently wishing that David<lb>
would not be so comfortable, for he ate a hearty dinner,<lb>
laughed four times, and whistled as no heart-broken<lb>
man would dream of doing.</p>
<p>No one was visible as she went in, and walking slowly<lb>
down the green aisle, she gave herself up to the<lb>
<pb n="229">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-240">

<figdesc>Page 229.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enjoyment of the lovely place. The damp, sweet air<lb>
made summer there, and a group of slender, oriental<lb>
trees whispered in the breath of wind that blew in from<lb>
an open sash. Strange vines and flowers hung overhead;<lb>
banks of azaleas, ruddy, white, and purple, bloomed<lb>
in one place; roses of every hue turned their lovely<lb>
faces to the sun; ranks of delicate ferns, and heaths<lb>
with their waxen bells, were close by; glowing geraniums<lb>
and stately lilies side by side; savage-looking scarlet<lb>
flowers with purple hearts, or orange spikes rising from<lb>
leaves mottled with strange colors; dusky passion-flowers,<lb>
and gay nasturtiums climbing to the roof. All<lb>
manner of beautiful and curious plants were there; and<lb>
Christie walked among them, as happy as a child who<lb>
finds its playmates again.</p>
<p>Coming to a bed of pansies she sat down on a rustic<lb>
chair, and, leaning forward, feasted her eyes on these<lb>
her favorites. Her face grew young as she looked, her<lb>
hands touched them with a lingering tenderness as if<lb>
to her they were half human, and her own eyes were<lb>
so busy enjoying the gold and purple spread before<lb>
her, that she did not see another pair peering at her<lb>
over an unneighborly old cactus, all prickles, and queer<lb>
knobs. Presently a voice said at her elbow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look as if you saw something beside pansies<lb>
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David spoke so quietly that it did not startle her, and<lb>
she answered before she had time to feel ashamed of<lb>
her fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; for, ever since I was a child, I always see a<lb>
little face when I look at this flower. Sometimes it is<lb>
a sad one, sometimes it 's merry, often roguish, but<lb>
<pb n="230">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-241">

<figdesc>Page 230.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
always a dear little face; and when I see so many together,<lb>
it 's like a flock of children, all nodding and smiling<lb>
at me at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; and David nodded, and smiled himself,<lb>
as he handed her two or three of the finest, as if it was<lb>
as natural a thing as to put a sprig of mignonette in<lb>
his own button-hole.</p>
<p>Christie thanked him, and then jumped up, remembering<lb>
that she came there to work, not to dream. He<lb>
seemed to understand, and went into a little room near<lb>
by, saying, as he pointed to a heap of gay flowers on<lb>
the table:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are to be made into little bouquets for a<lb>
`German' to-night. It is pretty work, and better fitted<lb>
for a woman's fingers than a man's. This is all you<lb>
have to do, and you can use your taste as to colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he spoke David laid a read and white carnation<lb>
on a bit of smilax, tied them together, twisted a<lb>
morsel of silver foil about the stems, and laid it before<lb>
Christie as a sample.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can do that, and shall like it very much,&rdquo; she<lb>
said, burying her nose in the mass of sweetness before<lb>
her, and feeling as if her new situation grew pleasanter<lb>
every minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the apron my mother uses, that bit of silk<lb>
will soon be spoilt, for the flowers are wet,&rdquo; and David<lb>
gravely offered her a large checked pinafore.</p>
<p>Christie could not help laughing as she put it on:<lb>
all this was so different from the imaginary picture she<lb>
had made. She was disappointed, and yet she began<lb>
to feel as if the simple truth was better than the sentimental<lb>
fiction; and glanced up at David involuntarily<lb>
<pb n="231">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-242">

<figdesc>Page 231.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to see if there were any traces of interesting woe about<lb>
him.</p>
<p>But he was looking at her with the steady, straightforward<lb>
look which she liked so much, yet could not<lb>
meet just yet; and all she saw was that he was smiling<lb>
also with an indulgent expression as if she was a little<lb>
girl whom he was trying to amuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a few, and I 'll be back directly when I have<lb>
attended to another order,&rdquo; and he went away thinking<lb>
Christie's face was very like the pansies they had been<lb>
talking about, &mdash; one of the sombre ones with a bright<lb>
touch of gold deep down in the heart, for thin and pale<lb>
as the face was, it lighted up at a kind word, and all<lb>
the sadness vanished out of the anxious eyes when the<lb>
frank laugh came.</p>
<p>Christie fell to work with a woman's interest in such<lb>
a pleasant task, and soon tied and twisted skilfully,<lb>
exercising all her taste in contrasts, and the pretty<lb>
little conceits flower-lovers can produce. She was so<lb>
interested that presently she began to hum half unconsciously,<lb>
as she was apt to do when happily employed:<lb>
</p>
<q><lg type="verse">

<l rend="indent">Fresh and fair,</l>
<l rend="indent">Yet you are</l>

</lg></q>
<p>There she stopped, for David's step drew near, and<lb>
she remembered where she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last verse is the best in that little poem. Have<lb>

you forgotten it?&rdquo; he said, pleased and surprised to<lb>
find the new-comer singing Herrick's lines &ldquo;To Violets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost; my father used to say that when we went<lb>
looking for early violets, and these lovely ones reminded<lb>
me of it,&rdquo; explained Christie, rather abashed.</p>
<pb n="233">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-244">

<figdesc>Page 233.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>As if to put her at ease David added, as he laid another<lb>
handful of double-violets on the table:</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;`Y' are the maiden posies,</l>
<l rend="indent">And so graced,</l>
<l rend="indent">To be placed</l>
<l>'Fore damask roses.</l>
<l>Yet, though thus respected,</l>
<l rend="indent">By and by</l>
<l rend="indent">Ye do lie,</l>
<l>Poor girls, neglected.'</l>
</lg></q>
<p>&ldquo;I always think of them as pretty, modest maids<lb>
after that, and can't bear to throw them away, even<lb>
when faded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie hoped he did not think her sentimental, and<lb>
changed the conversation by pointing to her work, and<lb>
saying, in a business-like way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will these do? I have varied the posies as much<lb>
as possible, so that they may suit all sorts of tastes and<lb>
whims. I never went to a `German' myself; but I have<lb>
looked on, and remember hearing the young people say<lb>
the little bouquets didn't mean any thing, so I tried to<lb>
make these expressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think you had succeeded excellently,<lb>
and it is a very pretty fancy. Tell me what some of<lb>
them mean: will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know better than I, being a florist,&rdquo;<lb>
said Christie, glad to see he approved of her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can grow the flowers, but not read them,&rdquo; and<lb>
David looked rather depressed by his own ignorance<lb>
of those delicate matters.</p>
<p>Still with the business-like air, Christie held up one<lb>
<pb n="234">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-245">

<figdesc>Page 234.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
after another of the little knots, saying soberly, though<lb>
her eyes smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This white one might be given to a newly engaged<lb>
girl, as suggestive of the coming bridal. That half-blown<lb>
bud would say a great deal from a lover to his<lb>
idol; and this heliotrope be most encouraging to a<lb>
timid swain. Here is a rosy daisy for some merry little<lb>
damsel; there is a scarlet posy for a soldier; this delicate<lb>
azalea and fern for some lovely creature just out;<lb>
and there is a bunch of sober pansies for a spinster, if<lb>
spinsters go to `Germans.' Heath, scentless but pretty,<lb>
would do for many; these Parma violets for one with<lb>
a sorrow; and this curious purple flower with arrowshaped<lb>
stamens would just suit a handsome, sharp-tongued<lb>
woman, if any partner dared give it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed, as his eye went from the flowers to<lb>
Christie's face, and when she laid down the last breastknot,<lb>
looking as if she would like the chance of presenting<lb>
it to some one she knew, he seemed much amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the beaux and belles at this party have the wit<lb>
to read your posies, my fortune will be made, and you<lb>
will have your hands full supplying compliments, declarations,<lb>
rebukes, and criticisms for the fashionable<lb>
butterflies. I wish I could put consolation, hope, and<lb>
submission into <hi rend="italics">my</hi> work as easily, but I am afraid I<lb>
can't,&rdquo; he added a moment afterward with a changed<lb>
face, as he began to lay the loveliest white flowers into<lb>
a box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are not for a wedding, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a dead baby; and I can't seem to find any white<lb>
and sweet enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the people?&rdquo; asked Christie, with the<lb>
sympathetic tone in her voice.</p>
<pb n="235">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-246">

<figdesc>Page 235.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw or heard of them till to-day. Isn't it<lb>
enough to know that `baby 's dead,' as the poor man<lb>
said, to make one feel for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is; only you seemed so interested in<lb>
arranging the flowers, I naturally thought it was for<lb>
some friend,&rdquo; Christie answered hastily, for David<lb>
looked half indignant at her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want them to look lovely and comforting when<lb>
the mother opens the box, and I don't seem to have<lb>
the right flowers. Will you give it a touch? women<lb>
have a tender way of doing such things that we can<lb>
never learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think I can improve it, unless I add another<lb>
sort of flower that seems appropriate: may I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any thing you can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie waited for no more, but ran out of the green-house<lb>
to David's great surprise, and presently came<lb>
hurrying back with a handful of snow-drops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are just what I wanted, but I didn't know<lb>
the little dears were up yet! You shall put them in,<lb>
and I know they will suggest what you hope to these<lb>
poor people,&rdquo; he said approvingly, as he placed the box<lb>
before her, and stood by watching her adjust the little<lb>
sheaf of pale flowers tied up with a blade of grass.<lb>
She added a frail fern or two, and did give just the<lb>
graceful touch here and there which would speak to<lb>
the mother's sore heart of the tender thought some one<lb>
had taken for her dead darling.</p>
<p>The box was sent away, and Christie went on with<lb>
her work, but that little task performed together seemed<lb>
to have made them friends; and, while David tied up<lb>
several grand bouquets at the same table, they talked<lb>
<pb n="236">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-247">

<figdesc>Page 236.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
as if the strangeness was fast melting away from their<lb>
short acquaintance.</p>
<p>Christie's own manners were so simple that simplicity<lb>
in others always put her at her ease: kindness soon<lb>
banished her reserve, and the desire to show that she<lb>
was grateful for it helped her to please. David's bluntness<lb>
was of such a gentle sort that she soon got used<lb>
to it, and found it a pleasant contrast to the polite<lb>
insincerity so common. He was as frank and friendly<lb>
as a boy, yet had a certain paternal way with him<lb>
which rather annoyed her at first, and made her feel as<lb>
if he thought her a mere girl, while she was very sure<lb>
he could not be but a year or two older than herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd rather he 'd be masterful, and order me about,&rdquo;<lb>
she thought, still rather regretting the &ldquo;blighted being&rdquo;<lb>
she had not found.</p>
<p>In spite of this she spent a pleasant afternoon, sitting<lb>
in that sunny place, handling flowers, asking questions<lb>
about them, and getting the sort of answers she liked;<lb>
not dry botanical names and facts, but all the delicate<lb>
traits, curious habits, and poetical romances of the<lb>
sweet things, as if the speaker knew and loved them as<lb>
friends, not merely valued them as merchandise.</p>
<p>They had just finished when the great dog came<lb>
bouncing in with a basket in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother wants eggs: will you come to the barn and<lb>
get them? Hay is wholesome, and you can feed the<lb>
doves if you like,&rdquo; said David, leading the way with<lb>
Bran rioting about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don't he offer to put up a swing for me, or<lb>
get me a doll? It 's the pinafore that deceives him.<lb>
Never mind: I rather like it after all,&rdquo; thought Christie;<lb>
<pb n="237">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-248">

<figdesc>Page 237.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
but she left the apron behind her, and followed with<lb>
the most dignified air.</p>
<p>It did not last long, however, for the sights and<lb>
sounds that greeted her, carried her back to the days<lb>
of egg-hunting in Uncle Enos's big barn; and, before<lb>
she knew it, she was rustling through the hay mows,<lb>
talking to the cow and receiving the attentions of Bran<lb>
with a satisfaction it was impossible to conceal.</p>
<p>The hens gathered about her feet cocking their<lb>
expectant eyes at her; the doves came circling round<lb>
her head; the cow stared placidly, and the inquisitive<lb>
horse responded affably when she offered him a handful<lb>
of hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How tame they all are! I like animals, they are<lb>
so contented and intelligent,&rdquo; she said, as a plump dove<lb>
lit on her shoulder with an impatient coo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Kitty's pet, she always fed the fowls.<lb>
Would you like to do it?&rdquo; and David offered a little<lb>
measure of oats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much;&rdquo; and Christie began to scatter the<lb>
grain, wondering who &ldquo;Kitty&rdquo; was.</p>
<p>As if he saw the wish in her face, David added,<lb>
while he shelled corn for the hens:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was the little girl who was with us last. Her<lb>
father kept her in a factory, and took all her wages,<lb>
barely giving her clothes and food enough to keep her<lb>
alive. The poor child ran away, and was trying to<lb>
hide when Mr. Power found and sent her here to be<lb>
cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he did me?&rdquo; said Christie quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that 's a way he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very kind and Christian way. Why didn't she<lb>
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="238">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was rather quiet for the lively little thing,<lb>
and rather too near the city, so we got a good place up<lb>
in the country where she could go to school and learn<lb>
housework. The mill had left her no time for these<lb>
things, and at fifteen she was as ignorant as a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must miss her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked like a little rose sometimes,&rdquo; and David<lb>
smiled to himself as he fed the gray hens.</p>
<p>Christie immediately made a picture of the &ldquo;lively<lb>
little thing&rdquo; with a face &ldquo;like a rose,&rdquo; and was uncomfortably<lb>
conscious that she did not look half as well<lb>
feeding doves as Kitty must have done.</p>
<p>Just then David handed her the basket, saying in the<lb>
paternal way that half amused, half piqued her: &ldquo;It<lb>
is getting too chilly for you here: take these in please,<lb>
and I 'll bring the milk directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of herself she smiled, as a sudden vision of<lb>
the elegant Mr. Fletcher, devotedly carrying her book<lb>
or beach-basket, passed through her mind; then hastened<lb>
to explain the smile, for David lifted his brows inquiringly,<lb>
and glanced about him to see what amused her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon: I 've lived alone so much that<lb>
it seems a little odd to be told to do things, even if<lb>
they are as easy and pleasant as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so used to taking care of people, and directing,<lb>
that I do so without thinking. I won't if you<lb>
don't like it,&rdquo; and he put out his hand to take back the<lb>
basket with a grave, apologetic air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do like it; only it amused me to be treated<lb>
like a little girl again, when I am nearly thirty, and<lb>
<pb n="239">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-250">

<figdesc>Page 239.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
feel seventy at least, life has been so hard to me<lb>
lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face sobered at the last words, and David's instantly<lb>
grew so pitiful she could not keep her eyes on<lb>
it lest they should fill, so suddenly did the memory of<lb>
past troubles overcome her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said in a tone that warmed her heart,<lb>
&ldquo;I know, but we are going to try, and make life easier<lb>
for you now, and you must feel that this is home and<lb>
we are friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; and Christie flushed with grateful feeling<lb>
and a little shame, as she went in, thinking to herself:<lb>
&ldquo;How silly I was to say that! I may have spoilt<lb>
the simple friendliness that was so pleasant, and have<lb>
made him think me a foolish stuck-up old creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever he might have thought, David's manner<lb>
was unchanged when he came in and found her busy<lb>
with the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's pleasant to see thee resting, mother, and every<lb>
thing going on so well,&rdquo; he said, glancing about the<lb>
room, where the old lady sat, and nodding toward the<lb>
kitchen, where Christie was toasting bread in her neatest<lb>
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Davy, it was about time I had a helper for thy<lb>
sake, at least; and this is a great improvement upon<lb>
heedless Kitty, I am inclined to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sterling dropped her voice over that last sentence;<lb>
but Christie heard it, and was pleased. A moment<lb>
or two later, David came toward her with a glass<lb>
in his hand, saying as if rather doubtful of his reception:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;New milk is part of the cure: will you try it?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="240">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-251">

<figdesc>Page 240.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>For the first time, Christie looked straight up in the<lb>
honest eyes that seemed to demand honesty in others,<lb>
and took the glass, answering heartily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you; I drink good health to you, and<lb>
better manners to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newly lighted lamp shone full in her face, and<lb>
though it was neither young nor blooming, it showed<lb>
something better than youth and bloom to one who<lb>
could read the subtle language of character as David<lb>
could. He nodded as he took the glass, and went away<lb>
saying quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are plain people here, and you won't find it<lb>
hard to get on with us, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he liked the candid look, and thought about it,<lb>
as he chopped kindlings, whistling with a vigor which<lb>
caused Christie to smile as she strained the milk.</p>
<p>After tea a spider-legged table was drawn out toward<lb>
the hearth, where an open fire burned cheerily, and<lb>
puss purred on the rug, with Bran near by. David<lb>
unfolded his newspapers, Mrs. Sterling pinned on her<lb>
knitting-sheath, and Christie sat a moment enjoying<lb>
the comfortable little scene. She sighed without knowing<lb>
it, and Mrs. Sterling asked quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is thee tired, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! only happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that: I was afraid thee would find it<lb>
dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's beautiful!&rdquo; then Christie checked herself, feeling<lb>
that these outbursts would not suit such quiet<lb>
people; and, half ashamed of showing how much she<lb>
felt, she added soberly, &ldquo;If you will give me something<lb>
to do I shall be quite contented.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="241">

<milestn unit="collation" n="11 P">
<p>&ldquo;Sewing is not good for thee. If thee likes to knit<lb>
I 'll set up a sock for thee to-morrow,&rdquo; said the old<lb>
lady well pleased at the industrious turn of her new<lb>
handmaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to darn, and I see some to be done in this<lb>
basket. May I do it?&rdquo; and Christie laid hold of the<lb>
weekly job which even the best housewives are apt to<lb>
set aside for pleasanter tasks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As thee likes, my dear. My eyes will not let me<lb>
sew much in the evening, else I should have finished<lb>
that batch to-night. Thee will find the yarn and<lb>
needles in the little bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Christie fell to work on gray socks, and neat<lb>
lavender-colored hose, while the old lady knit swiftly,<lb>
and David read aloud. Christie thought she was listening<lb>
to the report of a fine lecture; but her ear only<lb>
caught the words, for her mind wandered away into a<lb>
region of its own, and lived there till her task was done.<lb>
Then she laid the tidy pile in the basket, drew her<lb>
chair to a corner of the hearth, and quietly enjoyed<lb>
herself.</p>
<p>The cat, feeling sure of a welcome, got up into her<lb>
lap, and went to sleep in a cosy bunch; Bran laid his<lb>
nose across her feet, and blinked at her with sleepy<lb>
good-will, while her eyes wandered round the room,<lb>
from its quaint furniture and the dreaming flowers in<lb>
the windows, to the faces of its occupants, and lingered<lb>
there.</p>
<p>The plain border of a Quaker cap encircled that<lb>
mild old face, with bands of silver hair parted on a<lb>
forehead marked with many lines. But the eyes were<lb>
clear and sweet; winter roses bloomed in the cheeks,<lb>
<pb n="242">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-253">

<figdesc>Page 242.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and an exquisite neatness pervaded the small figure,<lb>
from the trim feet on the stool, to the soft shawl folded<lb>
about the shoulders, as only a Quakeress can fold one.<lb>
In Mrs. Sterling, piety and peace made old age lovely,<lb>
and the mere presence of this tranquil soul seemed to<lb>
fill the room with a reposeful charm none could resist.</p>
<p>The other face possessed no striking comeliness of<lb>
shape or color; but the brown, becoming beard made<lb>
it manly, and the broad arch of a benevolent brow<lb>
added nobility to features otherwise not beautiful, &mdash; a<lb>
face plainly expressing resolution and rectitude, inspiring<lb>
respect as naturally as a certain protective<lb>
kindliness of manner won confidence. Even in repose<lb>
wearing a vigilant look as if some hidden pain or<lb>
passion lay in wait to surprise and conquer the sober<lb>
cheerfulness that softened the lines of the firm-set lips,<lb>
and warmed the glance of the thoughtful eyes.</p>
<p>Christie fancied she possessed the key to this, and<lb>
longed to know all the story of the cross which Mr.<lb>
Power said David had learned to bear so well. Then<lb>
she began to wonder if they could like and keep her,<lb>
to hope so, and to feel that here at last she was at<lb>
home with friends. But the old sadness crept over her,<lb>
as she remembered how often she had thought this<lb>
before, and how soon the dream ended, the ties were<lb>
broken, and she adrift again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; she said within herself, &ldquo;I won't think<lb>
of the morrow, but take the good that comes and enjoy<lb>
it while I may. I must not disappoint Rachel, since<lb>
she kept her word so nobly to me. Dear soul, when<lb>
shall I see her again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of Rachel always touched her heart,<lb>
<pb n="243">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-254">

<figdesc>Page 243.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
more now than ever; and, as she leaned back in her<lb>
chair with closed eyes and idle hands, these tender<lb>
memories made her unconscious face most eloquent.<lb>
The eyes peering over the spectacles telegraphed a<lb>
meaning message to the other eyes glancing over the<lb>
paper now and then; and both these friends in deed as<lb>
well as name felt assured that this woman needed all<lb>
the comfort they could give her. But the busy needles<lb>
never stopped their click, and the sonorous voice read<lb>
on without a pause, so Christie never knew what mute<lb>
confidences passed between mother and son, or what<lb>
helpful confessions her traitorous face had made for her.</p>
<p>The clock struck nine, and these primitive people<lb>
prepared for rest; for their day began at dawn, and<lb>
much wholesome work made sleep a luxury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davy will tap at thy door as he goes down in the<lb>
morning, and I will soon follow to show thee about<lb>
matters. Good-night, and good rest, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, the little lady gave Christie a maternal<lb>
kiss; David shook handsl and then she went away,<lb>
wondering why service was so lightened by such little<lb>
kindnesses.</p>
<p>As she lay in her narrow white bed, with the &ldquo;pale<lb>
light of stars&rdquo; filling the quiet, cell-like room, and some<lb>
one playing softly on a flute overhead, she felt as if she<lb>
had left the troublous world behind her, and shutting<lb>
out want, solitude, and despair, had come into some<lb>
safe, secluded spot full of flowers and sunshine, kind<lb>
hearts, and charitable deeds.</p>

</p>
<p>FROM that day a new life began for Christie, a<lb>
happy, quiet, useful life, utterly unlike any of<lb>
the brilliant futures she had planned for herself; yet<lb>
indescribably pleasant to her now, for past experience<lb>
had taught her its worth, and made her ready to<lb>
enjoy it.</p>
<p>Never had spring seemed so early or so fair, never<lb>
had such a crop of hopeful thoughts and happy feelings<lb>
sprung up in her heart as now; and nowhere was<lb>
there a brighter face, a blither voice, or more willing<lb>
hands than Christie's when the apple blossoms came.</p>
<p>This was what she needed, the protection of a<lb>
home, wholesome cares and duties; and, best of all,<lb>
friends to live and labor for, loving and beloved. Her<lb>
whole soul was in her work now, and as health returned,<lb>
much of the old energy and cheerfulness came with it,<lb>
a little sobered, but more sweet and earnest than ever.<lb>
No task was too hard or humble; no day long enough<lb>
to do all she longed to do; and no sacrifice would have<lb>
seemed too great for those whom she regarded with<lb>
steadily increasing love and gratitude.</p>
<p>Up at dawn, the dewy freshness of the hour, the<lb>
<pb n="245">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-256">

<figdesc>Page 245.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
morning rapture of the birds, the daily miracle of sunrise,<lb>
set her heart in tune, and gave her Nature's most<lb>
healing balm. She kept the little house in order, with<lb>
Mrs. Sterling to direct and share the labor so pleasantly,<lb>
that mistress and maid soon felt like mother and<lb>
daughter, and Christie often said she did not care for<lb>
any other wages.</p>
<p>The house-work of this small family was soon done,<lb>
and then Christie went to tasks that she liked better.<lb>
Much out-of-door life was good for her, and in garden<lb>
and green-house there was plenty of light labor she<lb>
could do. So she grubbed contentedly in the wholesome<lb>
earth, weeding and potting, learning to prune<lb>
and bud, and finding Mrs. Wilkins was quite right in<lb>
her opinion of the sanitary virtues of dirt.</p>
<p>Trips to town to see the good woman and carry<lb>
country gifts to the little folks; afternoon drives with<lb>
Mrs. Sterling in the old-fashioned chaise, drawn by the<lb>
Roman-nosed horse, and Sunday pilgrimages to church<lb>
to be &ldquo;righted up&rdquo; by one of Mr. Power's stirring sermons,<lb>
were among her new pleasures. But, on the<lb>
whole, the evenings were her happiest times: for then<lb>
David read aloud while she worked; she sung to the<lb>
old piano tuned for her use; or, better still, as spring<lb>
came on, they sat in the porch, and talked as people<lb>
only do talk when twilight, veiling the outer world,<lb>
seems to lift the curtains of that inner world where<lb>
minds go exploring, hearts learn to know one another,<lb>
and souls walk together in the cool of the day.</p>
<p>At such times Christie seemed to catch glimpses of<lb>
another David than the busy, cheerful man apparently<lb>
contented with the humdrum duties of an<lb>
<pb n="246">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-257">

<figdesc>Page 246.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
obscure, laborious life, and the few unexciting pleasures<lb>
afforded by books, music, and much silent thought.<lb>
She sometimes felt with a woman's instinct that under<lb>
this composed, commonplace existence another life<lb>
went on; for, now and then, in the interest of conversation,<lb>
or the involuntary yielding to a confidential<lb>
impulse, a word, a look, a gesture, betrayed an unexpected<lb>
power and passion, a secret unrest, a bitter<lb>
memory that would not be ignored.</p>
<p>Only at rare moments did she catch these glimpses,<lb>
and so brief, so indistinct, were they that she half<lb>
believed her own lively fancy created them. She longed<lb>
to know more; but &ldquo;David's trouble&rdquo; made him sacred<lb>
in her eyes from any prying curiosity, and always after<lb>
one of these twilight betrayals Christie found him so<lb>
like his unromantic self next day, that she laughed and<lb>
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never shall outgrow my foolish way of trying to<lb>
make people other than they are. Gods are gone,<lb>
heroes hard to find, and one should be contented with<lb>
good men, even if they do wear old clothes, lead prosaic<lb>
lives, and have no accomplishments but gardening,<lb>
playing the flute, and keeping their temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt the influences of that friendly place at once;<lb>
but for a time she wondered at the natural way in<lb>
which kind things were done, the protective care extended<lb>
over her, and the confiding air with which these<lb>
people treated her. They asked no questions, demanded<lb>
no explanations, seemed unconscious of conferring<lb>
favors, and took her into their life so readily that she<lb>
marvelled, even while she rejoiced, at the good fortune<lb>
which led her there.</p>
<pb n="247">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-258">

<figdesc>Page 247.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>She understood this better when she discovered, what<lb>
Mr. Power had not mentioned, that the little cottage<lb>
was a sort of refuge for many women like herself; a<lb>
half-way house where they could rest and recover themselves<lb>
after the wrongs, defeats, and weariness that come<lb>
to such in the battle of life.</p>
<p>With a chivalry older and finer than any Spenser<lb>
sung, Mr. Power befriended these forlorn souls, and<lb>
David was his faithful squire. Whoever knocked at<lb>
that low door was welcomed, warmed, and fed; comforted,<lb>
and set on their way, cheered and strengthened<lb>
by the sweet good-will that made charity no burden,<lb>
and restored to the more desperate and despairing<lb>
their faith in human nature and God's love.</p>
<p>There are many such green spots in this world of<lb>
ours, which often seems so bad that a second Deluge<lb>
could hardly wash it clean again; and these beneficent,<lb>
unostentatious asylums are the salvation of more<lb>
troubled souls than many a great institution gilded all<lb>
over with the rich bequests of men who find themselves<lb>
too heavily laden to enter in at the narrow gate of<lb>
heaven.</p>
<p>Happy the foot-sore, heart-weary traveller who turns<lb>
from the crowded, dusty highway down the green lane<lb>
that leads to these humble inns, where the sign of the<lb>
Good Samaritan is written on the face of whomsoever<lb>
opens to the stranger, and refreshment for soul and<lb>
body is freely given in the name of Him who loved the<lb>
poor.</p>
<p>Mr. Power came now and then, for his large parish<lb>
left him but little time to visit any but the needy.<lb>
Christie enjoyed these brief visits heartily, for her new<lb>
<pb n="248">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-259">

<figdesc>Page 248.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
friends soon felt that she was one of them, and cordially<lb>
took her into the large circle of workers and<lb>
believers to which they belonged.</p>
<p>Mr. Power's heart was truly an orphan asylum, and<lb>
every lonely creature found a welcome there. He<lb>
could rebuke sin sternly, yet comfort and uplift the<lb>
sinner with fatherly compassion; righteous wrath would<lb>
flash from his eyes at injustice, and contempt sharpen<lb>
his voice as he denounced hypocrisy: yet the eyes<lb>
that lightened would dim with pity for a woman's<lb>
wrong, a child's small sorrow; and the voice that<lb>
thundered would whisper consolation like a mother, or<lb>
give counsel with a wisdom books cannot teach.</p>
<p>He was a Moses in his day and generation, born to<lb>
lead his people out of the bondage of dead superstitions,<lb>
and go before them through a Red Sea of persecution<lb>
into the larger liberty and love all souls hunger<lb>
for, and many are just beginning to find as they come<lb>
doubting, yet desiring, into the goodly land such pioneers<lb>
as he have planted in the wilderness.</p>
<p>He was like a tonic to weak natures and wavering<lb>
wills; and Christie felt a general revival going on within<lb>
herself as her knowledge, honor, and affection for him<lb>
grew. His strength seemed to uphold her; his integrity<lb>
to rebuke all unworthiness in her own life; and the<lb>
magic of his generous, genial spirit to make the hard<lb>
places smooth, the bitter things sweet, and the world<lb>
seem a happier, honester place than she had ever<lb>
thought it since her father died.</p>
<p>Mr. Power had been interested in her from the first;<lb>
had watched her through other eyes, and tried her by<lb>
various unsuspected tests. She stood them well;<lb>
<pb n="249">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-260">

<figdesc>Page 249.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="11*">
showed her faults as frankly as her virtues, and tried to<lb>
deserve their esteem by copying the excellencies she<lb>
admired in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is made of the right stuff, and we must keep<lb>
her among us; for she must not be lost or wasted by<lb>
being left to drift about the world with no ties to make<lb>
her safe and happy. She is doing so well here, let her<lb>
stay till the restless spirit begins to stir again; then<lb>
she shall come to me and learn contentment by seeing<lb>
greater troubles than her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Power said this one day as he rose to go, after<lb>
sitting an hour with Mrs. Sterling, and hearing from<lb>
her a good report of his new <hi rend="italics">prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.</hi> The young<lb>
people were out at work, and had not been called in to<lb>
see him, for the interview had been a confidential one.<lb>
But as he stood at the gate he saw Christie in the<lb>
strawberry bed, and went toward her, glad to see how<lb>
well and happy she looked.</p>
<p>Her hat was hanging on her shoulders, and the sun<lb>
giving her cheeks a healthy color; she was humming<lb>
to herself like a bee as her fingers flew, and once she<lb>
paused, shaded her eyes with her hand, and took a long<lb>
look at a figure down in the meadow; then she worked on<lb>
silent and smiling, &mdash; a pleasant creature to see, though<lb>
her hair was ruffled by the wind; her gingham gown<lb>
pinned up; and her fingers deeply stained with the<lb>
blood of many berries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that means any thing?&rdquo; thought Mr.<lb>
Power, with a keen glance from the distant man to the<lb>
busy woman close at hand. &ldquo;It might be a helpful,<lb>
happy thing for both, if poor David only could forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had time for no more castle-building, for a startled<lb>

robin flew away with a shrill chirp, and Christie looked<lb>
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I 'm so glad!&rdquo; she said, rising quickly. &ldquo;I was<lb>
picking a special box for you, and now you can have a<lb>
feast beside, just as you like it, fresh from the vines.<lb>

<p>&ldquo;This <hi rend="italics">is</hi> luxury!&rdquo; and Mr. Power sat down on the<lb>

his knee which Christie kept supplying with delicious<lb>
mouthfuls.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and how goes it? Are we still happy and contented<lb>
here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I had been born again; as if this was<lb>
a new heaven and a new earth, and every thing was<lb>
as it should be,&rdquo; answered Christie, with a look of perfect<lb>
satisfaction in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's a pleasant hearing. Mrs. Sterling has been<lb>
praising you, but I wanted to be sure you were as satisfied<lb>
as she. And how does David wear? well, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he is very good to me, and is teaching me<lb>
to be a gardener, so that I needn't kill myself with sewing<lb>
any more. Much of this is fine work for women,<lb>
and <hi rend="italics">so</hi> healthy. Don't I look a different creature from<lb>
the ghost that came here three or four months ago?&rdquo;<lb>
and she turned her face for inspection like a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, David is a good gardener. I often send my<lb>
sort of plants here, and he always makes them grow<lb>
and blossom sooner or later,&rdquo; answered Mr. Power, regarding<lb>
her like a beneficent genie on a three-legged<lb>
stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the fresh air, and Mrs. Sterling is the quiet<lb>
sunshine that does the work, I fancy. David only digs<lb>
about the roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for my share of the compliment; but<lb>
why say `only digs'? That is a most important part<lb>
of the work: I 'm afraid you don't appreciate David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do; but he rather aggravates me sometimes,&rdquo;<lb>
said Christie, laughing, as she put a particularly<lb>
big berry in the green plate to atone for her frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Mr. Power, interested in these little<lb>
revelations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he <hi rend="italics">won't</hi> be ambitious. I try to stir him up,<lb>
<pb n="252">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-263">

<figdesc>Page 252.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
for he has talents; I 've found that out: but he won't<lb>
seem to care for any thing but watching over his mother,<lb>
reading his old books, and making flowers bloom double<lb>
when they ought to be single.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are worse ambitions than those, Christie. I<lb>
know many a man who would be far better employed<lb>
in cherishing a sweet old woman, studying Plato, and<lb>
doubling the beauty of a flower, than in selling principles<lb>
for money, building up a cheap reputation that dies<lb>
with him, or chasing pleasures that turn to ashes in his<lb>
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but isn't it natural for a young man to<lb>
have some personal aim or aspiration to live for? If<lb>
David was a weak or dull man I could understand it;<lb>
but I seem to feel a power, a possibility for something<lb>
higher and better than any thing I see, and this frets<lb>
me. He is so good, I want him to be great also in<lb>
some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wise man says, `The essence of greatness is the<lb>
perception that virtue is enough.' <hi rend="italics">I</hi> think David one<lb>
of the most ambitious men I ever knew, because at<lb>
thirty he has discovered this truth, and taken it to<lb>
heart. Many men can be what the world calls great:<lb>
very few men are what God calls good. This is the<lb>
harder task to choose, yet the only success that satisfies,<lb>
the only honor that outlives death. These faithful<lb>
lives, whether seen of men or hidden in corners, are<lb>
the salvation of the world, and few of us fail to acknowledge<lb>
it in the hours when we are brought close<lb>
to the heart of things, and see a little as God sees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie did not speak for a moment: Mr. Power's<lb>
voice had been so grave, and his words so earnest that<lb>
<pb n="253">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-264">

<figdesc>Page 253.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
she could not answer lightly, but sat turning over the<lb>
new thoughts in her mind. Presently she said, in a<lb>
penitent but not quite satisfied tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are right, sir. I 'll try not to care for<lb>
the outward and visible signs of these hidden virtues;<lb>
but I 'm afraid I still shall have a hankering for the<lb>
worldly honors that are so valued by most people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;`Success and glory are the children of hard work<lb>
and God's favor,' according to &aelig;schylus, and you will<lb>
find he was right. David got a heavy blow some years<lb>
ago as I told you, I think; and he took it hard, but it<lb>
did not spoil him: it made a man of him; and, if I am<lb>
not much mistaken, he will yet do something to be<lb>
proud of, though the world may never hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; and Christie's face brightened at the<lb>
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless you look as if you doubted it, O you<lb>
of little faith. Every one has two sides to his nature:<lb>
David has shown you the least interesting one, and<lb>
you judge accordingly. I think he will show you the<lb>
other side some day, &mdash; for you are one of the women<lb>
who win confidence without trying, &mdash; and then you<lb>
will know the real David. Don't expect too much, or<lb>
quarrel with the imperfections that make him human;<lb>
but take him for what he is worth, and help him if you<lb>
can to make his life a brave and good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo; answered Christie so meekly that Mr.<lb>
Power laughed; for this confessional in the strawberry<lb>
bed amused him very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a hero-worshipper, my dear; and if people<lb>
don't come up to the mark you are so disappointed that<lb>
you fail to see the fine reality which remains when the<lb>
<pb n="254">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-265">

<figdesc>Page 254.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
pretty romance ends. Saints walk about the world to-day<lb>
as much as ever, but instead of haircloth and halos<lb>
they now wear&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broadcloth and wide-brimmed hats,&rdquo; added Christie,<lb>
looking up as if she had already found a better<lb>
St. Thomas than any the church ever canonized.</p>
<p>He thanked her with a smile, and went on with a<lb>
glance toward the meadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And knights go crusading as gallantly as ever<lb>
against the giants and the dragons, though you don't<lb>
discover it, because, instead of banner, lance, and shield<lb>
they carry&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bushel-baskets, spades, and sweet-flag for their<lb>
mothers,&rdquo; put in Christie again, as David came up the<lb>
path with the loam he had been digging.</p>
<p>Both began to laugh, and he joined in the merriment<lb>
without knowing why, as he put down his load, took off<lb>
his hat, and shook hands with his honored guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What 's the joke?&rdquo; he asked, refreshing himself<lb>
with the handful of berries Christie offered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't tell,&rdquo; she whispered, looking dismayed at the<lb>
idea of letting him know what she had said of him.</p>
<p>But Mr. Power answered tranquilly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were talking about coins, and Christie was expressing<lb>
her opinion of one I showed her. The face<lb>
and date she understands; but the motto puzzles her,<lb>
and she has not seen the reverse side yet, so does<lb>
not know its value. She will some day; and then she<lb>
will agree with me, I think, that it is <hi rend="italics">sterling</hi> gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emphasis on the last words enlightened David:<lb>
his sunburnt cheek reddened, but he only shook his<lb>
head, saying: &ldquo;She will find a brass farthing I 'm afraid,<lb>
<pb n="255">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-266">

<figdesc>Page 255.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sir,&rdquo; and began to crumble a handful of loam about the<lb>
roots of a carnation that seemed to have sprung up by<lb>
chance at the foot of the apple-tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did that get there?&rdquo; asked Christie, with sudden<lb>
interest in the flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It dropped when I was setting out the others, took<lb>
root, and looked so pretty and comfortable that I left<lb>
it. These waifs sometimes do better than the most<lb>
carefully tended ones: I only dig round them a bit and<lb>
leave them to sun and air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Power looked at Christie with so much meaning<lb>
in his face that it was her turn to color now. But with<lb>
feminine perversity she would not won herself mistaken,<lb>
and answered with eyes as full of meaning as his own:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the single ones best: double-carnations are<lb>
so untidy, all bursting out of the calyx as if the petals<lb>
had quarrelled and could not live together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The single ones are seldom perfect, and look poor<lb>
and incomplete with little scent or beauty,&rdquo; said unconscious<lb>
David propping up the thin-leaved flower,<lb>
that looked like a pale solitary maiden, beside the great<lb>
crimson and white carnations near by, filling the air<lb>
with spicy odor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect you will change your mind by and by,<lb>
Christie, as your taste improves, and you will learn to<lb>
think the double ones the handsomest,&rdquo; added Mr.<lb>
Power, wondering in his benevolent heart if he would<lb>
ever be the gardener to mix the colors of the two human<lb>
plants before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; and David shouldered his basket as if<lb>
he felt he might be in the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So must I, or they will be waiting for me at the<lb>
<pb n="256">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-267">

<figdesc>Page 256.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
hospital. Give me a handful of flowers, David: they<lb>
often do the poor souls more good than my prayers or<lb>
preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they went away, and left Christie sitting in the<lb>
strawberry bed, thinking that David looked less than<lb>
ever like a hero with his blue shirt, rough straw hat,<lb>
and big boots; also wondering if he <hi rend="italics">would</hi> ever show<lb>
her his best side, and if she would like it when she<lb>
saw it.</p>

</p>
<p>ON the fourth of September, Christie woke up, saying<lb>
to herself: &ldquo;It is my birthday, but no one<lb>
knows it, so I shall get no presents. Ah, well, I 'm<lb>
too old for that now, I suppose;&rdquo; but she sighed as she<lb>
said it, for well she knew one never is too old to be<lb>
remembered and beloved.</p>
<p>Just then the door opened, and Mrs. Sterling entered,<lb>
carrying what looked very like a pile of snow-flakes in<lb>
her arms. Laying this upon the bed, she kissed Christie,<lb>
saying with a tone and gesture that made the words<lb>
a benediction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A happy birthday, and God bless thee, my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Christie could do more than hug both gift and<lb>
giver, a great bouquet came flying in at the open window,<lb>
aimed with such skill that it fell upon the bed,<lb>
while David's voice called out from below: &ldquo;A happy<lb>
birthday, Christie, and many of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sweet, how kind of you, this is! I didn't dream<lb>
you knew about to-day, and never thought of such a<lb>
beautiful surprise,&rdquo; cried Christie, touched and charmed<lb>
by this unexpected celebration.</p>
<pb n="258">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-269">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee mentioned it once long ago, and we remembered.<lb>
They are very humble gifts, my dear; but we<lb>
could not let the day pass without some token of the<lb>
thanks we owe thee for these months of faithful service<lb>
and affectionate companionship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie had no answer to this little address, and was<lb>
about to cry as the only adequate expression of her<lb>
feelings, when a hearty &ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; from below<lb>
made her laugh, and call out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You conspirators! how dare you lay plots, and then<lb>
exult over me when I can't find words to thank you?<lb>
I always did think you were a set of angels, and now<lb>
I 'm quite sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee may be right about Davy, but <hi rend="italics">I</hi> am only a<lb>
prudent old woman, and have taken much pleasure<lb>
in privately knitting this light wrap to wear when thee<lb>
sits in the porch, for the evenings will soon grow chilly.<lb>
My son did not know what to get, and finally decided<lb>
that flowers would suit thee best; so he made a bunch<lb>
of those thee loves, and would toss it in as if he was a<lb>
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that way, and both my presents suit me exactly,&rdquo;<lb>
said Christie, wrapping the fleecy shawl about<lb>
her, and admiring the nosegay in which her quick eye<lb>
saw all her favorites, even to a plumy spray of the<lb>
little wild asters which she loved so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, child, I will step down, and see about breakfast.<lb>
Take thy time; for this is to be a holiday, and we<lb>
mean to make it a happy one if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the old lady went away, and Christie soon<lb>
followed, looking very fresh and blithe as she ran down<lb>
smiling behind her great bouquet. David was in the<lb>
<pb n="259">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-270">

<figdesc>Page 259.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
porch, training up the morning-glories that bloomed<lb>
late and lovely in that sheltered spot. He turned as<lb>
she approached, held out his hand, and bent a little as<lb>
if he was moved to add a tenderer greeting. But he<lb>
did not, only held the hand she gave him for a moment,<lb>
as he said with the paternal expression unusually<lb>
visible:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished you many happy birthdays; and, if you<lb>
go on getting younger every year like this, you will<lb>
surely have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first compliment he had ever paid her, and<lb>
she liked it, though she shook her head as if disclaiming<lb>
it, and answered brightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to think many years would be burdensome,<lb>
and just before I came here I felt as if I could not bear<lb>
another one. But now I like to live, and hope I shall<lb>
a long, long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm glad of that; and how do you mean to spend<lb>
these long years of yours?&rdquo; asked David, brushing<lb>
back the lock of hair that was always falling into his<lb>
eyes, as if he wanted to see more clearly the hopeful<lb>
face before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In doing what your morning-glories do, &mdash; climb up<lb>
as far and as fast as I can before the frost comes,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Christie, looking at the pretty symbols she had<lb>
chosen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got on a good way already then,&rdquo; began<lb>
David, smiling at her fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I haven't!&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;I 'm only<lb>
about half way up. See here: I 'll tell how it is;&rdquo; and,<lb>
pointing to the different parts of the flowery wall, she<lb>
added in her earnest way: &ldquo;I 've watched these grow,<lb>
<pb n="260">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-271">

<figdesc>Page 260.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and had many thoughts about them, as I sit sewing in<lb>
the porch. These variegated ones down low are my<lb>
childish fancies; most of them gone to seed you see.<lb>
These lovely blue ones of all shades are my girlish<lb>
dreams and hopes and plans. Poor things! some are<lb>
dead, some torn by the wind, and only a few pale ones<lb>
left quite perfect. Here you observe they grow sombre<lb>
with a tinge of purple; that means pain and gloom,<lb>
and there is where I was when I came here. Now<lb>
they turn from those sad colors to crimson, rose, and<lb>
soft pink. That 's the happiness and health I found here.<lb>
You and your dear mother planted them, and you see<lb>
how strong and bright they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted up her hand, and gathering one of the<lb>
great rosy cups offered it to him, as if it were brimful<lb>
of the thanks she could not utter. He comprehended,<lb>
took it with a quiet &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and stood looking<lb>
at it for a moment, as if her little compliment pleased<lb>
him very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these?&rdquo; he said presently, pointing to the<lb>
delicate violet bells that grew next the crimson ones.</p>
<p>The color deepened a shade in Christie's cheek, but<lb>
she went on with no other sign of shyness; for with<lb>
David she always spoke out frankly, because she could<lb>
not help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those mean love to me, not passion: the deep red<lb>
ones half hidden under the leaves mean that. My<lb>
violet flowers are the best and purest love we can<lb>
know: the sort that makes life beautiful and lasts for<lb>
ever. The white ones that come next are tinged with<lb>
that soft color here and there, and they mean holiness.<lb>
I know there will be love in heaven; so, whether I<lb>
<pb n="261">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-272">

<figdesc>Page 261.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
ever find it here or not, I am sure I shall not miss it<lb>
wholly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if glad to leave the theme that never can<lb>
be touched without reverent emotion by a true woman,<lb>
she added, looking up to where a few spotless blossoms<lb>
shone like silver in the light:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far away there in the sunshine are my highest<lb>
aspirations. I cannot reach them: but I can look up,<lb>
and see their beauty; believe in them, and try to follow<lb>
where they lead; remember that frost comes latest to<lb>
those that bloom the highest; and keep my beautiful<lb>
white flowers as long as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mush is ready; come to breakfast, children,&rdquo;<lb>
called Mrs. Sterling, as she crossed the hall with a tea-pot<lb>
in her hand.</p>
<p>Christie's face fell, then she exclaimed laughing:<lb>
&ldquo;That 's always the way; I never take a poetic flight<lb>
but in comes the mush, and spoils it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit; and that 's where women are mistaken.<lb>
Souls and bodies should go on together; and you will<lb>
find that a hearty breakfast won't spoil the little hymn<lb>
the morning-glories sung;&rdquo; and David set her a good<lb>
example by eating two bowls of hasty-pudding and<lb>
milk, with the lovely flower in his button-hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what are we to do next?&rdquo; asked Christie,<lb>
when the usual morning work was finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about ten minutes thee will see, I think,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Mrs. Sterling, glancing at the clock, and smiling<lb>
at the bright expectant look in the younger woman's<lb>
eyes.</p>
<p>She did see; for in less than ten minutes the rumble<lb>
of an omnibus was heard, a sound of many voices, and<lb>
<pb n="262">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-273">

<figdesc>Page 262.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
then the whole Wilkins brood came whooping down<lb>
the lane. It was good to see Ma Wilkins jog ponderously<lb>
after in full state and festival array; her bonnet<lb>
trembling with bows, red roses all over her gown, and<lb>
a parasol of uncommon brilliancy brandished joyfully<lb>
in her hand. It was better still to see her hug Christie,<lb>
when the latter emerged, flushed and breathless, from<lb>
the chaos of arms, legs, and chubby faces in which she<lb>
was lost for several tumultuous moments; and it was<lb>
best of all to see the good woman place her cherished<lb>
&ldquo;bunnit&rdquo; in the middle of the parlor table as a choice<lb>
and lovely ornament, administer the family pocket-handkerchief<lb>
all round, and then settle down with a<lb>
hearty:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, now, Mis Sterlin', you've no idee how tickled<lb>
we all was when Mr. David came, and told us you was<lb>
goin' to have a galy here to-day. It was so kind of<lb>
providential, for 'Lisha was invited out to a day's<lb>
pleasurin', so I could leave jest as wal as not. The<lb>
children 's ben hankerin' to come the wust kind, and go<lb>
plummin' as they did last month, though I told 'em berries<lb>
was gone weeks ago. I reelly thought I 'd never<lb>
get 'em here whole, they trained so in that bus. Wash<lb>
would go on the step, and kep fallin' off; Gusty's hat<lb>
blew out a winder; them two bad boys tumbled round<lb>
loose; and dear little Victory set like a lady, only I<lb>
found she 'd got both feet in the basket right atop of<lb>
the birthday cake, I made a puppose for Christie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn't hurt it a bit; there was a cloth over it,<lb>
and I like it all the better for the marks of Totty's<lb>
little feet, bless 'em!&rdquo; and Christie cuddled the culprit<lb>
with one hand while she revealed the damaged<lb>
<pb n="263">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-274">

<figdesc>Page 263.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
delicacy with the other, wondering inwardly what evil<lb>
star was always in the ascendant when Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
made cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear, you jest go and have a good frolic<lb>
with them children, I 'm a goin' to git dinner, and you<lb>
a goin' to play; so we don't want to see no more of<lb>
you till the bell rings,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins pinning up<lb>
her gown, and &ldquo;shooing&rdquo; her brood out of the room,<lb>
which they entirely filled.</p>
<p>Catching up her hat Christie obeyed, feeling as much<lb>
like a child as any of the excited six. The revels<lb>
that followed no pen can justly record, for Goths and<lb>
Vandals on the rampage but feebly describes the youthful<lb>
Wilkinses when their spirits effervesced after a<lb>
month's bottling up in close home quarters.</p>
<p>David locked the greenhouse door the instant he<lb>
saw them; and pervaded the premises generally like<lb>
a most affable but very watchful policeman, for the ravages<lb>
those innocents committed much afflicted him.<lb>
Yet he never had the heart to say a word of reproof,<lb>
when he saw their raptures over dandelions, the relish<lb>
with which they devoured fruit, and the good it did the<lb>
little souls and bodies to enjoy unlimited liberty, green<lb>
grass, and country air, even for a day.</p>
<p>Christie usually got them into the big meadow as<lb>
soon as possible, and there let them gambol at will;<lb>
while she sat on the broken bough of an apple-tree,<lb>
and watched her flock like an old-fashioned shepherdess.<lb>
To-day she did so; and when the children were happily<lb>
sailing boats, tearing to and fro like wild colts, or discovering<lb>
the rustic treasures Nurse Nature lays ready<lb>
to gladden little hearts and hands, Christie sat idly<lb>

making a garland of green brakes, and ruddy sumach<lb>
leaves ripened before the early frosts had come.</p>
<p>David saw her there, and, feeling that he might come<lb>
off guard for a time, went strolling down to lean upon<lb>
the wall, and chat in the friendly fashion that had naturally<lb>
grown up between these fellow-workers. She was<lb>
waiting for the new supply of ferns little Adelaide was<lb>
getting for her by the wall; and while she waited she<lb>

sat resting her cheek upon her hand, and smiling to<lb>
herself, as if she saw some pleasant picture in the green<lb>
grass at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder what she 's thinking about,&rdquo; said<lb>
David's voice close by, and Christie straightway answered:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip Fletcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; asked David, settling his elbow<lb>
in a comfortable niche between the mossy stones, so<lb>
that he could &ldquo;lean and loaf&rdquo; at his ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brother of the lady whose children I took care<lb>
of;&rdquo; and Christie wished she had thought before she<lb>
answered that first question, for in telling her adventures<lb>
at different times she had omitted all mention of<lb>
this gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell about him, as the children say: your experiences<lb>
are always interesting, and you look as if this<lb>
man was uncommonly entertaining in some way,&rdquo; said<lb>
David, indolently inclined to be amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no, not at all entertaining! invalids seldom<lb>
are, and he was sick and lazy, conceited and very cross<lb>
sometimes.&rdquo; Christie's heart rather smote her as she said<lb>
this, remembering the last look poor Fletcher gave her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice man to be sure; but I don't see any thing to<lb>
smile about,&rdquo; persisted David, who liked reasons for<lb>
things; a masculine trait often very trying to feminine<lb>
minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of a little quarrel we once had. He<lb>
found out that I had been an actress; for I basely did<lb>
not mention that fact when I took the place, and so got<lb>
properly punished for my deceit. I thought he 'd tell<lb>
his sister of course, so I did it myself, and retired from<lb>

the situation as much disgusted with Christie Devon as<lb>
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought to be, but I don't find that I am.<lb>
Do you know I think that old Fletcher was a sneak?&rdquo;<lb>
and David looked as if he would rather like to mention<lb>
his opinion to that gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably thought he was doing his duty to the<lb>
children: few people would approve of an actress for a<lb>
teacher you know. He had seen me play, and remembered<lb>
it all of a sudden, and told me of it: that was the<lb>
way it came about,&rdquo; said Christie hastily, feeling that<lb>
she must get out of the scrape as soon as possible, or<lb>
she would be driven to tell every thing in justice to Mr.<lb>
Fletcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see you act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You a Quaker, and express such a worldly and<lb>
dreadful wish?&rdquo; cried Christie, much amused, and very<lb>
grateful that his thoughts had taken a new direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm not, and never have been. Mother married out<lb>
of the sect, and, though she keeps many of her old ways,<lb>
always left me free to believe what I chose. I wear<lb>
drab because I like it, and say `thee' to her because<lb>
she likes it, and it is pleasant to have a little word all<lb>
our own. I 've been to theatres, but I don't care much<lb>
for them. Perhaps I should if I 'd had Fletcher's luck<lb>
in seeing <hi rend="italics">you</hi> play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn't lose much: I was not a good actress;<lb>
though now and then when I liked my part I did pretty<lb>
well they said,&rdquo; answered Christie, modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you go back after the accident?&rdquo; asked<lb>
David, who had heard that part of the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt that it was bad for me, and so retired to private<lb>
life.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever regret it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes when the restless fit is on me: but not<lb>
so often now as I used to do; for on the whole I 'd<lb>
rather <hi rend="italics">be</hi> a woman than <hi rend="italics">act</hi> a queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said David, and then added persuasively:<lb>
&ldquo;But you <hi rend="italics">will</hi> play for me some time: won't you? I 've<lb>
a curious desire to see you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I 'll try,&rdquo; replied Christie, flattered by his<lb>
interest, and not unwilling to display her little talent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you making that for? it 's very pretty,&rdquo;<lb>
asked David, who seemed to be in an inquiring frame<lb>
of mind that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one who wants it. I only do it for the pleasure:<lb>
I always liked pretty things; but, since I have lived<lb>
among flowers and natural people, I seem to care more<lb>
than ever for beauty of all kinds, and love to make it if I<lb>
can without stopping for any reason but the satisfaction,&rdquo;<lb>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;`Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,</l>
<l>&ldquo;`Then beauty is its own excuse for being,&rdquo;'</l>
</lg></q>
observed David, who had a weakness for poetry, and,<lb>
finding she liked his sort, quoted to Christie almost as<lb>
freely as to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, so look at that and enjoy it,&rdquo; and she<lb>
pointed to the child standing knee-deep in graceful<lb>
ferns, looking as if she grew there, a living buttercup,<lb>
with her buff frock off at one plump shoulder and her<lb>
bright hair shining in the sun.</p>
<p>Before David could express his admiration, the little<lb>
picture was spoilt; for Christie called out, &ldquo;Come, Vic,<lb>
bring me some more pretties!&rdquo; startling baby so that<lb>
she lost her balance, and disappeared with a muffled<lb>
<pb n="268">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-279">

<figdesc>Page 268.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
cry, leaving nothing to be seen but a pair of small convulsive<lb>
shoes, soles uppermost, among the brakes. David<lb>
took a leap, reversed Vic, and then let her compose<lb>
her little feelings by sticking bits of green in all the<lb>
button-holes of his coat, as he sat on the wall while she<lb>
stood beside him in the safe shelter of his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very like an Englishman,&rdquo; said Christie,<lb>
after watching the pair for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked David, looking surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were several in our company, and I found<lb>
them very much alike. Blunt and honest, domestic and<lb>
kind; hard to get at, but true as steel when once won;<lb>
not so brilliant and original as Americans, perhaps, but<lb>
more solid and steadfast. On the whole, I think them<lb>
the manliest men in the world,&rdquo; answered Christie, in<lb>
the decided way young people have of expressing their<lb>
opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you had known and studied a great<lb>
variety of men,&rdquo; said David, feeling that he need not<lb>
resent the comparison she had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, and it has done me good. Women who<lb>
stand alone in the world, and have their own way to<lb>
make, have a better chance to know men truly than<lb>
those who sit safe at home and only see one side of<lb>
mankind. We lose something; but I think we gain a<lb>
great deal that is more valuable than admiration, flattery,<lb>
and the superficial service most men give to our<lb>
sex. Some one says, `Companionship teaches men and<lb>
women to know, judge, and treat one another justly.'<lb>
I believe it; for we who are compelled to be fellow-workers<lb>
with men understand and value them more<lb>
truly than many a belle who has a dozen lovers<lb>
<pb n="269">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-280">

<figdesc>Page 269.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
sighing at her feet. I see their faults and follies; but I also<lb>
see so much to honor, love, and trust, that I feel as if<lb>
the world was full of brothers. Yes, as a general rule,<lb>
men have been kinder to me than women; and if I<lb>
wanted a staunch friend I 'd choose a man, for they<lb>
wear better than women, who ask too much, and cannot<lb>
see that friendship lasts longer if a little respect and<lb>
reserve go with the love and confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie had spoken soberly, with no thought of flattery<lb>
or effect; for the memory of many kindnesses<lb>
bestowed on her by many men, from rough Joe Butterfield<lb>
to Mr. Power, gave warmth and emphasis to her<lb>
words.</p>
<p>The man sitting on the wall appreciated the compliment<lb>
to his sex, and proved that he deserved his share<lb>
of it by taking it exactly as she meant it, and saying<lb>
heartily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that, Christie, and wish more women thought<lb>
and spoke as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they had had my experience they would, and not<lb>
be ashamed of it. I am so old now I can say these things<lb>
and not be misjudged; for even some sensible people<lb>
think this honest sort of fellowship impossible if not improper.<lb>
I don't, and I never shall, so if I can ever do<lb>
any thing for you, David, forget that I am a woman and<lb>
tell me as freely as if I was a younger brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I; you 'd make a splendid elder brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a very bad one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden sharpness in David's voice that<lb>
jarred on Christie's ear and made her look up quickly.<lb>
She only caught a glimpse of his face, and saw that it<lb>
<pb n="270">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-281">

<figdesc>Page 270.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
was strangely troubled, as he swung himself over the<lb>
wall with little Vic on his arm and went toward the<lb>
house, saying abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby 's sleepy: she must go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie sat some time longer, wondering what she<lb>
had said to disturb him, and when the bell rang went<lb>
in still perplexed. But David looked as usual, and the<lb>
only trace of disquiet was an occasional hasty shaking<lb>
back of the troublesome lock, and a slight knitting of<lb>
the brows; two tokens, as she had learned to know,<lb>
of impatience or pain.</p>
<p>She was soon so absorbed in feeding the children,<lb>
hungry and clamorous as young birds for their food,<lb>
that she forgot every thing else. When dinner was<lb>
done and cleared away, she devoted herself to Mrs.<lb>
Wilkins for an hour or two, while Mrs. Sterling took<lb>
her nap, the infants played riotously in the lane, and<lb>
David was busy with orders.</p>
<p>The arrival of Mr. Power drew every one to the<lb>
porch to welcome him. As he handed Christie a book,<lb>
he asked with a significant smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found him yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at the title of the new gift, read &ldquo;Heroes<lb>
and Hero-worship,&rdquo; and answered merrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, but I'm looking hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success to your search,&rdquo; and Mr. Power turned to<lb>
greet David, who approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what shall we play?&rdquo; asked Christie, as the<lb>
children gathered about her demanding to be amused.</p>
<p>George Washington suggested leap-frog, and the<lb>
others added equally impracticable requests; but Mrs.<lb>
Wilkins settled the matter by saying:</p>
<pb n="271">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-282">

<figdesc>Page 271.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let 's have some play-actin', Christie. That used<lb>
to tickle the children amazin'ly, and I was never tired<lb>
of hearin' them pieces, specially the solemn ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! do the funny girl with the baby, and the<lb>
old woman, and the lady that took pison and had fits!&rdquo;<lb>
shouted the children, charmed with the idea.</p>
<p>Christie felt ready for any thing just then, and gave<lb>
them Tilly Slowboy, Miss Miggs, and Mrs. Gummage,<lb>
in her best style, while the young folks rolled on the<lb>
grass in ecstasies, and Mrs. Wilkins laughed till she<lb>
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now a touch of tragedy!&rdquo; said Mr. Power, who sat<lb>
under the elm, with David leaning on the back of his<lb>
chair, both applauding heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insatiable people! do you expect me to give<lb>
you low comedy and heavy tragedy all alone? I 'm<lb>
equal to melodrama I think, and I 'll give you Miss St.<lb>
Clair as Juliet, if you wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie stepped into the house, and soon reappeared<lb>
with a white table-cloth draped about her, two dishevelled<lb>
locks of hair on her shoulders, and the vinegar<lb>
cruet in her hand, that being the first bottle she could<lb>
find. She meant to burlesque the poison scene, and<lb>
began in the usual ranting way; but she soon forgot St.<lb>
Clair in poor Juliet, and did it as she had often longed<lb>
to do it, with all the power and passion she possessed.<lb>
Very faulty was her rendering, but the earnestness she<lb>
put into it made it most effective to her uncritical audience,<lb>
who &ldquo;brought down the house,&rdquo; when she fell<lb>
upon the grass with her best stage drop, and lay there<lb>
getting her breath after the mouthful of vinegar she<lb>
had taken in the excitement of the moment.</p>
<pb n="272">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-283">

<figdesc>Page 272.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>She was up again directly, and, inspired by this<lb>
superb success, ran in and presently reappeared as Lady<lb>
Macbeth with Mrs. Wilkins's scarlet shawl for royal<lb>
robes, and the leafy chaplet of the morning for a crown.<lb>
She took the stage with some difficulty, for the unevenness<lb>
of the turf impaired the majesty of her tragic<lb>
stride, and fixing her eyes on an invisible Thane (who<lb>
cut his part shamefully, and spoke in the gruffest of<lb>
gruff voices) she gave them the dagger scene.</p>
<p>David as the orchestra, had been performing a drum<lb>
solo on the back of a chair with two of the corn-cobs<lb>
Victoria had been building houses with; but, when<lb>
Lady Macbeth said, &ldquo;Give <hi rend="italics">me</hi> the daggers,&rdquo; Christie<lb>
plucked the cobs suddenly from his hands, looking so<lb>
fiercely scornful, and lowering upon him so wrathfully<lb>
with her corked brows that he ejaculated an involuntary,<lb>
&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; as he stepped back quite daunted.</p>
<p>Being in the spirit of her part, Christie closed with<lb>
the sleep-walking scene, using the table-cloth again,<lb>
while a towel composed the tragic nightcap of her<lb>
ladyship. This was an imitation, and having a fine<lb>
model and being a good mimic, she did well; for the<lb>
children sat staring with round eyes, the gentlemen<lb>
watched the woful face and gestures intently, and<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins took a long breath at the end, exclaiming:<lb>
&ldquo;I never did see the beat of that for gastliness!<lb>
My sister Clarissy used to walk in her sleep, but she<lb>
warn't half so kind of dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had had the murder of a few friends on her<lb>
conscience, I dare say she would have been,&rdquo; said Christie,<lb>
going in to make herself tidy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you like her as an actress?&rdquo; asked<lb>
<pb n="273">

<milestn unit="collation" n="12* R">
Mr. Power of David, who stood looking, as if he still<lb>
saw and heard the haunted lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much; but better as a woman. I 'd no idea<lb>
she had it in her,&rdquo; answered David, in a wonder-stricken<lb>
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of tragedy and comedy in all of us,&rdquo; began<lb>
Mr. Power; but David said hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but few of us have passion and imagination<lb>
enough to act Shakespeare in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true: Christie herself could not give a whole<lb>
character in that style, and would not think of trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> think she could; and I 'd like to see her try it,&rdquo;<lb>
said David, much impressed by the dramatic ability<lb>
which Christie's usual quietude had most effectually<lb>
hidden.</p>
<p>He was still thinking about it, when she came out<lb>
again. Mr. Power beckoned to her, saying, as she<lb>
came and stood before him, flushed and kindled with<lb>
her efforts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you must give me a bit from the `Merchant of<lb>
Venice.' Portia is a favorite character of mine, and I<lb>
want to see if you can do any thing with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I cannot. I used to study it, but it was<lb>
too sober to suit me. I am not a judicial woman, so I<lb>
gave it up,&rdquo; answered Christie, much flattered by his<lb>
request, and amused at the respectful way in which<lb>
David looked at her. Then, as if it just occurred to<lb>
her, she added, &ldquo;I remember one little speech that I<lb>
can say to <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> sir, with great truth, and I will, since<lb>
you like that play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still standing before him, she bent her head a little,<lb>
and with a graceful gesture of the hands, as if offering<lb>
<pb n="274">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-285">

<figdesc>Page 274.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
something, she delivered with heartfelt emphasis the<lb>
first part of Portia's pretty speech to her fortunate<lb>
suitor:</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,</l>
<l>Such as I am: though, for myself alone,</l>
<l>I would not be ambitious in my wish,</l>
<l>To wish myself much better; yet for you,</l>
<l>I would be trebled twenty times myself;</l>
<l>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;</l>
<l>That, only to stand high in your account,</l>
<l>I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,</l>
<l>Exceed account: but the full sum of me</l>
<l>Is sum of something; which, to term in gross,</l>
<l>Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractis'd: &mdash;</l>
<l>Happy in this, she is not yet so old</l>
<l>But she may learn; happier than this,</l>
<l>She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</l>
<l>Happiest of all, is that her willing spirit</l>
<l>Commits itself to yours to be directed,</l>
<l>As from her lord, her governor, her king.&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
<p>David applauded vigorously; but Mr. Power rose<lb>
silently, looking both touched and surprised; and, drawing<lb>
Christie's hand through his arm, led her away into<lb>
the garden for one of the quiet talks that were so much<lb>
to her.</p>
<p>When they returned, the Wilkinses were preparing<lb>
to depart; and, after repeated leave-takings, finally<lb>
got under way, were packed into the omnibus, and<lb>
rumbled off with hats, hands, and handkerchiefs waving<lb>
from every window. Mr. Power soon followed,<lb>
and peace returned to the little house in the lane.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, when Mrs. Sterling was engaged<lb>
with a neighbor, who had come to confide some<lb>
<pb n="275">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-286">

<figdesc>Page 275.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
affliction to the good lady, Christie went into the porch,<lb>
and found David sitting on the step, enjoying the mellow<lb>
moonlight and the balmy air. As he did not speak,<lb>
she sat down silently, folded her hands in her lap, and<lb>
began to enjoy the beauty of the night in her own way.<lb>
Presently she became conscious that David's eyes had<lb>
turned from the moon to her own face. He sat in the<lb>
shade, she in the light, and he was looking at her with<lb>
the new expression which amused her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it? You look as if you never saw<lb>
me before,&rdquo; she said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I never hand,&rdquo; he answered, still regarding<lb>
her as if she had been a picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A peaceful, pious nun, just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is owing to my pretty shawl. I put it on<lb>
in honor of the day, though it is a trifle warm, I confess.&rdquo;<lb>
And Christie stroked the soft folds about her<lb>
shoulders, and settled the corner that lay lightly on her<lb>
hair. &ldquo;I do feel peaceful to-night, but not pious. I<lb>
am afraid I never shall do that,&rdquo; she added soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it does not seem to be my nature, and I<lb>
don't know how to change it. I want something to<lb>
keep me steady, but I can't find it. So I whiffle about<lb>
this way and that, and sometimes think I am a most<lb>
degenerate creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is only human nature, so don't be troubled.<lb>
We are all compasses pointing due north. We get<lb>
shaken often, and the needle varies in spite of us; but<lb>
the minute we are quiet, it points right, and we have<lb>
only to follow it.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="276">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-287">

<figdesc>Page 276.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The keeping quiet is just what I cannot do. Your<lb>
mother shows me how lovely it is, and I try to imitate<lb>
it; but this restless soul of mine will ask questions and<lb>
doubt and fear, and worry me in many ways. What<lb>
shall I do to keep it still?&rdquo; asked Christie, smiling, yet<lb>
earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it alone: you cannot force these things, and<lb>
the best way is to wait till the attraction is strong<lb>
enough to keep the needle steady. Some people get<lb>
their ballast slowly, some don't need much, and some<lb>
have to work hard for theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; asked Christie; for David's voice fell a<lb>
little, as he uttered the last words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not got much yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you have. Why, David, you are always<lb>
cheerful and contented, good and generous. If that<lb>
is not true piety, what is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very much deceived, and I am sorry for<lb>
it,&rdquo; said David, with the impatient gesture of the head,<lb>
and a troubled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove it!&rdquo; And Christie looked at him with such<lb>
sincere respect and regard, that his honest nature<lb>
would not let him accept it, though it gratified him<lb>
much.</p>
<p>He made no answer for a minute. Then he said<lb>
slowly, as if feeling a modest man's hesitation to speak<lb>
of himself, yet urged to it by some irresistible impulse:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> prove it if you won't mind the unavoidable<lb>
egotism; for I cannot let you think me so much better<lb>
than I am. Outwardly I seem to you `cheerful, contented,<lb>
generous, and good.' In reality I am sad,<lb>
<pb n="277">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-288">

<figdesc>Page 277.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
dissatisfied, bad, and selfish: see if I 'm not. I often tire<lb>
of this quiet life, hate my work, and long to break<lb>
away, and follow my own wild and wilful impulses, no<lb>
matter where they lead. Nothing keeps me at such<lb>
times but my mother and God's patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David began quietly; but the latter part of this confession<lb>
was made with a sudden impetuosity that startled<lb>
Christie, so utterly unlike his usual self-control was it.<lb>
She could only look at him with the surprise she felt.<lb>
His face was in the shadow; but she saw that it was<lb>
flushed, his eyes excited, and in his voice she heard an<lb>
undertone that made it sternly self-accusing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a hypocrite,&rdquo; he went on rapidly, as if<lb>
driven to speak in spite of himself. &ldquo;I try to be what I<lb>
seem, but it is too hard sometimes and I despair. Especially<lb>
hard is it to feel that I have learned to feign<lb>
happiness so well that others are entirely deceived. Mr.<lb>
Power and mother know me as I am: other friends I<lb>
have not, unless you will let me call you one. Whether<lb>
you do or not after this, I respect you too much to let<lb>
you delude yourself about my virtues, so I tell you the<lb>
truth and abide the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at her as he paused, with a curious<lb>
mixture of pride and humility in his face, and squared<lb>
his broad shoulders as if he had thrown off a burden<lb>
that had much oppressed him.</p>
<p>Christie offered him her hand, saying in a tone that<lb>
did his heart good: &ldquo;The consequences are that I<lb>
respect, admire, and trust you more than ever, and feel<lb>
proud to be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David gave the hand a strong and grateful pressure,<lb>
said, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; in a moved tone, and then leaned<lb>
<pb n="278">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-289">

<figdesc>Page 278.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
back into the shadow, as if trying to recover from this<lb>
unusual burst of confidence, won from him by the soft<lb>
magic of time, place, and companionship.</p>
<p>Fearing he would regret the glimpse he had given<lb>
her, and anxious to show how much she liked it, Christie<lb>
talked on to give him time to regain composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought in reading the lives of saints or<lb>
good men of any time that their struggles were the<lb>
most interesting and helpful things recorded. Human<lb>
imperfection only seems to make real piety more possible,<lb>
and to me more beautiful; for where others have<lb>
conquered I can conquer, having suffered as they suffer,<lb>
and seen their hard-won success. That is the sort of<lb>
religion I want; something to hold by, live in, and<lb>
enjoy, if I can only get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will.&rdquo; He said it heartily, and seemed<lb>
quite calm again; so Christie obeyed the instinct which<lb>
told her that questions would be good for David, and<lb>
that he was in the mood for answering them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask you something,&rdquo; she began a little timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any thing, Christie,&rdquo; he answered instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a rash promise: I am a woman, and therefore<lb>
curious; what shall you do if I take advantage of<lb>
the privilege?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be discreet, and only ask one thing,&rdquo; she<lb>
replied, charmed with her success. &ldquo;You said just now<lb>
that you had learned to feign happiness. I wish you<lb>
would tell me how you do it, for it is such an excellent<lb>
imitation I shall be quite content with it till I can learn<lb>
the genuine thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David fingered the troublesome forelock<lb>
<pb n="279">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-290">

<figdesc>Page 279.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
thoughtfully for a moment, then said, with something of the<lb>
former impetuosity coming back into his voice and<lb>
manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you all about it; that 's the best way: I<lb>
know I shall some day because I can't help it; so I may<lb>
as well have done with it now, since I have begun. It<lb>
is not interesting, mind you, &mdash; only a grim little history<lb>
of one man's fight with the world, the flesh, and the<lb>
devil: will you have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; answered Christie, so eagerly that David<lb>
laughed, in spite of the bitter memories stirring at his<lb>
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So like a woman, always ready to hear and forgive<lb>
sinners,&rdquo; he said, then took a long breath, and added<lb>
rapidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll put it in as few words as possible and much<lb>
good may it do you. Some years ago I was desperately<lb>
miserable; never mind why: I dare say I shall tell you<lb>
all about it some day if I go on at this rate. Well,<lb>
being miserable, as I say, every thing looked black and<lb>
bad to me: I hated all men, distrusted all women,<lb>
doubted the existence of God, and was a forlorn wretch<lb>
generally. Why I did not go to the devil I can't say:<lb>
I did start once or twice; but the thought of that dear<lb>
old woman in there sitting all alone and waiting for me<lb>
dragged me back, and kept me here till the first recklessness<lb>
was over. People talk about duty being sweet;<lb>
I have not found it so, but there it was: I should have<lb>
been a brute to shirk it; so I took it up, and held on<lb>
desperately till it grew bearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <hi rend="italics">has</hi> grown sweet now, David, I am sure,&rdquo; said<lb>
Christie, very low.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; he answered with the stern honesty<lb>
that would not let him deceive himself or others, cost<lb>
what it might to be true. &ldquo;There is a certain solid satisfaction<lb>
in it that I did not use to find. It is not a<lb>
mere dogged persistence now, as it once was, and that<lb>
is a step towards loving it perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke half to himself, and sat leaning his head<lb>
on both hands propped on his knees, looking down as<lb>
if the weight of the old trouble bent his shoulders<lb>
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more, David?&rdquo; said Christie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this. When I found I had got to live, and<lb>
live manfully, I said to myself, `I must have help or I<lb>
cannot do it.' To no living soul could I tell my grief,<lb>
not even to my mother, for she had her own to bear:<lb>
no human being could help me, yet I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have help<lb>
or give up shamefully. Then I did what others do<lb>
when all else fails to sustain them; I turned to God:<lb>
not humbly, not devoutly or trustfully, but doubtfully,<lb>
bitterly, and rebelliously; for I said in my despairing<lb>
heart, `If there <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a God, let Him help me, and I will<lb>
believe.' He did help me, and I kept my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, David, how?&rdquo; whispered Christie after a moment's<lb>
silence, for the last words were solemn in their<lb>
earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The help did not come at once. No miracle answered<lb>
me, and I thought my cry had not been heard. But it<lb>
had, and slowly something like submission came to me.<lb>
It was not cheerful nor pious: it was only a dumb, sad<lb>
sort of patience without hope or faith. It was better<lb>
than desperation; so I accepted it, and bore the inevitable<lb>
as well as I could. Presently, courage seemed to<lb>
<pb n="281">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-292">

<figdesc>Page 281.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
spring up again: I was ashamed to be beaten in the first<lb>
battle, and some sort of blind instinct made me long to<lb>
break away from the past and begin again. My father<lb>
was dead; mother left all to me, and followed where I<lb>
led. I sold the old place, bought this, and, shutting<lb>
out the world as much as I could, I fell to work<lb>
as if my life depended on it. That was five or six<lb>
years ago: and for a long time I delved away without<lb>
interest or pleasure, merely as a safety-valve for my<lb>
energies, and a means of living; for I gave up all my<lb>
earlier hopes and plans when the trouble came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not love my work; but it was good for me,<lb>
and helped cure my sick soul. I never guessed why I felt<lb>
better, but dug on with indifference first, then felt pride<lb>
in my garden, then interest in the plants I tended, and<lb>
by and by I saw what they had done for me, and loved<lb>
them like true friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A broad woodbine leaf had been fluttering against<lb>
David's head, as he leaned on the slender pillar of the<lb>
porch where it grew. Now, as if involuntarily, he laid<lb>
his cheek against it with a caressing gesture, and sat<lb>
looking over the garden lying dewy and still in the<lb>
moonlight, with the grateful look of a man who has<lb>
learned the healing miracles of Nature and how near<lb>
she is to God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power helped you: didn't he?&rdquo; said Christie,<lb>
longing to hear more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much! I never can tell you what he was to me,<lb>
nor how I thank him. To him, and to my work I owe<lb>
the little I have won in the way of strength and comfort<lb>
after years of effort. I see now the compensation<lb>
that comes out of trouble, the lovely possibilities that<lb>
<pb n="282">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-293">

<figdesc>Page 282.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
exist for all of us, and the infinite patience of God,<lb>
which is to me one of the greatest of His divine attributes.<lb>
I have only got so far, but things grow easier as<lb>
one goes on; and if I keep tugging I may yet <hi rend="italics">be</hi> the<lb>
cheerful, contented man I seem. That is all, Christie,<lb>
and a longer story than I meant to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long enough: some time you will tell me more<lb>
perhaps, since you have once begun. It seems quite<lb>
natural now, and I am so pleased and honored by your<lb>
confidence. But I cannot help wondering what made<lb>
you do it all at once,&rdquo; said Christie presently, after they<lb>
had listened to a whippoorwill, and watched the flight<lb>
of a downy owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think I quite know myself, unless it was<lb>
because I have been on my good behavior since you<lb>
came, and, being a humbug, as I tell you, was forced<lb>
to unmask in spite of myself. There are limits to<lb>
human endurance, and the proudest man longs to<lb>
unpack his woes before a sympathizing friend now<lb>
and then. I have been longing to do this for some<lb>
time; but I never like to disturb mother's peace, or<lb>
take Mr. Power from those who need him more. So<lb>
to-day, when you so sweetly offered to help me if<lb>
you could, it quite went to my heart, and seemed so<lb>
friendly and comfortable, I could not resist trying it to-night,<lb>
when you began about my imaginary virtues.<lb>
That is the truth, I believe: now, what shall we do<lb>
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just go on, and do it again whenever you feel like<lb>
it. I know what loneliness is, and how telling worries<lb>
often cures them. I meant every word I said this<lb>
morning, and will prove it by doing any thing in the<lb>
<pb n="283">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-294">

<figdesc>Page 283.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
world I can for you. Believe this, and let me be your<lb>
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had risen, as a stir within told them the guest<lb>
was going; and as Christie spoke she was looking up<lb>
with the moonlight full upon her face.</p>
<p>If there had been any hidden purpose in her mind,<lb>
any false sentiment, or trace of coquetry in her manner,<lb>
it would have spoiled that hearty little speech of hers.</p>
<p>But in her heart was nothing but a sincere desire to<lb>
prove gratitude and offer sympathy; in her manner<lb>
the gentle frankness of a woman speaking to a brother;<lb>
and in her face the earnestness of one who felt the<lb>
value of friendship, and did not ask or give it lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; was David's emphatic answer, and then, as<lb>
if to seal the bargain, he stooped down, and gravely<lb>
kissed her on the forehead.</p>
<p>Christie was a little startled, but neither offended nor<lb>
confused; for there was no love in that quiet kiss, &mdash; only<lb>
respect, affection, and much gratitude; an involuntary<lb>
demonstration from the lonely man to the true-hearted<lb>
woman who had dared to come and comfort him.</p>
<p>Out trotted neighbor Miller, and that was the end of<lb>
confidences in the porch; but David played melodiously<lb>
on his flute that night, and Christie fell asleep saying<lb>
happily to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are all right, friends for ever, and every<lb>
thing will go beautifully.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>EVERY thing <hi rend="italics">did</hi> &ldquo;go beautifully&rdquo; for a time;<lb>
so much so, that Christie began to think she<lb>
really <hi rend="italics">had</hi> &ldquo;got religion.&rdquo; A delightful peace pervaded<lb>
her soul, a new interest made the dullest task agreeable,<lb>
and life grew so inexpressibly sweet that she felt as<lb>
if she could forgive all her enemies, love her friends<lb>
more than ever, and do any thing great, good, or<lb>
glorious.</p>
<p>She had known such moods before, but they had<lb>
never lasted long, and were not so intense as this;<lb>
therefore, she was sure some blessed power had come<lb>
to uphold and cheer her. She sang like a lark as she<lb>
<pb n="285">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-296">

<figdesc>Page 285.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
swept and dusted; thought high and happy thoughts<lb>
among the pots and kettles, and, when she sat sewing,<lb>
smiled unconsciously as if some deep satisfaction made<lb>
sunshine from within. Heart and soul seemed to wake<lb>
up and rejoice as naturally and beautifully as flowers in<lb>
the spring. A soft brightness shone in her eyes, a<lb>
fuller tone sounded in her voice, and her face grew<lb>
young and blooming with the happiness that transfigures<lb>
all it touches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie 's growing handsome,&rdquo; David would say<lb>
to his mother, as if she was a flower in which he took<lb>
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee is a good gardener, Davy,&rdquo; the old lady would<lb>
reply, and when he was busy would watch him with a<lb>
tender sort of anxiety, as if to discover a like change in<lb>
him.</p>
<p>But no alteration appeared, except more cheerfulness<lb>
and less silence; for now there was no need to hide his<lb>
real self, and all the social virtues in him came out<lb>
delightfully after their long solitude.</p>
<p>In her present uplifted state, Christie could no more<lb>
help regarding David as a martyr and admiring him<lb>
for it, than she could help mixing sentiment with her<lb>
sympathy. By the light of the late confessions, his life<lb>
and character looked very different to her now. His<lb>
apparent contentment was resignation; his cheerfulness,<lb>
a manly contempt for complaint; his reserve, the<lb>
modest reticence of one who, having done a hard duty<lb>
well, desires no praise for it. Like all enthusiastic persons,<lb>
Christie had a hearty admiration for self-sacrifice<lb>
and self-control; and, while she learned to see David's<lb>
virtues, she also exaggerated them, and could not do<lb>
<pb n="286">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-297">

<figdesc>Page 286.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
enough to show the daily increasing esteem and respect<lb>
she felt for him, and to atone for the injustice she once<lb>
did him.</p>
<p>She grubbed in the garden and green-house, and<lb>
learned hard botanical names that she might be able to<lb>
talk intelligently upon subjects that interested her comrade.<lb>
Then, as autumn ended out-of-door work, she<lb>
tried to make home more comfortable and attractive<lb>
than ever.</p>
<p>David's room was her especial care; for now to her<lb>
there was something pathetic in the place and its poor<lb>
furnishing. He had fought many a silent battle there;<lb>
won many a secret victory; and tried to cheer his solitude<lb>
with the best thoughts the minds of the bravest,<lb>
wisest men could give him.</p>
<p>She did not smile at the dilapidated idols now, but<lb>
touched them tenderly, and let no dust obscure their<lb>
well-beloved faces. She set the books in order daily,<lb>
taking many a sip of refreshment from them by the<lb>
way, and respectfully regarded those in unknown<lb>
tongues, full of admiration for David's learning. She<lb>
covered the irruptive sofa neatly; saw that the little<lb>
vase was always clear and freshly filled; cared for the<lb>
nursery in the gable-window; and preserved an exquisite<lb>
neatness everywhere, which delighted the soul of the<lb>
room's order-loving occupant.</p>
<p>She also &mdash; alas, for romance! &mdash; cooked the dishes<lb>
David loved, and liked to see him enjoy them with the<lb>
appetite which once had shocked her so. She watched<lb>
over his buttons with a vigilance that would have<lb>
softened the heart of the crustiest bachelor: she even<lb>
gave herself the complexion of a lemon by wearing<lb>
<pb n="287">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-298">

<figdesc>Page 287.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
blue, because David liked the pretty contrast with his<lb>
mother's drabs.</p>
<p>After recording that last fact, it is unnecessary to explain<lb>
what was the matter with Christie. She honestly<lb>
thought she had got religion; but it was piety's twin-sister,<lb>
who produced this wonderful revival in her soul;<lb>
and though she began in all good faith she presently<lb>
discovered that she was</p>
<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;Not the first maiden</l>
<l>Who came but for friendship,</l>
<l>And took away love.&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
<p>After the birthnight confessions, David found it<lb>
easier to go on with the humdrum life he had chosen<lb>
from a sense of duty; for now he felt as if he had not<lb>
only a fellow-worker, but a comrade and friend who understood,<lb>
sympathized with, and encouraged him by an<lb>
interest and good-will inexpressibly comfortable and<lb>
inspiring. Nothing disturbed the charm of the new<lb>
league in those early days; for Christie was thoroughly<lb>
simple and sincere, and did her womanly work with no<lb>
thought of reward or love or admiration.</p>
<p>David saw this, and felt it more attractive than any<lb>
gift of beauty or fascination of manner would have<lb>
been. He had no desire to be a lover, having forbidden<lb>
himself that hope; but he found it so easy and pleasant<lb>
to be a friend that he reproached himself for not trying<lb>
it before; and explained his neglect by the fact that<lb>
Christie was not an ordinary woman, since none of all<lb>
the many he had known and helped, had ever been<lb>
any thing to him but objects of pity and protection.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sterling saw these changes with her wise,<lb>
<pb n="288">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-299">

<figdesc>Page 288.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
motherly eyes, but said nothing; for she influenced<lb>
others by the silent power of character. Speaking<lb>
little, and unusually gifted with the meditative habits<lb>
of age, she seemed to live in a more peaceful world<lb>
than this. As George MacDonald somewhere says,<lb>
&ldquo;Her soul seemed to sit apart in a sunny little room,<lb>
safe from dust and noise, serenely regarding passers-by<lb>
through the clear muslin curtains of her window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, she was neither cold nor careless, stern nor selfish,<lb>
but ready to share all the joys and sorrows of<lb>
those about her; and when advice was asked she gave<lb>
it gladly. Christie had won her heart long ago, and<lb>
now was as devoted as a daughter to her; lightening<lb>
her cares so skilfully that many of them slipped naturally<lb>
on to the young shoulders, and left the old lady<lb>
much time for rest, or the lighter tasks fitted for feeble<lb>
hands. Christie often called her &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; and felt<lb>
herself rewarded for the hardest, humblest job she ever<lb>
did when the sweet old voice said gratefully, &ldquo;I thank<lb>
thee, daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things were in this prosperous, not to say paradisiacal,<lb>
state, when one member of the family began to<lb>
make discoveries of an alarming nature. The first was<lb>
that the Sunday pilgrimages to church were seasons of<lb>
great refreshment to soul and body when David went<lb>
also, and utter failures if he did not. Next, that the<lb>
restless ambitions of all sorts were quite gone; for now<lb>
Christie's mission seemed to be sitting in a quiet corner<lb>
and making shirts in the most exquisite manner, while<lb>
thinking about &mdash; well, say botany, or any kindred subject.<lb>
Thirdly, that home was woman's sphere after all,<lb>
and the perfect roasting of beef, brewing of tea, and<lb>
<pb n="289">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-300">

<figdesc>Page 289.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="13 S">
concocting of delectable puddings, an end worth living<lb>
for if masculine commendation rewarded the labor.</p>
<p>Fourthly, and worst of all, she discovered that she<lb>
was not satisfied with half confidences, and quite pined<lb>
to know all about &ldquo;David's trouble.&rdquo; The little needle-book<lb>
with the faded &ldquo;Letty&rdquo; on it haunted her; and<lb>
when, after a pleasant evening below, she heard him<lb>
pace his room for hours, or play melancholy airs upon<lb>
the flute, she was jealous of that unknown woman who<lb>
had such power to disturb his peace, and felt a strong<lb>
desire to smash the musical confidante into whose responsive<lb>
breast he poured his woe.</p>
<p>At this point Christie paused; and, after evading any<lb>
explanation of these phenomena in the most skilful<lb>
manner for a time, suddenly faced the fact, saying to<lb>
herself with great candor and decision:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what all this means: I 'm beginning to<lb>
like David more than is good for me. I see this clearly,<lb>
and won't dodge any longer, but put a stop to it at<lb>
once. Of course I can if I choose, and now is the time<lb>
to do it; for I understand myself perfectly, and if I<lb>
reach a certain point it is all over with me. That<lb>
point I will <hi rend="italics">not</hi> reach: David's heart is in that Letty's<lb>
grave, and he only cares for me as a friend. I promised<lb>
to be one to him, and I 'll keep my word like an honest<lb>
woman. It may not be easy; but all the sacrifices<lb>
shall not be his, and I won't be a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With praiseworthy resolution Christie set about the<lb>
reformation without delay; not an easy task and one<lb>
that taxed all her wit and wisdom to execute without<lb>
betraying the motive for it. She decided that Mrs.<lb>
Sterling must not be left alone on Sunday, so the young<lb>
<pb n="290">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-301">

<figdesc>Page 290.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
people took turns to go to church, and such dismal trips<lb>
Christie had never known; for all her Sundays were bad<lb>
weather, and Mr. Power seemed to hit on unusually<lb>
uninteresting texts.</p>
<p>She talked while she sewed instead of indulging in<lb>
dangerous thoughts, and Mrs. Sterling was surprised<lb>
and entertained by this new loquacity. In the evening<lb>
she read and studied with a diligence that amazed and<lb>
rather disgusted David; since she kept all her lively<lb>
chat for his mother, and pored over her books when he<lb>
wanted her for other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm trying to brighten up my wits,&rdquo; she said, and<lb>
went on trying to stifle her affections.</p>
<p>But though &ldquo;the absurdity,&rdquo; as she called the new<lb>
revelation, was stopped externally, it continued with<lb>
redoubled vigor internally. Each night she said, &ldquo;this<lb>
<hi rend="italics">must</hi> be conquered,&rdquo; yet each morning it rose fair and<lb>
strong to make the light and beauty of her day, and<lb>
conquer her again. She did her best and bravest, but<lb>
was forced at last to own that she could not &ldquo;put a<lb>
stop to it,&rdquo; because she had already reached the point<lb>
where &ldquo;it was all over with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this critical moment an event occurred which<lb>
completed Christie's defeat, and made her feel that her<lb>
only safety lay in flight.</p>
<p>One evening she sat studying ferns, and heroically<lb>
saying over and over, &ldquo;Andiantum, Aspidium, and<lb>
Asplenium, Trichomanes,&rdquo; while longing to go and talk<lb>
delightfully to David, who sat musing by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't go on so much longer,&rdquo; she thought despairingly.<lb>
&ldquo;Polypodium aureum, a native of Florida,&rdquo; is<lb>
all very interesting in its place; but it doesn't help me<lb>
<pb n="291">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-302">

<figdesc>Page 291.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to gain self-control a bit, and I shall disgrace myself<lb>
if something doesn't happen very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something did happen almost instantly; for as she<lb>
shut the cover sharply on the poor Polypods, a knock<lb>
was heard, and before David could answer it the door<lb>
flew open and a girl ran in. Straight to him she went,<lb>
and clinging to his arm said excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do take care of me: I 've run away again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Kitty, what 's the matter now?&rdquo; asked<lb>
David, putting back her hood, and looking down at her<lb>
with the paternal expression Christie had not seen for<lb>
a long time, and missed very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father found me, and took me home, and wanted<lb>
me to marry a dreadful man, and I wouldn't, so I ran<lb>
away to you. He didn't know I came here before, and<lb>
I 'm safe if you 'll let me stay,&rdquo; cried Kitty, still clinging<lb>
and imploring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will, and glad to see you back again,&rdquo;<lb>
answered David, adding pitifully, as he put her in his<lb>
easy-chair, took her cloak and hood off and stood stroking<lb>
her curly hair: &ldquo;Poor little girl! it is hard to have<lb>
to run away so much: isn 't it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I come here; it 's so pleasant I 'd like to stay<lb>
all my life,&rdquo; and Kitty took a long breath, as if her<lb>
troubles were over now. &ldquo;Who 's that?&rdquo; she asked<lb>
suddenly, as her eye fell on Christie, who sat watching<lb>
her with interest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is our good friend Miss Devon. She came<lb>
to take your place, and we got so fond of her we<lb>
could not let her go,&rdquo; answered David with a gesture<lb>
of introduction, quite unconscious that his position<lb>
just then was about as safe and pleasant as that of<lb>
<pb n="292">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-303">

<figdesc>Page 292.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
a man between a lighted candle and an open powder<lb>
barrel.</p>
<p>The two young women nodded to each other, took<lb>
a swift survey, and made up their minds before David<lb>
had poked the fire. Christie saw a pretty face with<lb>
rosy cheeks, blue eyes, and brown rings of hair lying<lb>
on the smooth, low forehead; a young face, but not<lb>
childlike, for it was conscious of its own prettiness, and<lb>
betrayed the fact by little airs and graces that reminded<lb>
one of a coquettish kitten. Short and slender, she<lb>
looked more youthful than she was; while a gay dress,<lb>
with gilt ear-rings, locket at the throat, and a cherry<lb>
ribbon in her hair made her a bright little figure in that<lb>
plain room.</p>
<p>Christie suddenly felt as if ten years had been added<lb>
to her age, as she eyed the new-comer, who leaned back<lb>
in the great chair talking to David, who stood on the<lb>
rug, evidently finding it pleasanter to look at the vivacious<lb>
face before him than at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the pretty, lively sort of girl sensible men<lb>
often marry, and then discover how silly they are,&rdquo;<lb>
thought Christie, taking up her work and assuming an<lb>
indifferent air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She 's a lady and nice looking, but I know I shan't<lb>
like her,&rdquo; was Kitty's decision, as she turned away and<lb>
devoted herself to David, hoping he would perceive<lb>
how much she had improved and admire her accordingly.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you don't want to marry this Miles because he<lb>
is not handsome. You 'd better think again before you<lb>
make up your mind. He is respectable, well off, and<lb>
fond of you, it seems. Why not try it, Kitty? You<lb>
<pb n="293">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-304">

<figdesc>Page 293.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
need some one to take care of you sadly,&rdquo; David said,<lb>
when her story had been told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If father plagues me much I may take the man;<lb>
but I 'd rather have the other one if he wasn't poor,&rdquo;<lb>
answered Kitty with a side-long glance of the blue<lb>
eyes, and a conscious smile on the red lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there 's another lover, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed and looked at Christie as if inviting<lb>
her to be amused with the freaks and prattle of a child.<lb>
But Christie sewed away without a sign of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won't do, Kitty: you are too young for much<lb>
of such nonsense. I shall keep you here a while, and<lb>
see if we can't settle matters both wisely and pleasantly,&rdquo;<lb>
he said, shaking his head as sagely as a grandfather.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm sure I wish you would: I love to stay here,<lb>
you are always so good to me. I 'm in no hurry to be<lb>
married; and you won't make me: will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty rose as she spoke, and stood before him with a<lb>
beseeching little gesture, and a confiding air quite captivating<lb>
to behold.</p>
<p>Christie was suddenly seized with a strong desire to<lb>
shake the girl and call her an &ldquo;artful little hussy,&rdquo; but<lb>
crushed this unaccountable impulse, and hemmed a<lb>
pocket-handkerchief with reckless rapidity, while she<lb>
stole covert glances at the <hi rend="italics">tableau</hi> by the fire.</p>
<p>David put his finger under Kitty's round chin, and<lb>
lifting her face looked into it, trying to discover if<lb>
she really cared for this suitor who seemed so providentially<lb>
provided for her. Kitty smiled and blushed,<lb>
and dimpled under that grave look so prettily that it<lb>
<pb n="294">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-305">

<figdesc>Page 294.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
soon changed, and David let her go, saying indulgently:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not be troubled, for you are only a child<lb>
after all. Let the lovers go, and stay and play with me,<lb>
for I 've been rather lonely lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's a reproach for me,&rdquo; thought Christie, longing<lb>
to cry out: &ldquo;No, no; send the girl away and let<lb>
<hi rend="italics">me</hi> be all in all to you.&rdquo; But she only turned up the<lb>
lamp and pretended to be looking for a spool, while her<lb>
heart ached and her eyes were too dim for seeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm too old to play, but I 'll stay and tease you as<lb>
I used to, if Miles don't come and carry me off as he<lb>
said he would,&rdquo; answered Kitty, with a toss of the<lb>
head which showed she was not so childlike as David<lb>
fancied. But the next minute she was sitting on a<lb>
stool at his feet petting the cat, while she told her adventures<lb>
with girlish volubility.</p>
<p>Christie could not bear to sit and look on any longer,<lb>
so she left the room, saying she would see if Mrs. Sterling<lb>
wanted any thing, for the old lady kept her room<lb>
with a touch of rheumatism. As she shut the door,<lb>
Christie heard Kitty say softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we 'll be comfortable as we used to be: won't<lb>
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What David answered Christie did not stay to hear,<lb>
but went into the kitchen, and had her first pang of<lb>
jealousy out alone, while she beat up the buckwheats<lb>
for breakfast with an energy that made them miracles<lb>
of lightness on the morrow.</p>
<p>When she told Mrs. Sterling of the new arrival,<lb>
the placid little lady gave a cluck of regret and said<lb>
with unusual emphasis:</p>
<pb n="295">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-306">

<figdesc>Page 295.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Christie, feeling as if she could embrace<lb>
the speaker for the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a giddy little thing, and much care to whoever<lb>
befriends her.&rdquo; Mrs. Sterling would say no more,<lb>
but, as Christie bade her good-night, she held her hand,<lb>
saying with a kiss:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one will take thy place with <hi rend="italics">me,</hi> my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a week Christie suffered constant pin-pricks of<lb>
jealousy, despising herself all the time, and trying to<lb>
be friendly with the disturber of her peace. As if<lb>
prompted by an evil spirit, Kitty unconsciously tried<lb>
and tormented her from morning to night, and no one<lb>
saw or guessed it unless Mrs. Sterling's motherly heart<lb>
divined the truth. David seemed to enjoy the girl's<lb>
lively chat, her openly expressed affection, and the fresh<lb>
young face that always brightened when he came.</p>
<p>Presently, however, Christie saw a change in him,<lb>
and suspected that he had discovered that Kitty was a<lb>
child no longer, but a young girl with her head full of<lb>
love and lovers. The blue eyes grew shy, the pretty<lb>
face grew eloquent with blushes now and then, as he<lb>
looked at it, and the lively tongue faltered sometimes<lb>
in speaking to him. A thousand little coquetries were<lb>
played off for his benefit, and frequent appeals for<lb>
advice in her heart affairs kept tender subjects uppermost<lb>
in their conversations.</p>
<p>At first all this seemed to amuse David as much as<lb>
if Kitty were a small child playing at sweethearts; but<lb>
soon his manner changed, growing respectful, and a<lb>
little cool when Kitty was most confiding. He no<lb>
longer laughed about Miles, stopped calling her &ldquo;little<lb>
<pb n="296">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-307">

<figdesc>Page 296.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
girl,&rdquo; and dropped his paternal ways as he had done<lb>
with Christie. By many indescribable but significant<lb>
signs he showed that he considered Kitty a woman<lb>
now and treated her as such, being all the more scrupulous<lb>
in the respect he paid her, because she was so<lb>
unprotected, and so wanting in the natural dignity and<lb>
refinement which are a woman's best protection.</p>
<p>Christie admired him for this, but saw in it the<lb>
beginning of a tenderer feeling than pity, and felt each<lb>
day that she was one too many now.</p>
<p>Kitty was puzzled and piqued by these changes, and<lb>
being a born flirt tried all her powers on David, veiled<lb>
under guileless girlishness. She was very pretty, very<lb>
charming, and at times most lovable and sweet when<lb>
all that was best in her shallow little heart was touched.<lb>
But it was evident to all that her early acquaintance<lb>
with the hard and sordid side of life had brushed the<lb>
bloom from her nature, and filled her mind with<lb>
thoughts and feelings unfitted to her years.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sterling was very kind to her, but never treated<lb>
her as she did Christie; and though not a word was<lb>
spoken between them the elder women knew that they<lb>
quite agreed in their opinion of Kitty. She evidently<lb>
was rather afraid of the old lady, who said so little and<lb>
saw so much. Christie also she shunned without appearing<lb>
to do so, and when alone with her put on airs<lb>
that half amused, half irritated the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David is my friend, and I don't care for any one<lb>
else,&rdquo; her manner said as plainly as words; and to him<lb>
she devoted herself so entirely, and apparently so successfully,<lb>
that Christie made up her mind he had at<lb>
last begun to forget his Letty, and think of filling the<lb>
void her loss had left.</p>
<pb n="297">

</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="13*">
<p>A few words which she accidentally overheard confirmed<lb>
this idea, and showed her what she must do.<lb>
As she came quietly in one evening from a stroll in the<lb>
lane, and stood taking off cloak and hood, she caught a<lb>
glimpse through the half-open parlor door of David<lb>
pacing to and fro with a curiously excited expression<lb>
on his face, and heard Mrs. Sterling say with unusual<lb>
warmth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee is too hard upon thyself, Davy. Forget the<lb>
past and be happy as other men are. Thee has atoned<lb>
for thy fault long ago, so let me see thee at peace<lb>
before I die, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, mother, not yet. I have no right to hope<lb>
or ask for any woman's love till I am worthier of it,&rdquo;<lb>
answered David in a tone that thrilled Christie's heart:<lb>
it was so full of love and longing.</p>
<p>Here Kitty came running in from the green-house<lb>
with her hands full of flowers, and passing Christie, who<lb>
was fumbling among the cloaks in the passage, she<lb>
went to show David some new blossom.</p>
<p>He had no time to alter the expression of his face<lb>
for its usual grave serenity: Kitty saw the change at<lb>
once, and spoke of it with her accustomed want of<lb>
tact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How handsome you look! What <hi rend="italics">are</hi> you thinking<lb>
about?&rdquo; she said, gazing up at him with her own eyes<lb>
bright with wonder, and her cheeks glowing with the<lb>
delicate carmine of the frosty air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking that you look more like a rose than<lb>
ever,&rdquo; answered David turning her attention from himself<lb>
by a compliment, and beginning to admire the<lb>
<pb n="298">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-309">

<figdesc>Page 298.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
flowers, still with that flushed and kindled look on his<lb>
own face.</p>
<p>Christie crept upstairs, and, sitting in the dark, decided<lb>
with the firmness of despair to go away, lest she should<lb>
betray the secret that possessed her, a dead hope now,<lb>
but still too dear to be concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power told me to come to him when I got tired<lb>
of this. I 'll say I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> tired and try something else, no<lb>
matter what: I can bear any thing, but to stand quietly<lb>
by and see David marry that empty-hearted girl, who<lb>
dares to show that she desires to win him. Out of<lb>
sight of all this, I can conquer my love, at least hide it;<lb>
but if I stay I know I shall betray myself in some bitter<lb>
minute, and I 'd rather die than do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed with this resolution, Christie went the next<lb>
day to Mr. Power, and simply said: &ldquo;I am not needed<lb>
at the Sterlings any more: can you give me other work<lb>
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Power's keen eye searched her face for a moment,<lb>
as if to discover the real motive for her wish.<lb>
But Christie had nerved herself to bear that look, and<lb>
showed no sign of her real trouble, unless the set expression<lb>
of her lips, and the unnatural steadiness of<lb>
her eyes betrayed it to that experienced reader of<lb>
human hearts.</p>
<p>Whatever he suspected or saw, Mr. Power kept to<lb>
himself, and answered in his cordial way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I 've been expecting you would tire of that<lb>
quiet life, and have plenty of work ready for you.<lb>
One of my good Dorcases is tired out and must rest; so<lb>
you shall take her place and visit my poor, report<lb>
their needs, and supply them as fast as we can. Does<lb>
that suit you?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="299">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-310">

<figdesc>Page 299.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely, sir. Where shall I live?&rdquo; asked Christie,<lb>
with an expression of relief that said much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here for the present. I want a secretary to put my<lb>
papers in order, write some of my letters, and do a<lb>
thousand things to help a busy man. My old housekeeper<lb>
likes you, and will let you take a duster now<lb>
and then if you don't find enough other work to do.<lb>
When can you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie answered with a long breath of satisfaction:<lb>
&ldquo;To-morrow, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do: can you be spared so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! they don't want me now at all, or I would<lb>
not leave them. Kitty can take my place: she needs<lb>
protection more than I; and there is not room for two.&rdquo;<lb>
She checked herself there, conscious that a tone of<lb>
bitterness had crept into her voice. Then quite steadily<lb>
she added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be kind enough to write, and ask Mrs.<lb>
Sterling if she can spare me? I shall find it hard to<lb>
tell her myself, for I fear she may think me ungrateful<lb>
after all her kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: she is used to parting with those whom she<lb>
has helped, and is always glad to set them on their way<lb>
toward better things. I will write to-morrow, and you<lb>
can come whenever you will, sure of a welcome, my<lb>
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the tone of those last words, and the<lb>
pressure of the strong, kind hand, touched Christie's<lb>
sore heart, and made it impossible for her to hide the<lb>
truth entirely.</p>
<p>She only said: &ldquo;Thank you, sir. I shall be very<lb>
glad to come;&rdquo; but her eyes were full, and she held<lb>
<pb n="300">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-311">

<figdesc>Page 300.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
his hand an instant, as if she clung to it sure of succor<lb>
and support.</p>
<p>Then she went home so pale and quiet; so helpful,<lb>
patient, and affectionate, that Mrs. Sterling watched<lb>
her anxiously; David looked amazed; and, even selfabsorbed<lb>
Kitty saw the change, and was touched<lb>
by it.</p>
<p>On the morrow, Mr. Power's note came, and Christie<lb>
fled upstairs while it was read and discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I get through this parting without disgracing<lb>
myself, I don't care what happens to me afterward,&rdquo; she<lb>
said; and, in order that she might do so, she assumed<lb>
a cheerful air, and determined to depart with all the<lb>
honors of war, if she died in the attempt.</p>
<p>So, when Mrs. Sterling called her down, she went<lb>
humming into the parlor, smiled as she read the note<lb>
silently given her, and then said with an effort greater<lb>
than any she had ever made in her most arduous part<lb>
on the stage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did say to Mr. Power that I thought I 'd<lb>
better be moving on. I 'm a restless creature as you<lb>
know; and, now that you don't need me, I 've a fancy to<lb>
see more of the world. If you want me back again in<lb>
the spring, I 'll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">shall</hi> want thee, my dear, but will not say a word<lb>
to keep thee now, for thee does need a change, and Mr.<lb>
Power can give thee work better suited to thy taste<lb>
than any here. We shall see thee sometimes, and<lb>
spring will make thee long for the flowers, I hope,&rdquo;<lb>
was Mrs. Sterling's answer, as Christie gave back the<lb>
note at the end of her difficult speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't think me ungrateful. I have been very<lb>
<pb n="301">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-312">

<figdesc>Page 301.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
happy here, and never shall forget how motherly kind<lb>
you have been to me. You will believe this and love<lb>
me still, though I go away and leave you for a little<lb>
while?&rdquo; prayed Christie, with a face full of treacherous<lb>
emotion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sterling laid her hand on Christie's head, as she<lb>
knelt down impulsively before her, and with a soft solemnity<lb>
that made the words both an assurance and a<lb>
blessing, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe and love and honor thee, my child. My<lb>
heart warmed to thee from the first: it has taken<lb>
thee to itself now; and nothing can ever come between<lb>
us, unless thee wills it. Remember that, and go in<lb>
peace with an old friend's thanks, and good wishes<lb>
in return for faithful service, which no money can<lb>
repay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie laid her cheek against that wrinkled one, and,<lb>
for a moment, was held close to that peaceful old heart<lb>
which felt so tenderly for her, yet never wounded her<lb>
by a word of pity. Infinitely comforting was that little<lb>
instant of time, when the venerable woman consoled<lb>
the young one with a touch, and strengthened her by<lb>
the mute eloquence of sympathy.</p>
<p>This made the hardest task of all easier to perform;<lb>
and, when David met her in the evening, Christie was<lb>
ready to play out her part, feeling that Mrs. Sterling<lb>
would help her, if need be. But David took it very<lb>
quietly; at least, he showed no very poignant regret at<lb>
her departure, though he lamented it, and hoped it<lb>
would not be a very long absence. This wounded<lb>
Christie terribly; for all of a sudden a barrier seemed<lb>
to rise between them, and the old friendliness grew<lb>
chilled.</p>
<pb n="302">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-313">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks I am ungrateful, and is offended,&rdquo; she<lb>
said to herself. &ldquo;Well, I can bear coldness better than<lb>
kindness now, and it will make it easier to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty was pleased at the prospect of reigning alone,<lb>
and did not disguise her satisfaction; so Christie's last<lb>
day was any thing but pleasant. Mr. Power would<lb>
send for her on the morrow, and she busied herself in<lb>
packing her own possessions, setting every thing in<lb>
order, and making various little arrangements for Mrs.<lb>
Sterling's comfort, as Kitty was a heedless creature;<lb>
willing enough, but very forgetful. In the evening<lb>
some neighbors came in; so that dangerous time was<lb>
safely passed, and Christie escaped to her own room<lb>
with her usual quiet good-night all round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won't have any sentimental demonstrations;<lb>
no wailing, or tender adieux. If I 'm weak enough to<lb>
break my heart, no one need know it, &mdash; least of all,<lb>
that little fool,&rdquo; thought Christie, grimly, as she burnt<lb>
up several long-cherished relics of her love.</p>
<p>She was up early, and went about her usual work<lb>
with the sad pleasure with which one performs a task<lb>
for the last time. Lazy little Kitty never appeared till<lb>
the bell rang; and Christie was fond of that early hour,<lb>
busy though it was, for David was always before her<lb>
with blazing fires; and, while she got breakfast, he<lb>
came and went with wood and water, milk and marketing;<lb>
often stopping to talk, and always in his happiest<lb>
mood.</p>
<p>The first snow-fall had made the world wonderfully<lb>
lovely that morning; and Christie stood at the window<lb>
admiring the bridal look of the earth, as it lay dazzlingly<lb>
white in the early sunshine. The little parlor<lb>
<pb n="303">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-314">

<figdesc>Page 303.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
was fresh and clean, with no speck of dust anywhere;<lb>
the fire burned on the bright andirons; the flowers<lb>
were rejoicing in their morning bath; and the table<lb>
was set out with dainty care. So homelike, so pleasant,<lb>
so very dear to her, that Christie yearned to stay,<lb>
yet dared not, and had barely time to steady face and<lb>
voice, when David came in with the little posies he<lb>
always had ready for his mother and Christie at breakfast<lb>
time. Only a flower by their plates; but it meant<lb>
much to them: for, in these lives of ours, tender little<lb>
acts do more to bind hearts together than great deeds<lb>
or heroic words; since the first are like the dear daily<lb>
bread that none can live without; the latter but occasional<lb>
feasts, beautiful and memorable, but not possible<lb>
to all.</p>
<p>This morning David laid a sprig of sweet-scented<lb>
balm at his mother's place, two or three rosy daisies at<lb>
Kitty's, and a bunch of Christie's favorite violets at hers.<lb>
She smiled as her eye went from the scentless daisies,<lb>
so pertly pretty, to her own posy full of perfume, and<lb>
the half sad, half sweet associations that haunt these<lb>
blue-eyed flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted pansies for you, but not one would bloom;<lb>
so I did the next best, since you don't like roses,&rdquo; said<lb>
David, as Christie stood looking at the violets with<lb>
a thoughtful face, for something in the peculiarly graceful<lb>
arrangement of the heart-shaped leaves recalled<lb>
another nosegay to her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like these very much, because they came to me in<lb>
the beginning of this, the happiest year of my life;&rdquo;<lb>
and scarcely knowing why, except that it was very sweet<lb>
to talk with David in the early sunshine, she told about<lb>
<pb n="304">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-315">

<figdesc>Page 304.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the flowers some one had given her at church. As she<lb>
finished she looked up at him; and, though his face was<lb>
perfectly grave, his eyes laughed, and with a sudden conviction<lb>
of the truth, Christie exclaimed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, I do believe it was you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn't help it: you seemed so touched and<lb>
troubled. I longed to speak to you, but didn't dare, so<lb>
dropped the flowers and got away as fast as possible.<lb>
Did you think it very rude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it the sweetest thing that ever happened<lb>
to me. That was my first step along a road that you<lb>
have strewn with flowers ever since. I can't thank<lb>
you, but I never shall forget it.&rdquo; Christie spoke out<lb>
fervently, and for an instant her heart shone in her<lb>
face. Then she checked herself, and, fearing she had<lb>
said too much, fell to slicing bread with an energetic<lb>
rapidity which resulted in a cut finger. Dropping the<lb>
knife, she tried to get her handkerchief, but the blood<lb>
flowed fast, and the pain of a deep gash made her a<lb>
little faint. David sprung to help her, tied up the<lb>
wound, put her in the big chair, held water to her lips,<lb>
and bathed her temples with a wet napkin; silently, but<lb>
so tenderly, that it was almost too much for poor<lb>
Christie.</p>
<p>For one happy moment her head lay on his arm, and<lb>
his hand brushed back her hair with a touch that was a<lb>
caress: she heard his heart beat fast with anxiety; felt<lb>
his breath on her cheek, and wished that she might die<lb>
then and there, though a bread-knife was not a romantic<lb>
weapon, nor a cut finger as interesting as a broken<lb>
heart. Kitty's voice made her start up, and the blissful<lb>
vision of life, with David in the little house alone,<lb>

vanished like a bright bubble, leaving the hard reality to<lb>
be lived out with nothing but a woman's pride to<lb>
conceal a woman's most passionate pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's nothing: I 'm all right now. Don't say any<lb>
thing to worry your mother; I 'll put on a bit of courtplaster,<lb>
and no one will be the wiser,&rdquo; she said, hastily<lb>
removing all traces of the accident but her own pale<lb>
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Christie, it 's hard that you should go away<lb>
<pb n="306">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-317">

<figdesc>Page 306.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
with a wound like this on the hand that has done so<lb>
much for us,&rdquo; said David, as he carefully adjusted the<lb>
black strip on that forefinger, roughened by many<lb>
stitches set for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved to do it,&rdquo; was all Christie trusted herself to<lb>
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you did; and in your own words I can only<lb>
answer: `I don't know how to thank you, but I never<lb>
shall forget it.&rdquo;' And David kissed the wounded hand<lb>
as gratefully and reverently as if its palm was not<lb>
hardened by the humblest tasks.</p>
<p>If he had only known &mdash; ah, if he had only known! &mdash;<lb>
how easily he might repay that debt, and heal the<lb>
deeper wound in Christie's heart. As it was, she could<lb>
only say, &ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; and begin to shovel tea<lb>
into the pot, as Kitty came in, as rosy and fresh as the<lb>
daisies she put in her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain't they becoming?&rdquo; she asked, turning to David<lb>
for admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he answered absently, looking out<lb>
over her head, as he stood upon the rug in the attitude<lb>
which the best men <hi rend="italics">will</hi> assume in the bosoms of their<lb>
families.</p>
<p>Kitty looked offended, and turned to the mirror for<lb>
comfort; while Christie went on shovelling tea, quite<lb>
unconscious what she was about till David said gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't that be rather strong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me! I always forget that Kitty does<lb>
not drink tea,&rdquo; and Christie rectified her mistake with<lb>
all speed.</p>
<p>Kitty laughed, and said in her pert little way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting up early don't seem to agree with either<lb>

</eaffig>
of you this morning: I wonder what you've been<lb>
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your work. Suppose you bring in the kettle:<lb>
Christie has hurt her hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David spoke quietly; but Kitty looked as much surprised<lb>
as if he had boxed her ears, for he had never<lb>
used that tone to her before. She meekly obeyed; and<lb>
David added with a smile to Christie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother is coming down, and you 'll have to get<lb>
more color into your cheeks if you mean to hide your<lb>
accident from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easily done;&rdquo; and Christie rubbed her pale<lb>
cheeks till they rivalled Kitty's in their bloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well you women know how to conceal your<lb>
wounds,&rdquo; said David, half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an invaluable accomplishment for us sometimes:<lb>
you forget that I have been an actress,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Christie, with a bitter sort of smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could forget what <hi rend="italics">I</hi> have been!&rdquo; muttered<lb>
David, turning his back to her and kicking a log that<lb>
had rolled out of place.</p>
<p>In came Mrs. Sterling, and every one brightened up<lb>
to meet her. Kitty was silent, and wore an injured air<lb>
which nobody minded; Christie was very lively; and<lb>
David did his best to help her through that last meal,<lb>
which was a hard one to three out of the four.</p>
<p>At noon a carriage came for Christie, and she said<lb>
good-by, as she had drilled herself to say it, cheerfully<lb>
and steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only for a time, else I couldn't let thee go,<lb>
my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sterling, with a close embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see you at church, and Tuesday evenings,<lb>
<pb n="308">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-319">

<figdesc>Page 308.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
even if you don't find time to come to us, so I shall not<lb>
say good-by at all;&rdquo; and David shook hands warmly,<lb>
as he put her into the carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll invite you to my wedding when I make up my<lb>
mind,&rdquo; said Kitty, with feminine malice; for in her eyes<lb>
Christie was an old maid who doubtless envied her her<lb>
&ldquo;lots of lovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will be very happy. In the mean time<lb>
try to save dear Mrs. Sterling all you can, and let her<lb>
make you worthy a good husband,&rdquo; was Christie's answer<lb>
to a speech she was too noble to resent by a sharp<lb>
word, or even a contemptuous look.</p>
<p>Then she drove away, smiling and waving her hand<lb>
to the old lady at her window; but the last thing she<lb>
saw as she left the well-beloved lane, was David going<lb>
slowly up the path, with Kitty close beside him, talking<lb>
busily. If she had heard the short dialogue between<lb>
them, the sight would have been less bitter, for Kitty<lb>
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She 's dreadful good; but I 'm glad she 's gone: ain't<lb>
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you rather have her here than me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don't you ask her to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would if I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did see any thing like it; every one is so<lb>
queer and cross to-day I get snubbed all round. If<lb>
folks ain't good to me, I 'll go and marry Miles! I declare<lb>
I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You 'd better,&rdquo; and with that David left her frowning<lb>
and pouting in the porch, and went to shovelling<lb>
snow with unusual vigor.</p>

<p>MR. POWER received Christie so hospitably that<lb>
she felt at home at once, and took up her new<lb>
duties with the energy of one anxious to repay a favor.<lb>
Her friend knew well the saving power of work, and<lb>
gave her plenty of it; but it was a sort that at once<lb>
interested and absorbed her, so that she had little time<lb>
for dangerous thoughts or vain regrets. As he once<lb>
said, Mr. Power made her own troubles seem light by<lb>
showing her others so terribly real and great that she<lb>
was ashamed to repine at her own lot.</p>
<pb n="310">

</p>
<p>Her gift of sympathy served her well, past experience<lb>
gave her a quick eye to read the truth in others,<lb>
and the earnest desire to help and comfort made her an<lb>
excellent almoner for the rich, a welcome friend to the<lb>
poor. She was in just the right mood to give herself<lb>
gladly to any sort of sacrifice, and labored with a quiet<lb>
energy, painful to witness had any one known the hidden<lb>
suffering that would not let her rest.</p>
<p>If she had been a regular novel heroine at this crisis,<lb>
she would have grown gray in a single night, had a<lb>
dangerous illness, gone mad, or at least taken to pervading<lb>
the house at unseasonable hours with her back<lb>
hair down and much wringing of the hands. Being<lb>
only a commonplace woman she did nothing so romantic,<lb>
but instinctively tried to sustain and comfort herself<lb>
with the humble, wholesome duties and affections<lb>
which seldom fail to keep heads sane and hearts safe.<lb>
Yet, though her days seemed to pass so busily and<lb>
cheerfully, it must be confessed that there were lonely<lb>
vigils in the night; and sometimes in the morning<lb>
Christie's eyes were very heavy, Christie's pillow wet<lb>
with tears.</p>
<p>But life never is all work or sorrow; and happy<lb>
hours, helpful pleasures, are mercifully given like wayside<lb>
springs to pilgrims trudging wearily along. Mr.<lb>
Power showed Christie many such, and silently provided<lb>
her with better consolation than pity or advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deeds not words,&rdquo; was his motto; and he lived it<lb>
out most faithfully. &ldquo;Books and work&rdquo; he gave his<lb>
new charge; and then followed up that prescription<lb>
with &ldquo;healthful play&rdquo; of a sort she liked, and had<lb>
longed for all her life. Sitting at his table Christie<lb>
<pb n="311">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-322">

<figdesc>Page 311.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
saw the best and bravest men and women of our times;<lb>
for Mr. Power was a magnet that drew them from all<lb>
parts of the world. She saw and heard, admired and<lb>
loved them; felt her soul kindle with the desire to follow<lb>
in their steps, share their great tasks, know their<lb>
difficulties and dangers, and in the end taste the immortal<lb>
satisfactions given to those who live and labor for<lb>
their fellow-men. In such society all other aims seemed<lb>
poor and petty; for they appeared to live in a nobler<lb>
world than any she had known, and she felt as if<lb>
they belonged to another race; not men nor angels,<lb>
but a delightful mixture of the two; more as she imagined<lb>
the gods and heroes of old; not perfect, but<lb>
wonderfully strong and brave and good; each gifted<lb>
with a separate virtue, and each bent on a mission that<lb>
should benefit mankind.</p>
<p>Nor was this the only pleasure given her. One evening<lb>
of each week was set apart by Mr. Power for the<lb>
reception of whomsoever chose to visit him; for his<lb>
parish was a large one, and his house a safe haunt for<lb>
refugees from all countries, all oppressions.</p>
<p>Christie enjoyed these evenings heartily, for there<lb>
was no ceremony; each comer brought his mission,<lb>
idea, or need, and genuine hospitality made the visit<lb>
profitable or memorable to all, for entire freedom prevailed,<lb>
and there was stabling for every one's hobby.</p>
<p>Christie felt that she was now receiving the best culture,<lb>
acquiring the polish that society gives, and makes<lb>
truly admirable when character adds warmth and power<lb>
to its charm. The presence of her bosom-care calmed<lb>
the old unrest, softened her manners, and at times<lb>
touched her face with an expression more beautiful<lb>
<pb n="312">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-323">

<figdesc>Page 312.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
than heauty. She was quite unconscious of the changes<lb>
passing over her; and if any one had told her she was<lb>
fast becoming a most attractive woman, she would<lb>
have been utterly incredulous. But others saw and<lb>
felt the new charm; for no deep experience bravely<lb>
borne can fail to leave its mark, often giving power in<lb>
return for patience, and lending a subtle loveliness to<lb>
faces whose bloom it has destroyed.</p>
<p>This fact was made apparent to Christie one evening<lb>
when she went down to the weekly gathering in one<lb>
of the melancholy moods which sometimes oppressed<lb>
her. She felt dissatisfied with herself because her<lb>
interest in all things began to flag, and a restless<lb>
longing for some new excitement to break up the<lb>
monotonous pain of her inner life possessed her. Being<lb>
still a little shy in company, she slipped quietly into a<lb>
recess which commanded a view of both rooms, and<lb>
sat looking listlessly about her while waiting for David,<lb>
who seldom failed to come.</p>
<p>A curious collection of fellow-beings was before her,<lb>
and at another time she would have found much to<lb>
interest and amuse her. In one corner a newly imported<lb>
German with an Orson-like head, thumb-ring,<lb>
and the fragrance of many meerschaums still hovering<lb>
about him, was hammering away upon some disputed<lb>
point with a scientific Frenchman, whose national<lb>
politeness was only equalled by his national volubility.<lb>
A prominent statesman was talking with a fugitive<lb>
slave; a young poet getting inspiration from the face<lb>
and voice of a handsome girl who had earned the right<lb>
to put M. D. to her name. An old philosopher was calming<lb>
the ardor of several rampant radicals, and a famous<lb>

<figdesc>Page 313.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="14">
singer was comforting the heart of an Italian exile by<lb>
talking politics in his own melodious tongue.</p>
<p>There were plenty of reformers: some as truculent<lb>
as Martin Luther; others as beaming and benevolent<lb>
as if the pelting of the world had only mellowed<lb>
them, and no amount of denunciatory thunder could<lb>
sour the milk of human kindness creaming in their<lb>
happy hearts. There were eager women just beginning<lb>
their protest against the wrongs that had wrecked their<lb>
peace; subdued women who had been worsted in the<lb>
unequal conflict and given it up; resolute women with<lb>
&ldquo;No surrender&rdquo; written all over their strong-minded<lb>
countenances; and sweet, hopeful women, whose faith<lb>
in God and man nothing could shake or sadden.</p>
<p>But to Christie there was only one face worth looking<lb>
at till David came, and that was Mr. Power's; for<lb>
he was a perfect host, and pervaded the rooms like a<lb>
genial atmosphere, using the welcome of eye and hand<lb>
which needs no language to interpret it, giving to each<lb>
guest the intellectual fare he loved, and making their<lb>
enjoyment his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the dear man! what should we all do without<lb>
him?&rdquo; thought Christie, following him with grateful<lb>
eyes, as he led an awkward youth in rusty black to the<lb>
statesman whom it had been the desire of his ambitious<lb>
soul to meet.</p>
<p>The next minute she proved that <hi rend="italics">she</hi> at least could<lb>
do without the &ldquo;dear man;&rdquo; for David entered the<lb>
room, and she forgot all about him. Here and at<lb>
church were the only places where the friends had<lb>
met during these months, except one or two short<lb>
<pb n="314">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-325">

<figdesc>Page 314.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
visits to the little house in the lane when Christie<lb>
devoted herself to Mrs. Sterling.</p>
<p>David was quite unchanged, though once or twice<lb>
Christie fancied he seemed ill at ease with her, and immediately<lb>
tormented herself with the idea that some<lb>
alteration in her own manner had perplexed or offended<lb>
him. She did her best to be as frank and cordial as in<lb>
the happy old days; but it was impossible, and she soon<lb>
gave it up, assuming in the place of that former friendliness,<lb>
a grave and quiet manner which would have led<lb>
a wiser man than David to believe her busied with her<lb>
own affairs and rather indifferent to every thing else.</p>
<p>If he had known how her heart danced in her bosom,<lb>
her eyes brightened, and all the world became endurable,<lb>
the moment he appeared, he would not have been<lb>
so long in joining her, nor have doubted what welcome<lb>
awaited him.</p>
<p>As it was, he stopped to speak to his host; and, before<lb>
he reappeared, Christie had found the excitement she<lb>
had been longing for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now some bore will keep him an hour, and the<lb>
evening is <hi rend="italics">so</hi> short,&rdquo; she thought, with a pang of disappointment;<lb>
and, turning her eyes away from the crowd<lb>
which had swallowed up her heart's desire, they fell<lb>
upon a gentleman just entering, and remained fixed<lb>
with an expression of unutterable surprise; for there,<lb>
elegant, calm, and cool as ever, stood Mr. Fletcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came he here?&rdquo; was her first question; &ldquo;How<lb>
will he behave to me?&rdquo; her second. As she could<lb>
answer neither, she composed herself as fast as possible,<lb>
resolving to let matters take their own course, and<lb>
feeling in the mood for an encounter with a discarded<lb>
<pb n="315">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-326">

<figdesc>Page 315.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
lover, as she took a womanish satisfaction in remembering<lb>
that the very personable gentleman before her had<lb>
once been.</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher and his companion passed on to find<lb>
their host; and, with a glance at the mirror opposite,<lb>
which showed her that the surprise of the moment had<lb>
given her the color she lacked before, Christie occupied<lb>
herself with a portfolio of engravings, feeling very<lb>
much as she used to feel when waiting at a side scene<lb>
for her cue.</p>
<p>She had not long to wait before Mr. Power came up,<lb>
and presented the stranger; for such he fancied him,<lb>
never having heard a certain episode in Christie's life.<lb>
Mr. Fletcher bowed, with no sign of recognition in his<lb>
face, and began to talk in the smooth, low voice she<lb>
remembered so well. For the moment, through sheer<lb>
surprise, Christie listened and replied as any young<lb>
lady might have done to a new-made acquaintance.<lb>
But very soon she felt sure that Mr. Fletcher intended<lb>
to ignore the past; and, finding her on a higher round<lb>
of the social ladder, to accept the fact and begin again.</p>
<p>At first she was angry, then amused, then interested<lb>
in the somewhat dramatic turn affairs were taking, and<lb>
very wisely decided to meet him on his own ground,<lb>
and see what came of it.</p>
<p>In the midst of an apparently absorbing discussion<lb>
of one of Raphael's most insipid Madonnas, she was<lb>
conscious that David had approached, paused, and<lb>
was scrutinizing her companion with unusual interest.<lb>
Seized with a sudden desire to see the two men together,<lb>
Christie beckoned; and when he obeyed, she<lb>
introduced him, drew him into the conversation, and<lb>
<pb n="316">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-327">

<figdesc>Page 316.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
then left him in the lurch by falling silent and taking<lb>
notes while they talked.</p>
<p>If she wished to wean her heart from David by seeing<lb>
him at a disadvantage, she could have devised no better<lb>
way; for, though a very feminine test, it answered the<lb>
purpose excellently.</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher was a handsome man, and just then<lb>
looked his best. Improved health gave energy and<lb>
color to his formerly sallow, listless face: the cold eyes<lb>
were softer, the hard mouth suave and smiling, and<lb>
about the whole man there was that indescribable<lb>
something which often proves more attractive than<lb>
worth or wisdom to keener-sighted women than Christie.<lb>
Never had he talked better; for, as if he suspected<lb>
what was in the mind of one hearer, he exerted himself<lb>
to be as brilliant as possible, and succeeded admirably.</p>
<p>David never appeared so ill, for he had no clew to<lb>
the little comedy being played before him; and long<lb>
seclusion and natural reserve unfitted him to shine<lb>
beside a man of the world like Mr. Fletcher. His<lb>
simple English sounded harsh, after the foreign phrases<lb>
that slipped so easily over the other's tongue. He had<lb>
visited no galleries, seen few of the world's wonders,<lb>
and could only listen when they were discussed. More<lb>
than once he was right, but failed to prove it, for Mr.<lb>
Fletcher skilfully changed the subject or quenched him<lb>
with a politely incredulous shrug.</p>
<p>Even in the matter of costume, poor David was<lb>
worsted; for, in a woman's eyes, dress has wonderful<lb>
significance. Christie used to think his suit of sober gray<lb>
the most becoming man could wear; but now it looked<lb>
shapeless and shabby, beside garments which bore the<lb>
<pb n="317">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-328">

<figdesc>Page 317.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stamp of Paris in the gloss and grace of broadcloth<lb>
and fine linen. David wore no gloves: Mr. Fletcher's<lb>
were immaculate. David's tie was so plain no<lb>
one observed it: Mr. Fletcher's, elegant and faultless<lb>
enough for a modern Beau Brummel. David's handkerchief<lb>
was of the commonest sort (she knew that,<lb>
for she hemmed it herself): Mr. Fletcher's was the finest<lb>
cambric, and a delicate breath of perfume refreshed the<lb>
aristocratic nose to which the article belonged.</p>
<p>Christie despised herself as she made these comparisons,<lb>
and felt how superficial they were; but, having<lb>
resolved to exalt one man at the expense of the other for<lb>
her own good, she did not relent till David took advantage<lb>
of a pause, and left them with a reproachful look that<lb>
made her wish Mr. Fletcher at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>When they were alone a subtle change in his face<lb>
and manner convinced her that he also had been taking<lb>
notes, and had arrived at a favorable decision regarding<lb>
herself. Women are quick at making such discoveries;<lb>
and, even while she talked with him as a stranger,<lb>
she felt assured that, if she chose, she might make him<lb>
again her lover.</p>
<p>Here was a temptation! She had longed for some<lb>
new excitement, and fate seemed to have put one of<lb>
the most dangerous within her reach. It was natural<lb>
to find comfort in the knowledge that somebody loved<lb>
her, and to take pride in her power over one man,<lb>
because another did not own it. In spite of her better<lb>
self she felt the fascination of the hour, and yielded to<lb>
it, half unconsciously assuming something of the &ldquo;dash<lb>
and daring&rdquo; which Mr. Fletcher had once confessed to<lb>
finding so captivating in the demure governess. He<lb>
<pb n="318">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-329">

<figdesc>Page 318.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
evidently thought so still, and played his part with<lb>
spirit; for, while apparently enjoying a conversation<lb>
which contained no allusion to the past, the memory of<lb>
it gave piquancy to that long <hi rend="italics">t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</hi></p>
<p>As the first guests began to go, Mr. Fletcher's friend<lb>
beckoned to him; and he rose, saying with an accent of<lb>
regret which changed to one of entreaty, as he put his<lb>
question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, must go. May I come again, Miss Devon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am scarcely more than a guest myself; but Mr.<lb>
Power is always glad to see whoever cares to come,&rdquo;<lb>
replied Christie rather primly, though her eyes were<lb>
dancing with amusement at the recollection of those<lb>
love passages upon the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time, I shall come not as a stranger, but as a<lb>
former &mdash; may I say friend?&rdquo; he added quickly, as if<lb>
emboldened by the mirthful eyes that so belied the<lb>
demure lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you forget your part,&rdquo; and Christie's primness<lb>
vanished in a laugh. &ldquo;I am glad of it, for I want to<lb>
ask about Mrs. Saltonstall and the children. I 've<lb>
often thought of the little dears, and longed to see<lb>
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in Paris with their father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Saltonstall is well, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She died six months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expression of genuine sorrow came over Mr.<lb>
Fletcher's face as he spoke; and, remembering that the<lb>
silly little woman was his sister, Christie put out her<lb>
hand with a look and gesture so full of sympathy that<lb>
words were unnecessary. Taking advantage of this<lb>
propitious moment, he said, with an expressive glance<lb>
<pb n="319">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-330">

<figdesc>Page 319.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and effective tone: &ldquo;I am all alone now. You <hi rend="italics">will</hi> let<lb>
me come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if it can give you pleasure,&rdquo; she answered<lb>
heartily, forgetting herself in pity for his sorrow.<lb>
</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher pressed her hand with a grateful,<lb>
&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; and wisely went away at once, leaving<lb>
compassion to plead for him better than he could have<lb>
done it for himself.</p>
<p>Leaning back in her chair, Christie was thinking over<lb>
this interview so intently that she started when David's<lb>
voice said close beside her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I disturb you if I say, `Good-night'?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were not going to say it at all,&rdquo;<lb>
she answered rather sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 've been looking for a chance; but you were so<lb>
absorbed with that man I had to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering the elegance of `that man,' you don't<lb>
treat him with much respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't feel much. What brought him here, I wonder.<lb>
A French <hi rend="italics">salon</hi> is more in his line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to see Mr. Power, as every one else does,<lb>
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't dodge, Christie: you know he came to see<lb>
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like him?&rdquo; she asked, with treacherous<lb>
abruptness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly, so far. But if I knew him, I dare<lb>
say I should find many good traits in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you would!&rdquo; said Christie, warmly, not<lb>
thinking of Fletcher, but of David's kindly way of<lb>
finding good in every one.</p>
<pb n="320">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-331">

<figdesc>Page 320.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have improved since you saw him last;<lb>
for then, if I remember rightly, you found him `lazy,<lb>
cross, selfish, and conceited.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, David, I never said any thing of the sort,&rdquo;<lb>
began Christie, wondering what possessed him to be so<lb>
satirical and short with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did, last September, sitting on the old<lb>
apple-tree the morning of your birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an inconvenient memory you have! Well,<lb>
he <hi rend="italics">was</hi> all that then; but he is not an invalid now, and<lb>
so we see his real self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also remember that you gave me the impression<lb>
that he was an elderly man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn't forty elderly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn't forty when you taught his siter's children.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but he looked older than he does now, being<lb>
so ill. I used to think he would be very handsome<lb>
with good health; and now I see I was right,&rdquo; said<lb>
Christie, with feigned enthusiasm; for it was a new<lb>
thing to tease David, and she liked it.</p>
<p>But she got no more of it; for, just then, the singer<lb>
began to sing to the select few who remained, and<lb>
every one was silent. Leaning on the high back of<lb>
Christie's chair, David watched the reflection of her<lb>
face in the long mirror; for she listened to the music<lb>
with downcast eyes, unconscious what eloquent expressions<lb>
were passing over her countenance. She<lb>
seemed a new Christie to David, in that excited mood;<lb>
and, as he watched her, he thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She loved this man once, or he loved her; and to-night<lb>
it all comes back to her. How will it end?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="321">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-332">

<figdesc>Page 321.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<milestn unit="collation" n="14* U">
<p>So earnestly did he try to read that altered face that<lb>
Christie felt the intentness of his gaze, looked up suddenly,<lb>
and met his eyes in the glass. Something in the<lb>
expression of those usually serene eyes, now darkened<lb>
and dilated with the intensity of that long scrutiny,<lb>
surprised and troubled her; and, scarcely knowing what<lb>
she said, she asked quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you admiring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you 'd think me vain if I asked you<lb>
something that I want to know?&rdquo; she said, obeying a<lb>
sudden impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask it, and I 'll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I much changed since you first knew me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the better or the worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The better, decidedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I hoped so; but one never knows how<lb>
one seems to other people. I was wondering what<lb>
you saw in the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good and lovely woman, Christie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How sweet it sounded to hear David say that! so<lb>
simply and sincerely that it was far more than a mere<lb>
compliment. She did not thank him, but said softly as<lb>
if to herself:<lb>
<q><p>&ldquo;So let me seem until I be&rdquo;</p></q>
&mdash; and then sat silent, so full of satisfaction in the<lb>
thought that David found her &ldquo;good and lovely,&rdquo; she<lb>
could not resist stealing a glance at the tell-tale mirror<lb>
to see if she might believe him.</p>
<p>She forgot herself, however; for he was off guard now,<lb>
and stood looking away with brows knit, lips tightly<lb>
<pb n="322">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-333">

<figdesc>Page 322.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
set, and eyes fixed, yet full of fire; his whole attitude<lb>
and expression that of a man intent on subduing some<lb>
strong impulse by a yet stronger will.</p>
<p>It startled Christie; and she leaned forward, watching<lb>
him with breathless interest till the song ceased, and,<lb>
with the old impatient gesture, David seemed to relapse<lb>
into his accustomed quietude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the wonderful music that excited him: that<lb>
was all;&rdquo; thought Christie; yet, when he came round<lb>
to say good-night, the strange expression was not gone,<lb>
and his manner was not his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall <hi rend="italics">I</hi> ask if I may come again,&rdquo; he said, imitating<lb>
Mr. Fletcher's graceful bow with an odd smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let him come because he has lost his sister, and is<lb>
lonely,&rdquo; began Christie, but got no further, for David<lb>
said, &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; abruptly, and was gone without a<lb>
word to Mr. Power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He 's in a hurry to get back to his Kitty,&rdquo; she<lb>
thought, tormenting herself with feminine skill. &ldquo;Never<lb>
mind,&rdquo; she added, with a defiant sort of smile; &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I 've</hi><lb>
got my Philip, handsomer and more in love than ever,<lb>
if I 'm not deceived. I wonder if he <hi rend="italics">will</hi> come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher did come again, and with flattering regularity,<lb>
for several weeks, evidently finding something<lb>
very attractive in those novel gatherings. Mr. Power<lb>
soon saw why he came; and, as Christie seemed to enjoy<lb>
his presence, the good man said nothing to disturb her,<lb>
though he sometimes cast an anxious glance toward the<lb>
recess where the two usually sat, apparently busy with<lb>
books or pictures; yet, by their faces, showing that an<lb>
under current of deeper interest than art or literature<lb>
flowed through their intercourse.</p>
<pb n="323">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-334">

<figdesc>Page 323.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Christie had not deceived herself, and it was evident<lb>
that her old lover meant to try his fate again, if she<lb>
continued to smile upon him as she had done of late.<lb>
He showed her his sunny side now, and very pleasant<lb>
she found it. The loss of his sister had touched his<lb>
heart, and made him long to fill the place her death<lb>
left vacant. Better health sweetened his temper, and<lb>
woke the desire to do something worth the doing; and<lb>
the sight of the only woman he had ever really loved,<lb>
reawakened the sentiment that had not died, and made<lb>
it doubly sweet.</p>
<p>Why he cared for Christie he could not tell, but he<lb>
never had forgotten her; and, when he met her again<lb>
with that new beauty in her face, he felt that time had<lb>
only ripened the blithe girl into a deep-hearted woman,<lb>
and he loved her with a better love than before. His<lb>
whole manner showed this; for the half-careless, half-condescending<lb>
air of former times was replaced by the<lb>
most courteous respect, a sincere desire to win her<lb>
favor, and at times the tender sort of devotion women<lb>
find so charming.</p>
<p>Christie felt all this, enjoyed it, and tried to be<lb>
grateful for it in the way he wished, thinking that hearts<lb>
could be managed like children, and when one toy is<lb>
unattainable, be appeased by a bigger or a brighter one<lb>
of another sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must love some one,&rdquo; she said, as she leaned over<lb>
a basket of magnificent flowers just left for her by Mr.<lb>
Fletcher's servant, a thing which often happened now.<lb>
&ldquo;Philip has loved me with a fidelity that ought to touch<lb>
my heart. Why not accept him, and enjoy a new life<lb>
of luxury, novelty, and pleasure? All these things he<lb>
<pb n="324">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-335">

<figdesc>Page 324.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
can give me: all these things are valued, admired, and<lb>
sought for; and who would appreciate them more than<lb>
I? I could travel, cultivate myself in many delightful<lb>
ways, and do so much good. No matter if I was not<lb>
very happy: I should make Philip so, and have it in my<lb>
power to comfort many poor souls. That ought to satisfy<lb>
me; for what is nobler than to live for others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea attracted her, as it does all generous natures;<lb>
she became enamoured of self-sacrifice, and almost persuaded<lb>
herself that it was her duty to marry Mr.<lb>
Fletcher, whether she loved him or not, in order that<lb>
she might dedicate her life to the service of poorer,<lb>
sadder creatures than herself.</p>
<p>But in spite of this amiable delusion, in spite of the<lb>
desire to forget the love she would have in the love she<lb>
might have, and in spite of the great improvement in<lb>
her faithful Philip, Christie could not blind herself to<lb>
the fact that her head, rather than her heart, advised<lb>
the match; she could not conquer a suspicion that, however<lb>
much Mr. Fletcher might love his wife, he would<lb>
be something of a tyrant, and she was very sure she<lb>
never would make a good slave. In her cooler moments<lb>
she remembered that men are not puppets, to<lb>
be moved as a woman's will commands, and the uncertainty<lb>
of being able to carry out her charitable plans<lb>
made her pause to consider whether she would not be<lb>
selling her liberty too cheaply, if in return she got only<lb>
dependence and bondage along with fortune and a<lb>
home.</p>
<p>So tempted and perplexed, self-deluded and self-warned,<lb>
attracted and repelled, was poor Christie, that<lb>
she began to feel as if she had got into a labyrinth<lb>
<pb n="325">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-336">

<figdesc>Page 325.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
without any clew to bring her safely out. She longed<lb>
to ask advice of some one, but could not turn to Mrs.<lb>
Sterling; and what other woman friend had she except<lb>
Rachel, from whom she had not heard for months?</p>
<p>As she asked herself this question one day, feeling<lb>
sure that Mr. Fletcher would come in the evening, and<lb>
would soon put his fortune to the touch again, the<lb>
thought of Mrs. Wilkins seemed to answer her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Christie: &ldquo;she is sensible, kind,<lb>
and discreet; she may put me right, for I 'm all in a<lb>
tangle now with doubts and fears, feelings and fancies.<lb>
I 'll go and see her: that will do me good, even<lb>
if I don't say a word about my `werryments,' as the<lb>
dear soul would call them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away she went, and fortunately found her friend<lb>
alone in the &ldquo;settin'-room,&rdquo; darning away at a perfect<lb>
stack of socks, as she creaked comfortably to and fro<lb>
in her old rocking-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was jest wishin' somebody would drop in: it 's<lb>
so kinder lonesome with the children to school and<lb>
Adelaide asleep. How be you, dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins,<lb>
with a hospitable hug and a beaming smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm worried in my mind, so I came to see you,&rdquo;<lb>
answered Christie, sitting down with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your dear heart, what <hi rend="italics">is</hi> to pay. Free your<lb>
mind, and I 'll do my best to lend a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mere sound of that hearty voice comforted<lb>
Christie, and gave her courage to introduce the little<lb>
fiction under which she had decided to defraud Mrs.<lb>
Wilkins of her advice. So she helped herself to a<lb>
very fragmentary blue sock and a big needle, that she<lb>
might have employment for her eyes, as they were not<lb>
<pb n="326">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-337">

<figdesc>Page 326.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
so obedient as her tongue, and then began in as easy a<lb>
tone as she could assume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see a friend of mine wants my advice on<lb>
a very serious matter, and I really don't know what to<lb>
give her. It is strictly confidential, you know, so I<lb>
won't mention any names, but just set the case before<lb>
you and get your opinion, for I 've great faith in your<lb>
sensible way of looking at things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanky, dear, you 'r welcome to my 'pinion ef it 's<lb>
wuth any thing. Be these folks you tell of young?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Mrs. Wilkins, with evident relish for the mystery.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the woman is past thirty, and the man 'most<lb>
forty, I believe,&rdquo; said Christie, darning away in some<lb>
trepidation at having taken the first plunge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My patience! ain't the creater old enough to know<lb>
her own mind? for I s'pose she 's the one in the quanderry?&rdquo;<lb>
exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins, looking over her<lb>
spectacles with dangerously keen eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case is this,&rdquo; said Christie, in guilty haste.<lb>
&ldquo;The `creature' is poor and nobody, the man rich and<lb>
of good family, so you see it 's rather hard for her to<lb>
decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don't see nothin' of the sort,&rdquo; returned blunt<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins. &ldquo;Ef she loves the man, take him: ef<lb>
she don't, give him the mittin and done with it. Money<lb>
and friends and family ain't much to do with the matter<lb>
accordin' to my view. It 's jest a plain question<lb>
betwixt them two. Ef it takes much settlin' they 'd<lb>
better let it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn't love him as much as she might, I fancy,<lb>
but she is tired of grubbing along alone. He is very<lb>
<pb n="327">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-338">

<figdesc>Page 327.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fond of her, and very rich; and it would be a fine thing<lb>
for her in a worldly way, I 'm sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she 's goin' to marry for a livin' is she? Wal,<lb>
now I 'd ruther one of my girls should grub the wust<lb>
kind all their days than do that. Hows'ever, it may<lb>
suit some folks ef they ain't got much heart, and is<lb>
contented with fine clothes, nice vittles, and handsome<lb>
furnitoor. Selfish, cold, silly kinder women might git<lb>
on, I dare say; but I shouldn't think any friend of<lb>
your'n would be one of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she might do a great deal of good, and make<lb>
others happy even if she was not so herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might, but I doubt it, for money got that way<lb>
wouldn't prosper wal. Mis'able folks ain't half so<lb>
charitable as happy ones; and I don't believe five dollars<lb>
from one of 'em would go half so fur, or be half<lb>
so comfortin' as a kind word straight out of a cheerful<lb>
heart. I know some thinks that is a dreadful smart<lb>
thing to do; but <hi rend="italics">I</hi> don't, and ef any one wants to go a<lb>
sacrificin' herself for the good of others, there 's better<lb>
ways of doin' it than startin' with a lie in her mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins spoke warmly; for Christie's face made<lb>
her fiction perfectly transparent, though the good woman<lb>
with true delicacy showed no sign of intelligence on<lb>
that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you wouldn't advise my friend to say yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive, no! I 'd say to her as I did to my<lb>
younger sisters when their courtin' time come: `Jest<lb>
be sure you 're right as to there bein' love enough, then<lb>
go ahead, and the Lord will bless you.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they follow your advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did, and both is prosperin' in different ways.<lb>
<pb n="328">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-339">

<figdesc>Page 328.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Gusty, she found she was well on't for love, so she married,<lb>
though Samuel Buck was poor, and they 're happy<lb>
as can be a workin' up together, same as Lisha and me<lb>
did. Addy, she calc'lated she wan't satisfied somehow,<lb>
so she <hi rend="italics">didn't</hi> marry, though James Miller was wal off;<lb>
and she 's kep stiddy to her trade, and ain't never<lb>
repented. There 's a sight said and writ about such<lb>
things,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Wilkins, rambling on to give<lb>
Christie time to think; &ldquo;but I 've an idee that women's<lb>
hearts is to be trusted ef they ain't been taught all<lb>
wrong. Jest let 'em remember that they take a husband<lb>
for wuss as well as better (and there 's a sight of<lb>
wuss in this tryin' world for some on us), and be ready<lb>
to do their part patient and faithful, and I ain't a<lb>
grain afraid but what they 'll be fetched through, always<lb>
pervidin' they love the man and not his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause after that last speech, and Christie<lb>
felt as if her perplexity was clearing away very fast; for<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins's plain talk seemed to show her things in<lb>
their true light, with all the illusions of false sentiment<lb>
and false reasoning stripped away. She felt<lb>
clearer and stronger already, and as if she could make<lb>
up her mind very soon when one other point had been<lb>
discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy my friend is somewhat influenced by the<lb>
fact that this man loved and asked her to marry him<lb>
some years ago. He has not forgotten her, and this<lb>
touches her heart more than any thing else. It seems<lb>
as if his love must be genuine to last so long, and not<lb>
to mind her poverty, want of beauty, and accomplishments;<lb>
for he is a proud and fastidious man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think wal of him for that!&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins,<lb>
<pb n="329">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-340">

<figdesc>Page 329.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
approvingly; &ldquo;but I guess she 's wuth all he gives her,<lb>
for there must be somethin' pretty gennywin' in her<lb>
to make him overlook her lacks and hold on so stiddy.<lb>
It don't alter <hi rend="italics">her</hi> side of the case one mite though; for<lb>
love is love, and ef she ain't got it, he 'd better not<lb>
take gratitude instid, but sheer off and leave her for<lb>
somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody else wants her!&rdquo; broke from Christie like<lb>
an involuntary cry of pain; then she hid her face by<lb>
stopping to gather up the avalanche of hosiery which<lb>
fell from her lap to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can't be sure of that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
cheerily, though her spectacles were dim with sudden<lb>
mist. &ldquo;I know there 's a mate for her somewheres, so<lb>
she 'd better wait a spell and trust in Providence. It<lb>
wouldn't be so pleasant to see the right one come along<lb>
after she 'd went and took the wrong one in a hurry:<lb>
would it? Waitin' is always safe, and time needn't<lb>
be wasted in frettin' or bewailin'; for the Lord knows<lb>
there 's a sight of good works sufferin' to be done, and<lb>
single women has the best chance at 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 've accomplished one good work at any rate; and,<lb>
small as it is, I feel better for it. Give this sock to<lb>
your husband, and tell him his wife sets a good example<lb>
both by precept and practice to other women, married<lb>
or single. Thank you very much, both for myself and<lb>
my friend, who shall profit by your advice,&rdquo; said Christie,<lb>
feeling that she had better go before she told every<lb>
thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she will,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Wilkins, as her<lb>
guest went away with a much happier face than the<lb>
one she brought. &ldquo;And ef I know her, which I think<lb>
<pb n="330">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-341">

<figdesc>Page 330.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
I do, she 'll find that Cinthy Wilkins ain't fur from<lb>
right, ef her experience is good for any thing,&rdquo; added<lb>
the matron with a sigh, and a glance at a dingy photograph<lb>
of her Lisha on the wall, a sigh that seemed to<lb>
say there had been a good deal of &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">wuss</hi>&rdquo; in her bargain,<lb>
though she was too loyal to confess it.</p>
<p>Something in Christie's face struck Mr. Fletcher at<lb>
once when he appeared that evening. He had sometimes<lb>
found her cold and quiet, often gay and capricious,<lb>
usually earnest and cordial, with a wistful look<lb>
that searched his face and both won and checked him<lb>
by its mute appeal, seeming to say, &ldquo;Wait a little till<lb>
I have taught my heart to answer as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-night her eyes shunned his, and when he caught<lb>
a glimpse of them they were full of a soft trouble;<lb>
her manner was kinder than ever before, and yet it<lb>
made him anxious, for there was a resolute expression<lb>
about her lips even when she smiled, and though<lb>
he ventured upon allusions to the past hitherto tacitly<lb>
avoided, she listened as if it had no tender charm for<lb>
her.</p>
<p>Being thoroughly in earnest now, Mr. Fletcher resolved<lb>
to ask the momentous question again without delay.<lb>
David was not there, and had not been for several<lb>
weeks, another thorn in Christie's heart, though she<lb>
showed no sign of regret, and said to herself, &ldquo;It is<lb>
better so.&rdquo; His absence left Fletcher master of the<lb>
field, and he seized the propitious moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you show me the new picture? Mr. Power<lb>
spoke of it, but I do not like to trouble him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; and Christie led the way to a<lb>
little room where the newly arrived gift was placed.<lb>
<pb n="331">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-342">

<figdesc>Page 331.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
She knew what was coming, but was ready, and felt<lb>
a tragic sort of satisfaction in the thought of all she<lb>
was relinquishing for love of David.</p>
<p>No one was in the room, but a fine copy of Michael<lb>
Angelo's Fates hung on the wall, looking down at them<lb>
with weird significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look as if they would give a stern answer<lb>
to any questioning of ours,&rdquo; Mr. Fletcher said, after a<lb>
glance of affected interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would give a true one I fancy,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Christie, shading her eyes as if to see the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd rather question a younger, fairer Fate, hoping<lb>
that she will give me an answer both true and kind.<lb>
May I, Christie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be true but &mdash; I cannot be kind.&rdquo; It cost her<lb>
much to say that; yet she did it steadily, though he<lb>
held her hand in both his own, and waited for her<lb>
words with ardent expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet perhaps, &mdash; but in time, when I have proved<lb>
how sincere my love is, how entire my repentance for<lb>
the ungenerous words you have not forgotten. I wanted<lb>
you then for my own sake, now I want you for yourself,<lb>
because I love and honor you above all women. I tried<lb>
to forget you, but I could not; and all these years have<lb>
carried in my heart a very tender memory of the girl<lb>
who dared to tell me that all I could offer her was<lb>
not worth her love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was mistaken,&rdquo; began Christie, finding this wooing<lb>
much harder to withstand than the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you were right: I felt it then and resented it,<lb>
but I owned it later, and regretted it more bitterly than<lb>
I can tell. I 'm not worthy of you; I never shall be: but<lb>
<pb n="332">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-343">

<figdesc>Page 332.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
I 've loved you for five years without hope, and I 'll<lb>
wait five more if in the end you will come to me.<lb>
Christie, I need you very much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Mr. Fletcher had gone down upon his knees and<lb>
poured out the most ardent protestations that ever left<lb>
a lover's lips, it would not have touched her as did that<lb>
last little appeal, uttered with a break in the voice that<lb>
once was so proud and was so humble now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; she cried, looking up at him with<lb>
real respect in her face, and real remorse smiting her<lb>
conscience. &ldquo;Forgive me! I have misled you and myself.<lb>
I tried to love you: I was grateful for your regard,<lb>
touched by your fidelity, and I hoped I might repay it;<lb>
but I cannot! I cannot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a hard question! She owed him all the truth,<lb>
yet how could she tell it? She could not in words,<lb>
but her face did, for the color rose and burned on<lb>
cheeks and forehead with painful fervor; her eyes<lb>
fell, and her lips trembled as if endeavoring to keep<lb>
down the secret that was escaping against her will.<lb>
A moment of silence as Mr. Fletcher searched for<lb>
the truth and found it; then he said with such sharp<lb>
pain in his voice that Christie's heart ached at the<lb>
sound:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see: I am too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is no hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is nothing more for me to say but<lb>
good-by. May you be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be; &mdash; I have no hope; &mdash; I only try to be<lb>
<pb n="333">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-344">

<figdesc>Page 333.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
true to you and to myself. Oh, believe it, and pity me<lb>
as I do you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the words broke from Christie, she covered up<lb>
her face, bowed down with the weight of remorse<lb>
that made her long to atone for what she had done<lb>
by any self-humiliation.</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher was at his best at that moment; for<lb>
real love ennobles the worst and weakest while it<lb>
lasts: but he could not resist the temptation that confession<lb>
offered him. He tried to be generous, but the<lb>
genuine virtue was not in him; he did want Christie<lb>
very much, and the knowledge of a rival in her heart<lb>
only made her the dearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm not content with your pity, sweet as it is: I<lb>
want your love, and I believe that I might earn it<lb>
if you would let me try. You are all alone, and life is<lb>
hard to you: come to me and let me make it happier.<lb>
I 'll be satisfied with friendship till you can give me<lb>
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this very tenderly, caressing the bent head<lb>
while he spoke, and trying to express by tone and<lb>
gesture how eagerly he longed to receive and cherish<lb>
what that other man neglected.</p>
<p>Christie felt this to her heart's core, and for a moment<lb>
longed to end the struggle, say, &ldquo;Take me,&rdquo; and accept<lb>
the shadow for the substance. But those last words of<lb>
his vividly recalled the compact made with David that<lb>
happy birthday night. How could she be his friend if<lb>
she was Mr. Fletcher's wife? She knew she could not<lb>
be true to both, while her heart reversed the sentiment<lb>
she then would owe them: David's friendship was<lb>
dearer than Philip's love, and she would keep it at all<lb>
<pb n="334">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-345">

<figdesc>Page 334.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
costs. These thoughts flashed through her mind in the<lb>
drawing of a breath, and she looked up, saying steadily<lb>
in spite of wet eyes and still burning cheeks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope nothing; wait for nothing from me. I will<lb>
have no more delusions for either of us: it is weak<lb>
and wicked, for I know I shall not change. Some time<lb>
we may venture to be friends perhaps, but not now.<lb>
Forgive me, and be sure I shall suffer more than you<lb>
for this mistake of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had denied his suit before he had been<lb>
ungenerous and angry; for his pride was hurt and his<lb>
will thwarted: now his heart bled and hope died hard;<lb>
but all that was manliest in him rose to help him bear<lb>
the loss, for <hi rend="italics">this</hi> love was genuine, and made him both<lb>
just and kind. His face was pale with the pain of that<lb>
fruitless passion, and his voice betrayed how hard he<lb>
strove for self-control, as he said hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">You</hi> need not suffer: this mistake has given me<lb>
the happiest hours of my life, and I am better for having<lb>
known so sweet and true a woman. God bless you,<lb>
Christie!&rdquo; and with a quick embrace that startled her<lb>
by its suddenness and strength he left her, standing<lb>
there alone before the three grim Fates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOW it is all over. I shall never have another<lb>
chance like that, and must make up my mind to<lb>
be a lonely and laborious spinster all my life. Youth<lb>
is going fast, and I have little in myself to attract or<lb>
win, though David did call me `good and lovely.'<lb>
Ah, well, I 'll try to deserve his praise, and not let disappointment<lb>
sour or sadden me. Better to hope and<lb>
wait all my life than marry without love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie often said this to herself during the hard<lb>
days that followed Mr. Fletcher's disappearance; a<lb>
disappearance, by the way, which caused Mr. Power<lb>
much satisfaction, though he only betrayed it by added<lb>
kindness to Christie, and in his manner an increased<lb>
respect very comforting to her.</p>
<p>But she missed her lover, for nothing now broke up<lb>
the monotony of a useful life. She had enjoyed that<lb>
little episode; for it had lent romance to every thing<lb>
while it lasted, even the charity basket with which she<lb>
went her rounds; for Mr. Fletcher often met her by accident<lb>
apparently, and carried it as if to prove the sincerity<lb>
of his devotion. No bouquets came now; no<lb>
graceful little notes with books or invitations to some<lb>
coveted pleasure; no dangerously delightful evenings<lb>
in the recess, where, for a time, she felt and used the<lb>
<pb n="336">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-347">

</eaffig>
power which to a woman is so full of subtle satisfaction;<lb>
no bitter-sweet hopes; no exciting dreams of what<lb>
might be with the utterance of a word; no soft uncertainty<lb>
to give a charm to every hour that passed.<lb>
Nothing but daily duties, a little leisure that hung<lb>
heavy on her hands with no hope to stimulate, no<lb>
lover to lighten it, and a sore, sad heart that would<lb>
clamor for its right; and even when pride silenced it<lb>
ached on with the dull pain which only time and patience<lb>
have the power to heal.</p>
<p>But as those weeks went slowly by, she began to<lb>
discover some of the miracles true love can work. She<lb>
thought she had laid it in its grave; but an angel<lb>
rolled the stone away, and the lost passion rose stronger,<lb>
purer, and more beautiful than when she buried it with<lb>
bitter tears. A spirit now, fed by no hope, warmed by<lb>
no tenderness, clothed in no fond delusion; the vital<lb>
soul of love which outlives the fairest, noblest form<lb>
humanity can give it, and sits among the ruins singing<lb>
the immortal hymn of consolation the Great Musician<lb>
taught.</p>
<p>Christie felt this strange comfort resting like a baby<lb>
in her lonely bosom, cherished and blessed it; wondering<lb>
while she rejoiced, and soon perceiving with the<lb>
swift instinct of a woman, that this was a lesson, hard<lb>
to learn, but infinitely precious, helpful, and sustaining<lb>
when once gained. She was not happy, only patient;<lb>
not hopeful, but trusting; and when life looked dark<lb>
and barren without, she went away into that inner<lb>
world of deep feeling, high thought, and earnest aspiration;<lb>
which is a never-failing refuge to those whose<lb>
experience has built within them</p>

<q><p>&ldquo;The nunnery of a chaste heart and quiet mind.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>Some women live fast; and Christie fought her battle,<lb>
won her victory, and found peace declared during that<lb>
winter: for her loyalty to love brought its own reward<lb>
in time, giving her the tranquil steadfastness which<lb>
comes to those who submit and ask nothing but fortitude.<lb>
</p>
<p>She had seen little of David, except at church, and<lb>
began to regard him almost as one might a statue on<lb>
a tomb, the marble effigy of the beloved dead below;<lb>
for the sweet old friendship was only a pale shadow<lb>
now. He always found her out, gave her the posy she<lb>
best liked, said cheerfully, &ldquo;How goes it, Christie?&rdquo;<lb>
and she always answered, &ldquo;Good-morning, David. I<lb>
am well and busy, thank you.&rdquo; Then they sat together<lb>
listening to Mr. Power, sung from the same book,<lb>
walked a little way together, and parted for another<lb>
week with a hand-shake for good-by.</p>
<p>Christie often wondered what prayers David prayed<lb>
when he sat so still with his face hidden by his hand,<lb>
and looked up with such a clear and steady look when<lb>
he had done. She tried to do the same; but her<lb>
thoughts would wander to the motionless gray figure<lb>
beside her, and she felt as if peace and strength unconsciously<lb>
flowed from it to sustain and comfort her.<lb>
Some of her happiest moments were those she spent<lb>
sitting there, pale and silent, with absent eyes, and lips<lb>
that trembled now and then, hidden by the flowers held<lb>
before them, kissed covertly, and kept like relics long<lb>
after they were dead.</p>
<p>One bitter drop always marred the pleasure of that<lb>
<pb n="338">

hour; for when she had asked for Mrs. Sterling, and<lb>
sent her love, she forced herself to say kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Kitty, is she doing well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capitally; come and see how she has improved;<lb>
we are quite proud of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if I can find time. It 's a hard winter and<lb>
we have so much to do,&rdquo; she would answer smiling,<lb>
and then go home to struggle back into the patient<lb>
mood she tried to make habitual.</p>
<p>But she seldom made time to go and see Kitty's<lb>
improvement; and, when she did run out for an hour<lb>
she failed to discover any thing, except that the girl was<lb>
prettier and more coquettish than ever, and assumed<lb>
airs of superiority that tried Christie very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready for any thing,&rdquo; she always said with a<lb>
resolute air after one of these visits; but, when the<lb>
time seemed to have come she was not so ready as she<lb>
fancied.</p>
<p>Passing out of a store one day, she saw Kitty all in<lb>
her best, buying white gloves with a most important<lb>
air. &ldquo;That looks suspicious,&rdquo; she thought, and could<lb>
not resist speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well at home?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma and I have been alone for nearly a week;<lb>
David went off on business; but he 's back now and &mdash;<lb>
oh, my goodness! I forgot: I 'm not to tell a soul<lb>
yet;&rdquo; and Kitty pursed up her lips, looking quite oppressed<lb>
with some great secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, how mysterious! Well, I won't ask any<lb>
dangerous questions, only tell me if the dear old lady<lb>
is well,&rdquo; said Christie, desperately curious, but too<lb>
proud to show it.</p>
<pb n="339">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-350">

<figdesc>Page 339.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;She 's well, but dreadfully upset by what 's happened;<lb>
well she may be.&rdquo; And Kitty shook her head<lb>
with a look of mingled mystery and malicious merriment.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sterling is all right I hope?&rdquo; Christie never<lb>
called him David to Kitty; so that impertinent little<lb>
person took especial pains to speak familiarly, sometimes<lb>
even fondly of him to Christie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear fellow! he 's so happy he don't know what to<lb>
do with himself. I just wish you could see him go<lb>
round smiling, and singing, and looking as if he 'd like<lb>
to dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks as if he was going to get a chance to do<lb>
it,&rdquo; said Christie, with a glance at the gloves, as Kitty<lb>
turned from the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is!&rdquo; laughed Kitty, patting the little parcel<lb>
with a joyful face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe you are going to be married:&rdquo; exclaimed<lb>
Christie, half distracted with curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, but not to Miles. Now don't you say another<lb>
word, for I 'm dying to tell, and I promised I wouldn't.<lb>
David wants to do it himself. By-by.&rdquo; And Kitty<lb>
hurried away, leaving Christie as pale as if she had seen<lb>
a ghost at noonday.</p>
<p>She had; for the thought of David's marrying Kitty<lb>
had haunted her all those months, and now she was<lb>
quite sure the blow had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she was only a nobler woman I could bear it<lb>
better; but I am sure he will regret it when the first<lb>
illusion is past. I fancy she reminds him of his lost<lb>
Letty, and so he thinks he loves her. I pray he may<lb>
be happy, and I hope it will be over soon,&rdquo; thought<lb>
<pb n="340">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-351">

<figdesc>Page 340.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Christie, with a groan, as she trudged away to carry<lb>
comfort to those whose woes could be relieved by tea<lb>
and sugar, flannel petticoats, and orders for a ton of<lb>
coal.</p>
<p>It <hi rend="italics">was</hi> over soon, but not as Christie had expected.</p>
<p>That evening Mr. Power was called away, and she<lb>
sat alone, bravely trying to forget suspense and grief in<lb>
copying the record of her last month's labor. But she<lb>
made sad work of it; for her mind was full of David<lb>
and his wife, so happy in the little home which had<lb>
grown doubly dear to her since she left it. No wonder<lb>
then that she put down &ldquo;two dozen children&rdquo; to Mrs.<lb>
Flanagan, and &ldquo;four knit hoods&rdquo; with the measles;<lb>
or that a great blot fell upon &ldquo;twenty yards red flannel,&rdquo;<lb>
as the pen dropped from the hands she clasped<lb>
together; saying with all the fervor of true self-abnegation:<lb>
&ldquo;I hope he will be happy; oh, I hope he will be<lb>
happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If ever woman deserved reward for patient endeavor,<lb>
hard-won submission, and unselfish love, Christie did<lb>
then. And she received it in full measure; for the<lb>
dear Lord requites some faithful hearts, blesses some<lb>
lives that seem set apart for silent pain and solitary<lb>
labor.</p>
<p>Snow was falling fast, and a bitter wind moaned<lb>
without; the house was very still, and nothing stirred<lb>
in the room but the flames dancing on the hearth, and<lb>
the thin hand moving to and fro among the records of<lb>
a useful life.</p>
<p>Suddenly the bell rang loudly and repeatedly, as if<lb>
the new-comer was impatient of delay. Christie paused<lb>
to listen. It was not Mr. Power's ring, not his voice in<lb>
<pb n="341">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-352">

<figdesc>Page 341.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
the hall below, not his step that came leaping up the<lb>
stairs, nor his hand that threw wide the door. She<lb>
knew them all, and her heart stood still an instant;<lb>
then she gathered up her strength, said low to herself,<lb>
&ldquo;Now it is coming,&rdquo; and was ready for the truth, with<lb>
a colorless face; eyes unnaturally bright and fixed; and<lb>
one hand on her breast, as if to hold in check the rebellious<lb>
heart that would throb so fast.</p>
<p>It was David who came in with such impetuosity.<lb>
Snow-flakes shone in his hair; the glow of the keen<lb>
wind was on his cheek, a smile on his lips, and in his<lb>
eyes an expression she had never seen before. Happiness,<lb>
touched with the shadow of some past pain;<lb>
doubt and desire; gratitude and love, &mdash; all seemed to<lb>
meet and mingle in it; while, about the whole man,<lb>
was the free and ardent air of one relieved from some<lb>
heavy burden, released from some long captivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O David, what is it?&rdquo; cried Christie, as he stood<lb>
looking at her with this strange look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;News, Christie! such happy news I can't find<lb>
words to tell them,&rdquo; he answered, coming nearer, but<lb>
too absorbed in his own emotion to heed hers.</p>
<p>She drew a long breath and pressed her hand a little<lb>
heavier on her breast, as she said, with the ghost of a<lb>
smile, more pathetic than the saddest tears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he demanded, as if defrauded of a joy he<lb>
had set his heart upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Kitty, &mdash; she told me nothing, &mdash; but her face<lb>
betrayed what I have long suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed, such a glad yet scornful laugh, and,<lb>
snatching a little miniature from his pocket, offered<lb>
<pb n="342">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-353">

<figdesc>Page 342.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
it, saying, with the new impetuosity that changed him<lb>
so:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">That</hi> is the daughter I have found for my mother.<lb>
You know her, &mdash; you love her; and you will not be<lb>
ashamed to welcome her, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie took it; saw a faded, time-worn likeness of<lb>
a young girl's happy face; a face strangely familiar,<lb>
yet, for a moment, she groped to find the name<lb>
belonging to it. Then memory helped her; and she<lb>
said, half incredulously, half joyfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it my Rachel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <hi rend="italics">my</hi> Letty!&rdquo; cried David, with an accent of<lb>
such mingled love and sorrow, remorse and joy, that<lb>
Christie seemed to hear in it the death-knell of her<lb>
faith in him. The picture fell from the hands she put<lb>
up, as if to ward off some heavy blow, and her voice<lb>
was sharp with reproachful anguish, as she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O David, David, any thing but that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instant he seemed bewildered, then the meaning<lb>
of the grief in her face flashed on him, and his own<lb>
grew white with indignant repudiation of the thought<lb>
that daunted her; but he only said with the stern<lb>
brevity of truth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Letty is my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, &mdash; how could I know? Oh, thank<lb>
God! thank God!&rdquo; and, dropping down upon a chair,<lb>
Christie broke into a passion of the happiest tears she<lb>
ever shed.</p>
<p>David stood beside her silent, till the first irrepressible<lb>
paroxysm was over; then, while she sat weeping<lb>
softly, quite bowed down by emotion, he said, sadly<lb>
now, not sternly:</p>
<pb n="343">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-354">

<figdesc>Page 343.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could <hi rend="italics">not</hi> know, because we hid the truth so<lb>
carefully. I have no right to resent that belief of<lb>
yours, for I did wrong my poor Letty, almost as much<lb>
as that lover of hers, who, being dead, I do not curse.<lb>
Let me tell you every thing, Christie, before I ask your<lb>
respect and confidence again. I never deserved them,<lb>
but I tried to; for they were very precious to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a moment, then went on rapidly, as if<lb>
anxious to accomplish a hard task; and Christie forgot<lb>
to weep while listening breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Letty was the pride of my heart; and I loved her<lb>
very dearly, for she was all I had. Such a pretty child;<lb>
such a gay, sweet girl; how could I help it, when she<lb>
was so fond of me? We were poor then, &mdash; poorer<lb>
than now, &mdash; and she grew restless; tired of hard work;<lb>
longed for a little pleasure, and could not bear to waste<lb>
her youth and beauty in that dull town. I did not<lb>
blame my little girl; but I could not help her, for I<lb>
was tugging away to fill father's place, he being broken<lb>
down and helpless. She wanted to go away and support<lb>
herself. <hi rend="italics">You</hi> know the feeling; and I need not<lb>
tell you how the proud, high-hearted creature hated<lb>
dependence, even on a brother who would have worked<lb>
his soul out for her. She <hi rend="italics">would</hi> go, and we had faith<lb>
in her. For a time she did bravely; but life was too<lb>
hard for her; pleasure too alluring, and, when temptation<lb>
came in the guise of love, she could not resist.<lb>
One dreadful day, news came that she was gone, never<lb>
to come back, my innocent little Letty, any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice failed there, and he walked fast through<lb>
the room, as if the memory of that bitter day was still<lb>
unbearable. Christie could not speak for very pity;<lb>
<pb n="344">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-355">

<figdesc>Page 344.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
and he soon continued, pacing restlessly before her, as<lb>
he had often done when she sat by, wondering what<lb>
unquiet spirit drove him to and fro:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the beginning of my trouble; but not<lb>
the worst of it: God forgive me, not the worst!<lb>
Father was very feeble, and the shock killed him;<lb>
mother's heart was nearly broken, and all the happiness<lb>
was taken out of life for me. But I could bear it,<lb>
heavy as the blow was, for I had no part in that sin<lb>
and sorrow. A year later, there came a letter from<lb>
Letty, &mdash; a penitent, imploring, little letter, asking to<lb>
be forgiven and taken home, for her lover was dead,<lb>
and she alone in a foreign land. How would you<lb>
answer such a letter, Christie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you did; saying: `Come home and let us comfort<lb>
you.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said: `You have killed your father; broken your<lb>
mother's heart; ruined your brother's hopes, and disgraced<lb>
your family. You no longer have a home with<lb>
us; and we never want to see your face again.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;O David, that was cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you did not know me; now you see how<lb>
deceived you have been. A stern, resentful devil possessed<lb>
me then, and I obeyed it. I was very proud;<lb>
full of ambitious plans and jealous love for the few I<lb>
took into my heart. Letty had brought a stain upon<lb>
our honest name that time could never wash away;<lb>
had quenched my hopes in despair and shame; had<lb>
made home desolate, and destroyed my faith in every<lb>
thing; for whom could I trust, when she, the nearest<lb>
and dearest creature in the world, deceived and descrted<lb>
me. I could <hi rend="italics">not</hi> forgive; wrath burned hot<lb>
<pb n="345">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-356">

<figdesc>Page 345.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="15*">
within me, and the desire for retribution would not be<lb>
appeased till those cruel words were said. The retribution<lb>
and remorse came swift and sure; but they<lb>
came most heavily to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still standing where he had paused abruptly as he<lb>
asked his question, David wrung his strong hands together<lb>
with a gesture of passionate regret, while his<lb>
face grew sharp with the remembered suffering of the<lb>
years he had given to the atonement of that wrong.</p>
<p>Christie put her own hand on those clenched ones,<lb>
and whispered softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't tell me any more now: I can wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">must,</hi> and you must listen! I 've longed to tell<lb>
you, but I was afraid; now, you shall know every<lb>
thing, and then decide if you can forgive me for Letty's<lb>
sake,&rdquo; he said, so resolutely that she listened with a<lb>
face full of mute compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little letter came to me; I never told my<lb>
mother, but answered it, and kept silent till news<lb>
arrived that the ship in which Letty had taken passage<lb>
was lost. Remorse had been tugging at my heart;<lb>
and, when I knew that she was dead, I forgave her<lb>
with a vain forgiveness, and mourned for my darling,<lb>
as if she had never left me. I told my mother then,<lb>
and she did not utter one reproach; but age seemed to<lb>
fall upon her all at once, and the pathetic quietude you<lb>
see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, but for her, I should have been desperate;<lb>
for day and night Letty's face haunted me; Letty's<lb>
voice cried: `Take me home!' and every word of<lb>
that imploring letter burned before my eyes as if written<lb>
in fire. Do you wonder now that I hid myself;<lb>
<pb n="346">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-357">

<figdesc>Page 346.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
that I had no heart to try for any honorable place in<lb>
the world, and only struggled to forget, only hoped to<lb>
expiate my sin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his head bowed down upon his breast, David<lb>
stood silent, asking himself if he had even now done<lb>
enough to win the reward he coveted. Christie's voice<lb>
seemed to answer him; for she said, with heartfelt gratitude<lb>
and respect:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you have atoned for that harshness to one<lb>
woman by years of devotion to many. Was it this<lb>
that made you `a brother of girls,' as Mr. Power once<lb>
called you? And, when I asked what he meant, he said<lb>
the Arabs call a man that who has `a clean heart to<lb>
love all women as his sisters, and strength and courage<lb>
to fight for their protection!&rdquo;'</p>
<p>She hoped to lighten his trouble a little, and spoke<lb>
with a smile that was like cordial to poor David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, lifting his head again. &ldquo;I tried to<lb>
be that, and, for Letty's sake, had pity on the most forlorn,<lb>
patience with the most abandoned; always remembering<lb>
that she might have been what they were, if<lb>
death had not been more merciful than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> dead: she was alive and working<lb>
as bravely as you. Ah, how little I thought, when I<lb>
loved Rachel, and she loved me, that we should ever<lb>
meet so happily as we soon shall. Tell me how you<lb>
found her? Does she know I am the woman she once<lb>
saved? Tell me all about her; and tell it fast,&rdquo; prayed<lb>
Christie, getting excited, as she more fully grasped the<lb>
happy fact that Rachel and Letty were one.</p>
<p>David came nearer, and his face kindled as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship sailed without her; she came later; and,<lb>
<pb n="347">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-358">

<figdesc>Page 347.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
finding that her name was among the lost, she did not<lb>
deny it, for she <hi rend="italics">was</hi> dead to us, and decided to remain<lb>
so till she had earned the right to be forgiven. You<lb>
know how she lived and worked, stood firm with no<lb>
one to befriend her till you came, and, by years of<lb>
patient well-doing, washed away her single sin. If<lb>
any one dares think I am ashamed to own her now, let<lb>
him know what cause I have to be proud of her; let<lb>
him come and see how tenderly I love her; how<lb>
devoutly I thank God for permitting me to find and<lb>
bring my little Letty home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the snow-flakes drifting against the windowpane,<lb>
and the wailing of the wind, was heard for a<lb>
moment; then David added, with brightening eyes and<lb>
a glad voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went into a hospital while away, to look after one<lb>
of my poor girls who had been doing well till illness<lb>
brought her there. As I was passing out I saw a sleeping<lb>
face, and stopped involuntarily: it was so like Letty's.<lb>
I never doubted she was dead; the name over the bed<lb>
was not hers; the face was sadly altered from the happy,<lb>
rosy one I knew, but it held me fast; and as I paused<lb>
the eyes opened, &mdash; Letty's own soft eyes, &mdash; they saw<lb>
me, and, as if I was the figure of a dream, she smiled,<lb>
put up her arms and said, just as she used to say, a<lb>
child, when I woke her in her little bed &mdash; `Why,<lb>
Davy!' &mdash; I can't tell any more, &mdash; only that when I<lb>
brought her home and put her in mother's arms, I felt<lb>
as if I was forgiven at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke down there, and went and stood behind the<lb>
window curtains, letting no one see the grateful tears<lb>
that washed away the bitterness of those long years.</p>
<pb n="348">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-359">

<figdesc>Page 348.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Christie had taken up the miniature and was looking<lb>
at it, while her heart sang for joy that the lost was<lb>
found, when David came back to her, wearing the same<lb>
look she had seen the night she listened among the<lb>
cloaks. Moved and happy, with eager eyes and ardent<lb>
manner, yet behind it all a pale expectancy as if some<lb>
great crisis was at hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie, I never can forget that when all others,<lb>
even I, cast Letty off, you comforted and saved her.<lb>
What can I do to thank you for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be my friend, and let me be hers again,&rdquo; she answered,<lb>
too deeply moved to think of any private hope<lb>
or pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the past, now that you know it all, does not<lb>
change your heart to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only makes you dearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I asked you to come back to the home that<lb>
has been desolate since you went, would you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I dared to say I loved you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only looked at him with a quick rising light and<lb>
warmth over her whole face; he stretched both arms<lb>
to her, and going to him, Christie gave her answer<lb>
silently.</p>
<p>Lovers usually ascend straight into the seventh<lb>
heaven for a time: unfortunately they cannot stay<lb>
long; the air is too rarefied, the light too brilliant, the<lb>
fare too ethereal, and they are forced to come down to<lb>
mundane things, as larks drop from heaven's gate into<lb>
their grassy nests. David was summoned from that<lb>
blissful region, after a brief enjoyment of its divine<lb>
delights, by Christie, who looked up from her new refuge<lb>
with the abrupt question:</p>
<pb n="349">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He regarded her with a dazed expression for an<lb>
instant, for she had been speaking the delightful language<lb>
of lips and eyes that lovers use, and the old<lb>
tongue sounded harsh to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is safe with her father, and is to marry the<lb>
`other one' next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; ejaculated Christie, so fervently<lb>
that David looked suddenly enlightened and<lb>
much amused, as he said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of Fletcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He 's safely out of the way, and I sincerely hope<lb>
<hi rend="italics">he</hi> will marry some `other one' as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie, you were jealous of that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, you were jealous of that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they both burst out laughing like two children,<lb>
for heavy burdens had been lifted off their hearts and<lb>
they were bubbling over with happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But truly, David, weren't you a little jealous of P.<lb>
F.?&rdquo; persisted Christie, feeling an intense desire to ask<lb>
all manner of harassing questions, with the agreeable<lb>
certainty that they would be fully answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desperately jealous. You were so kind, so gay, so<lb>
altogether charming when with him, that I could not<lb>
stand by and see it, so I kept away. Why were you<lb>
never so to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you never showed that you cared for me,<lb>
and <hi rend="italics">he</hi> did. But it was wrong in me to do it, and I<lb>
repent of it heartily; for it hurt him more than I thought<lb>
it would when the experiment failed. I truly tried to<lb>
love him, but I couldn't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet he had so much to offer, and could give you all<lb>
<pb n="350">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-361">

<figdesc>Page 350.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
you most enjoy. It is very singular that you failed to<lb>
care for him, and preferred a poor old fellow like me,&rdquo;<lb>
said David, beaming at her like a beatified man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do love luxury and pleasure, but I love independence<lb>
more. I 'm happier poking in the dirt with you<lb>
than I should be driving in a fine carriage with `that<lb>
piece of elegance' as Mr. Power called him; prouder<lb>
of being your wife than his; and none of the costly<lb>
things he offered me were half so precious in my sight<lb>
as your little nosegays, now mouldering away in my<lb>
treasure-box upstairs. Why, Davy, I 've longed more<lb>
intensely for the right to push up the curly lock that is<lb>
always tumbling into your eyes, than for Philip's whole<lb>
fortune. <hi rend="italics">May</hi> I do it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; and Christie did it with a tender satisfaction<lb>
that made David love her the more, though he<lb>
laughed like a boy at the womanly whim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you thought I cared for Kitty?&rdquo; he said<lb>
presently, taking his turn at the new game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I help it when she was so young and<lb>
pretty and fond of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she?&rdquo; innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn't you see it? How blind men are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, did you see that <hi rend="italics">I</hi> cared for you?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Christie, turning crimson under the significant glance he<lb>
gave her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had; I confess I once or twice fancied that<lb>
I caught glimpses of bliss round the corner, as it were;<lb>
but, before I could decide, the glimpses vanished, and I<lb>
was very sure I was a conceited coxcomb to think it<lb>
for a moment. It was very hard, and yet I was glad.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="351">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-362">

<figdesc>Page 351.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because I had made a sort of vow that I 'd<lb>
never love or marry as a punishment for my cruelty to<lb>
Letty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was wrong, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it now; but it was not hard to keep that foolish<lb>
vow till you came; and you see I 've broken it<lb>
without a shadow of regret to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have done it months ago and saved me<lb>
so much woe if you had not been a dear, modest, morbidly<lb>
conscientious bat,&rdquo; sighed Christie, pleased and<lb>
proud to learn her power, yet sorry for the long<lb>
delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, love. You see I didn't find out why<lb>
I liked my friend so well till I lost her. I had just<lb>
begun to feel that you were very dear, &mdash; for after the<lb>
birthday you were like an angel in the house, Christie,&mdash;<lb>
when you changed all at once, and I thought you suspected<lb>
me, and didn't like it. Your running away when<lb>
Kitty came confirmed my fear; then in came that &mdash;<lb>
would you mind if I said &mdash; confounded Fletcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as he didn't win, I won't be hard on him;<lb>
but I gave up then and had a tough time of it; especially<lb>
that first night when this splendid lover appeared<lb>
and received such a kind welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie saw the strong hand that lay on David's<lb>
knee clenched slowly, as he knit his brows with a grim<lb>
look, plainly showing that he was not what she was<lb>
inclined to think him, a perfect saint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my heart! and there I was loving you so dearly<lb>
all the time, and you wouldn't see or speak or<lb>
<pb n="352">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-363">

<figdesc>Page 352.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
understand, but went away, left me to torment all three of<lb>
us,&rdquo; cried Christie with a tragic gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest girl, did you ever know a man in love<lb>
do, say, or think the right thing at the right time? <hi rend="italics">I</hi><lb>
never did,&rdquo; said David, so penitently that she forgave<lb>
him on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear. It has taught us the worth of<lb>
love, and perhaps we are the better for the seeming<lb>
waste of precious time. Now I've not only got you<lb>
but Letty also, and your mother is mine in very truth.<lb>
Ah, how rich I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought it was all over with me when I<lb>
found Letty, because, seeing no more of Fletcher, I<lb>
had begun to hope again, and when she came back<lb>
to me I knew my home must be hers, yet feared you<lb>
would refuse to share it if you knew all. You are<lb>
very proud, and the purest-hearted woman I ever<lb>
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I <hi rend="italics">had</hi> refused, you would have let me go and<lb>
held fast to Letty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for I owe her every thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have known me better, David. But I<lb>
don't refuse, and there is no need to choose between<lb>
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank heaven, and you, my Christie! Imagine<lb>
what I felt when Letty told me all you had been to<lb>
her. If any thing <hi rend="italics">could</hi> make me love you more than I<lb>
now do, it would be that! No, don't hide your face;<lb>
I like to see it blush and smile and turn to me confidingly,<lb>
as it has not done all these long months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Letty tell you what she had done for me?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Christie, looking more like a rose than ever Kitty<lb>
did.</p>
<pb n="353">

<milestn unit="collation" n="W">
<p>&ldquo;She told me every thing, and wished me to tell you<lb>
all her story, even the saddest part of it. I 'd better<lb>
do it now before you meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused as if the tale was hard to tell; but Christie<lb>
put her hand on his lips saying softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never tell it; let her past be as sacred as if she<lb>
were dead. She was my friend when I had no other:<lb>
she is my dear sister now, and nothing can ever change<lb>
the love between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had thought David's face beautiful with gratitude<lb>
when he told the happier portions of that history,<lb>
she found it doubly so when she spared him the recital<lb>
of its darkest chapter, and bade him &ldquo;leave the rest to<lb>
silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you will come home? Mother wants you,<lb>
Letty longs for you, and I have got and mean to keep<lb>
you all my life, God willing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd better die to-night and make a blessed end, for<lb>
so much happiness is hardly possible in a world of<lb>
woe,&rdquo; answered Christie to that fervent invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be married very soon, take a wedding<lb>
trip to any part of the world you like, and our honeymoon<lb>
will last for ever, Mrs. Sterling, Jr.,&rdquo; said David,<lb>
soaring away into the future with sublime disregard of<lb>
obstacles.</p>
<p>Before Christie could get her breath after that somewhat<lb>
startling announcement, Mr. Power appeared,<lb>
took in the situation at a glance, gave them a smile that<lb>
was a benediction, and said heartily as he offered a hand<lb>
to each:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I'm satisfied; I've watched and waited patiently,<lb>
and after many tribulations you have found<lb>

each other in good time;&rdquo; then with a meaning look<lb>
at Christie he added slyly: &ldquo;But David is `no hero'<lb>
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remembered the chat in the strawberry bed,<lb>
laughed, and colored brightly, as she answered with her<lb>
hand trustfully in David's, her eyes full of loving pride<lb>
and reverence lifted to his face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've seen both sides of the medal now, and found it<lb>
`sterling gold.' Hero or not I 'm content; for, though<lb>
he `loves his mother much,' there is room in his heart<lb>
for me too; his `old books' have given him something<lb>
better than learning, and he has convinced me that<lb>
`double flowers' <hi rend="italics">are</hi> loveliest and best.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>CHRISTIE'S return was a very happy one, and<lb>
could not well be otherwise with a mother, sister,<lb>
and lover to welcome her back. Her meeting with<lb>
Letty was indescribably tender, and the days that followed<lb>
were pretty equally divided between her and her<lb>
brother, in nursing the one and loving the other.<lb>
There was no cloud now in Christie's sky, and all the<lb>
world seemed in bloom. But even while she enjoyed<lb>
every hour of life, and begrudged the time given to<lb>
sleep, she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last,<lb>
and often said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something will happen: such perfect happiness is<lb>
not possible in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us make the most of it,&rdquo; David would<lb>
reply, wisely bent on getting his honey while he could,<lb>
and not borrowing trouble for the morrow.</p>
<p>So Christie turned a deaf ear to her &ldquo;prophetic<lb>
soul,&rdquo; and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that<lb>
had come at last. Even while March winds were howling<lb>
outside, she blissfully &ldquo;poked in the dirt&rdquo; with<lb>
David in the green-house, put up the curly lock as<lb>
often as she liked, and told him she loved him a dozen<lb>
<pb n="356">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-367">

<figdesc>Page 356.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
times a day, not in words, but in silent ways, that<lb>
touched him to the heart, and made his future look so<lb>
bright he hardly dared believe in it.</p>
<p>A happier man it would have been difficult to find<lb>
just then; all his burdens seemed to have fallen off,<lb>
and his spirits rose again with an elasticity which surprised<lb>
even those who knew him best. Christie often<lb>
stopped to watch and wonder if the blithe young man<lb>
who went whistling and singing about the house, often<lb>
stopping to kiss somebody, to joke, or to exclaim with<lb>
a beaming face like a child at a party: &ldquo;Isn't every<lb>
thing beautiful?&rdquo; could be the sober, steady David,<lb>
who used to plod to and fro with his shoulders a little<lb>
bent, and the absent look in his eyes that told of<lb>
thoughts above or beyond the daily task.</p>
<p>It was good to see his mother rejoice over him with<lb>
an exceeding great joy; it was better still to see Letty's<lb>
eyes follow him with unspeakable love and gratitude in<lb>
their soft depths; but it was best of all to see Christie<lb>
marvel and exult over the discoveries she made: for,<lb>
though she had known David for a year, she had never<lb>
seen the real man till now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davy, you are a humbug,&rdquo; she said one day when<lb>
they were making up a bridal order in the green-house.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so, but you wouldn't believe it,&rdquo; he answered,<lb>
using long stemmed rose-buds with as prodigal<lb>
a hand as if the wedding was to be his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was going to marry a quiet, studious,<lb>
steady-going man; and here I find myself engaged to<lb>
a romantic youth who flies about in the most undignified<lb>
manner, embraces people behind doors, sings opera<lb>
<pb n="357">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-368">

<figdesc>Page 357.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
airs, &mdash; very much out of tune by the way, &mdash; and conducts<lb>
himself more like an infatuated Claude Melnotte,<lb>
than a respectable gentleman on the awful verge of<lb>
matrimony. Nothing can surprise me now: I 'm prepared<lb>
for any thing, even the sight of my Quakerish<lb>
lover dancing a jig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I 've been longing to do! Come and<lb>
take a turn: it will do you good;&rdquo; and, to Christie's<lb>
utter amazement, David caught her round the waist<lb>
and waltzed her down the boarded walk with a speed<lb>
and skill that caused less havoc among the flower-pots<lb>
than one would imagine, and seemed to delight the<lb>
plants, who rustled and nodded as if applauding the<lb>
dance of the finest double flower that had ever blossomed<lb>
in their midst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't help it, Christie,&rdquo; he said, when he had<lb>
landed her breathless and laughing at the other end.<lb>
&ldquo;I feel like a boy out of school, or rather a man out of<lb>
prison, and <hi rend="italics">must</hi> enjoy my liberty in some way. I 'm<lb>
not a talker, you know; and, as the laws of gravitation<lb>
forbid my soaring aloft anywhere, I can only express<lb>
my joyfully uplifted state of mind by `prancing,' as<lb>
you call it. Never mind dignity: let 's be happy, and<lb>
by and by I 'll sober down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't want you to; I love to see you so young<lb>
and happy, only you are not the old David, and I 've<lb>
got to get acquainted with the new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you 'll like him better than the frost-bitten<lb>
`old David' you first knew and were kind enough to<lb>
love. Mother says I 've gone back to the time before<lb>
we lost Letty, and I sometimes feel as if I had. In<lb>
that case you will find me a proud, impetuous, ambitious<lb>
fellow, Christie, and how will that suit?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="358">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-369">

<figdesc>Page 358.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellently; I like pride of your sort; impetuosity<lb>
becomes you, for you have learned to control it if need<lb>
be; and the ambition is best of all. I always wondered<lb>
at your want of it, and longed to stir you up;<lb>
for you did not seem the sort of man to be contented<lb>
with mere creature comforts when there are so many<lb>
fine things men may do. What shall you choose,<lb>
Davy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall wait for time to show. The sap is all astir<lb>
in me, and I 'm ready for my chance. I don't know<lb>
what it is, but I feel very sure that some work will be<lb>
given me into which I can put my whole heart and<lb>
soul and strength. I spoilt my first chance; but I know<lb>
I shall have another, and, whatever it is, I am ready to<lb>
do my best, and live or die for it as God wills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; answered Christie, with a voice as earnest<lb>
and a face as full of hopeful resolution as his own.</p>
<p>Then they went back to their work, little dreaming<lb>
as they tied roses and twined smilax wreaths, how near<lb>
that other chance was; how soon they were to be called<lb>
upon to keep their promise, and how well each was to<lb>
perform the part given them in life and death.</p>
<p>The gun fired one April morning at Fort Sumter<lb>
told many men like David what their work was to be,<lb>
and showed many women like Christie a new right to<lb>
claim and bravely prove their fitness to possess.</p>
<p>No need to repeat the story of the war begun that<lb>
day; it has been so often told that it will only be<lb>
touched upon here as one of the experiences of Christie's<lb>
life, an experience which did for her what it did<lb>
for all who took a share in it, and loyally acted their<lb>
part.</p>
<pb n="359">

<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-370">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>The North woke up from its prosperous lethargy, and<lb>
began to stir with the ominous hum of bees when rude<lb>
hands shake the hive. Rich and poor were proud to<lb>
prove that they loved their liberty better than their<lb>
money or their lives, and the descendants of the brave<lb>
old Puritans were worthy of their race. Many said: &ldquo;It<lb>
will soon be over;&rdquo; but the wise men, who had warned<lb>
in vain, shook their heads, as that first disastrous summer<lb>
showed that the time for compromise was past, and<lb>
the stern reckoning day of eternal justice was at<lb>
hand.</p>
<p>To no home in the land did the great trouble bring<lb>
a more sudden change than the little cottage in the<lb>
lane. All its happy peace was broken; excitement<lb>
and anxiety, grief and indignation, banished the sweet<lb>
home joys and darkened the future that had seemed so<lb>
clear. David was sober enough now, and went about his<lb>
work with a grim set to his lips, and a spark in his eyes<lb>
that made the three women look at one another pale<lb>
with unspoken apprehension. As they sat together,<lb>
picking lint or rolling bandages while David read<lb>
aloud some dismal tale of a lost battle that chilled<lb>
their blood and made their hearts ache with pity, each<lb>
woman, listening to the voice that stirred her like martial<lb>
music, said within herself: &ldquo;Sooner or later he<lb>
will go, and I have no right to keep him.&rdquo; Each tried<lb>
to be ready to make her sacrifice bravely when the<lb>
time came, and each prayed that it might not be<lb>
required of her.</p>
<p>David said little, but they knew by the way he<lb>
neglected his garden and worked for the soldiers, that<lb>
his heart was in the war. Day after day he left<lb>
<pb n="360">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-371">

<figdesc>Page 360.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Christie and his sister to fill the orders that came so often<lb>
now for flowers to lay on the grave of some dear, dead<lb>
boy brought home to his mother in a shroud. Day after<lb>
day he hurried away to help Mr. Power in the sanitary<lb>
work that soon claimed all hearts and hands; and,<lb>
day after day, he came home with what Christie called<lb>
the &ldquo;heroic look&rdquo; more plainly written on his face.<lb>
All that first summer, so short and strange; all that<lb>
first winter, so long and hard to those who went and<lb>
those who stayed, David worked and waited, and the<lb>
women waxed strong in the new atmosphere of selfsacrifice<lb>
which pervaded the air, bringing out the sturdy<lb>
virtues of the North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible! Oh, when will it be over!&rdquo; sighed<lb>
Letty one day, after hearing a long list of the dead<lb>
and wounded in one of the great battles of that second<lb>
summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never till we have beaten!&rdquo; cried David, throwing<lb>
down the paper and walking about the room with his<lb>
head up like a war-horse who smells powder. &ldquo;It <hi rend="italics">is</hi><lb>
terrible and yet glorious. I thank heaven I live to see<lb>
this great wrong righted, and only wish I could do my<lb>
share like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is natural; but there are plenty of men who<lb>
have fewer ties than you, who can fight better, and<lb>
whose places are easier to fill than yours if they die,&rdquo;<lb>
said Christie, hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the men who have most to lose fight best they<lb>
say; and to my thinking a soldier needs a principle as<lb>
well as a weapon, if he is to do real service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the only son of a widow, you can't be drafted:<lb>
that 's one comfort,&rdquo; said Letty, who could not bear to<lb>
give up the brother lost to her for so many years.</p>
<pb n="361">

<milestn unit="collation" n="16">
<p>&ldquo;I should not wait for that, and I know mother<lb>
would give her widow's mite if she saw that it was<lb>
needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Davy.&rdquo; The soft, old voice answered steadily;<lb>
but the feeble hand closed instinctively on the arm of<lb>
this only son, who was so dear to her. David held it<lb>
close in both of his, saying gratefully: &ldquo;Thank you,<lb>
mother;&rdquo; then, fixing his eyes on the younger yet not<lb>
dearer women, he added with a ring in his voice that<lb>
made their hearts answer with a prompt &ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo;<lb>
in spite of love or fear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, you dear souls, and understand that, if<lb>
I do this thing, I shall not do it hastily, nor without<lb>
counting well the cost. My first and most natural impulse<lb>
was to go in the beginning; but I stayed for<lb>
your sakes. I saw I was not really needed: I thought<lb>
the war would soon be over, and those who went then<lb>
could do the work. You see how mistaken we were,<lb>
and God only knows when the end will come. The<lb>
boys &mdash; bless their brave hearts! &mdash; have done nobly,<lb>
but older men are needed now. We cannot sacrifice all<lb>
the gallant lads; and we who have more to lose than<lb>
they must take our turn and try to do as well. You<lb>
own this; I see it in your faces: then don't hold me<lb>
back when the time comes for me to go. I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> do<lb>
my part, however small it is, or I shall never feel as if<lb>
I deserved the love you give me. You will let me go,<lb>
I am sure, and not regret that I did what seemed to<lb>
me a solemn duty, leaving the consequences to the<lb>
Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, David,&rdquo; sister and sweetheart answered,<lb>
<pb n="362">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-373">

<figdesc>Page 362.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what<lb>
heavy consequences God might see fit to send.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I knew my Spartans would be ready, and<lb>
I won't disgrace them. I 've waited more than a year,<lb>
and done what I could. But all the while I felt<lb>
that I was going to get a chance at the hard work, and<lb>
I 've been preparing for it. Bennet will take the garden<lb>
and green-house off my hands this autumn for a year<lb>
or longer, if I like. He 's a kind, neighborly man, and<lb>
his boy will take my place about the house and protect<lb>
you faithfully. Mr. Power cannot be spared to go as<lb>
chaplain, though he longs to desperately; so he is near<lb>
in case of need, and with your two devoted daughters<lb>
by you, mother, I surely can be spared for a little<lb>
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one daughter near her, David: I shall enlist<lb>
when you do,&rdquo; said Christie, resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it as honestly as you do. I knew you would<lb>
go: I saw you getting ready, and I made up my mind<lb>
to follow. I, too, have prepared for it, and even spoken<lb>
to Mrs. Amory. She has gone as matron of a hospital,<lb>
and promised to find a place for me when I was ready.<lb>
The day you enlist I shall write and tell her I <hi rend="italics">am</hi><lb>
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was fire in Christie's eyes and a flush on her<lb>
cheek now, as she stood up with the look of a woman<lb>
bent on doing well her part. David caught her hands<lb>
in his, regardless of the ominous bandages they held,<lb>
and said, with tender admiration and reproach in his<lb>
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn't marry me when I asked you this<lb>
<pb n="363">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-374">

<figdesc>Page 363.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
summer, fearing you would be a burden to me; but<lb>
now you want to share hardship and danger with me,<lb>
and support me by the knowledge of your nearness.<lb>
Dear, ought I to let you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <hi rend="italics">will</hi> let me do it, and in return I will marry<lb>
you whenever you ask me,&rdquo; answered Christie, sealing<lb>
the promise with a kiss that silenced him.</p>
<p>He had been anxious to be married long ago, but<lb>
when he asked Mr. Power to make him happy, a month<lb>
after his engagement, that wise friend said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't advise it yet. You have tried and proved<lb>
one another as friends, now try and prove one another<lb>
as lovers; then, if you feel that all is safe and happy,<lb>
you will be ready for the greatest of the three experiments,<lb>
and then in God's name marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; they said, and for a year had been content,<lb>
studying one another, finding much to love, and<lb>
something to learn in the art of bearing and forbearing.</p>
<p>David had begun to think they had waited long<lb>
enough, but Christie still delayed, fearing she was not<lb>
worthy, and secretly afflicted by the thought of her<lb>
poverty. She had so little to give in return for all she<lb>
received that it troubled her, and she was sometimes<lb>
tempted to ask Uncle Enos for a modest marriage portion.<lb>
She never had yet, and now resolved to ask<lb>
nothing, but to earn her blessing by doing her share in<lb>
the great work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall remember that,&rdquo; was all David answered to<lb>
that last promise of hers, and three months later he<lb>
took her at her word.</p>
<p>For a week or two they went on in the old way;<lb>
Christie did her housework with her head full of new<lb>
<pb n="364">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-375">

<figdesc>Page 364.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
plans, read books on nursing, made gruel, plasters, and<lb>
poultices, till Mrs. Sterling pronounced her perfect; and<lb>
dreamed dreams of a happy time to come when peace<lb>
had returned, and David was safe at home with all the<lb>
stars and bars a man could win without dying for them.</p>
<p>David set things in order, conferred with Bennet,<lb>
petted his womankind, and then hurried away to pack<lb>
boxes of stores, visit camps, and watch departing regiments<lb>
with a daily increasing certainty that his time<lb>
had come.</p>
<p>One September day he went slowly home, and, seeing<lb>
Christie in the garden, joined her, helped her finish matting<lb>
up some delicate shrubs, put by the tools, and<lb>
when all was done said with unusual gentleness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and walk a little in the lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her arm in his, and answered quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You 've something to tell me: I see it in your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Christie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all: she did not offer to detain him now;<lb>
he did not deny her right to follow. They looked each<lb>
other bravely in the face a moment, seeing, acknowledging<lb>
the duty and the danger, yet ready to do the one<lb>
and dare the other, since they went together. Then<lb>
shoulder to shoulder, as if already mustered in, these<lb>
faithful comrades marched to and fro, planning their<lb>
campaign.</p>
<p>Next evening, as Mrs. Sterling sat alone in the twilight,<lb>
a tall man in army blue entered quietly, stood<lb>
<pb n="365">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-376">

<figdesc>Page 365.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
watching the tranquil figure for a moment, then went<lb>
and knelt down beside it, saying, with a most unsoldierly<lb>
choke in the voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 've done it, mother: tell me you 're not sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the little Quaker cap went down on the broad<lb>
shoulder, and the only answer he heard was a sob that<lb>
stirred the soft folds over the tender old heart that<lb>
clung so closely to the son who had lived for her so<lb>
long. What happened in the twilight no one ever<lb>
knew; but David received promotion for bravery in a<lb>
harder battle than any he was going to, and from his<lb>
mother's breast a decoration more precious to him than<lb>
the cross of the Legion of Honor from a royal hand.</p>
<p>When Mr. Power presently came in, followed by the<lb>
others, they found their soldier standing very erect in<lb>
his old place on the rug, with the firelight gleaming on<lb>
his bright buttons, and Bran staring at him with a<lb>
perplexed aspect; for the uniform, shorn hair, trimmed<lb>
beard, and a certain lofty carriage of the head so<lb>
changed his master that the sagacious beast was disturbed.<lb>
</p>
<p>Letty smiled at him approvingly, then went to comfort<lb>
her mother who could not recover her tranquillity<lb>
so soon. But Christie stood aloof, looking at her lover<lb>
with something more than admiration in the face that<lb>
kindled beautifully as she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O David, you are splendid! Once I was so blind<lb>
I thought you plain; but now my `boy in blue' is the<lb>
noblest looking man I ever saw. Yes, Mr. Power, I 've<lb>
found my hero at last! Here he is, my knight without<lb>
reproach or fear, going out to take his part in the<lb>
grandest battle ever fought. I wouldn't keep him if I<lb>
<pb n="366">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-377">

<figdesc>Page 366.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
could; I 'm glad and proud to have him go; and if he<lb>
never should come back to me I can bear it better for<lb>
knowing that he dutifully did his best, and left the<lb>
consequences to the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having poured out the love and pride and confidence<lb>
that enriched her sacrifice, she broke down and<lb>
clung to him, weeping as so many clung and wept in<lb>
those hard days when men and women gave their dearest,<lb>
and those who prayed and waited suffered almost<lb>
as much as those who fought and died.</p>
<p>When the deed was once done, it was astonishing<lb>
what satisfaction they all took in it, how soon they got<lb>
accustomed to the change, and what pride they felt in<lb>
&ldquo;our soldier.&rdquo; The loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet<lb>
women, and they could not do too much for their<lb>
country. Mrs. Sterling cut up her treasured old linen<lb>
without a murmur; Letty made &ldquo;comfort bags&rdquo; by the<lb>
dozen, put up jelly, and sewed on blue jackets with<lb>
tireless industry; while Christie proclaimed that if she<lb>
had twenty lovers she would send them all; and then<lb>
made preparations enough to nurse the entire party.</p>
<p>David meantime was in camp, getting his first taste of<lb>
martial life, and not liking it any better than he thought<lb>
he should; but no one heard a complaint, and he never<lb>
regretted his &ldquo;love among the roses,&rdquo; for he was one<lb>
of the men who had a &ldquo;principle as well as a weapon,&rdquo;<lb>
and meant to do good service with both.</p>
<p>It would have taken many knapsacks to hold all the<lb>
gifts showered upon him by his friends and neighbors.<lb>
He accepted all that came, and furnished forth those of<lb>
his company who were less favored. Among these was<lb>
Elisha Wilkins, and how he got there should be told.</p>
<pb n="367">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-378">

<figdesc>Page 367.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>Elisha had not the slightest intention of enlisting,<lb>
but Mrs. Wilkins was a loyal soul, and could not rest<lb>
till she had sent a substitute, since she could not go<lb>
herself. Finding that Lisha showed little enthusiasm<lb>
on the subject, she tried to rouse him by patriotic<lb>
appeals of various sorts. She read stirring accounts of<lb>
battles, carefully omitting the dead and wounded; she<lb>
turned out, baby and all if possible, to cheer every<lb>
regiment that left; and was never tired of telling Wash<lb>
how she wished she could add ten years to his age and<lb>
send him off to fight for his country like a man.</p>
<p>But nothing seemed to rouse the supine Elisha, who<lb>
chewed his quid like a placid beast of the field, and<lb>
showed no sign of a proper spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins resolutely to herself,<lb>
&ldquo;ef I can't make no impression on his soul I will on his<lb>
stommick, and see how that 'll work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which threat she carried out with such skill and<lb>
force that Lisha was effectually waked up, for he <hi rend="italics">was</hi><lb>
&ldquo;partial to good vittles,&rdquo; and Cynthy was a capital<lb>
cook. Poor rations did not suit him, and he demanded<lb>
why his favorite dishes were not forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can't afford no nice vittles now when our men<lb>
are sufferin' so. I should be ashamed to cook 'em, and<lb>
expect to choke tryin' to eat 'em. Every one is sacrificin'<lb>
somethin', and we mustn't be slack in doin' our<lb>
part, &mdash; the Lord knows it 's precious little, &mdash; and there<lb>
won't be no stuffin' in this house for a consid'able spell.<lb>
Ef I <hi rend="italics">could</hi> save up enough to send a man to do my<lb>
share of the fightin', I should be proud to do it. Anyway<lb>
I shall stint the family and send them dear brave<lb>
fellers every cent I can git without starvin' the children.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<pb n="368">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-379">

<figdesc>Page 368.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cynthy, don't be ferce. Things will come<lb>
out all right, and it ain't no use upsettin' every thing<lb>
and bein' so darned uncomfortable,&rdquo; answered Mr. Wilkins<lb>
with unusual energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it is, Lisha. No one has a right to be comfortable<lb>
in such times as these, and <hi rend="italics">this</hi> family ain't goin'<lb>
to be ef I can help it,&rdquo; and Mrs. Wilkins set down her<lb>
flat-iron with a slam which plainly told her Lisha war<lb>
was declared.</p>
<p>He said no more but fell a thinking. He was not as<lb>
unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement, and<lb>
had felt sundry manly impulses to &ldquo;up and at 'em,&rdquo;<lb>
when his comrades in the shop discussed the crisis with<lb>
ireful brandishing of awls, and vengeful pounding of<lb>
sole leather, as if the rebels were under the hammer.<lb>
But the selfish, slothful little man could not make up<lb>
his mind to brave hardship and danger, and fell back<lb>
on his duty to his family as a reason for keeping safe at<lb>
home.</p>
<p>But now that home was no longer comfortable, now<lb>
that Cynthy had sharpened her tongue, and turned<lb>
&ldquo;ferce,&rdquo; and now &mdash; hardest blow of all &mdash; that he was<lb>
kept on short commons, he began to think he might as<lb>
well be on the tented field, and get a little glory along<lb>
with the discomfort if that was inevitable. Nature<lb>
abhors a vacuum, and when food fell short patriotism<lb>
had a chance to fill the aching void. Lisha had about<lb>
made up his mind, for he knew the value of peace and<lb>
quietness; and, though his wife was no scold, she was<lb>
the ruling power, and in his secret soul he considered<lb>
her a very remarkable woman. He knew what she<lb>
wanted, but was not going to be hurried for anybody;<lb>
<pb n="369">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-380">

<figdesc>Page 369.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="16* X">
so he still kept silent, and Mrs. Wilkins began to think<lb>
she must give it up. An unexpected ally appeared<lb>
however, and the good woman took advantage of it to<lb>
strike one last blow.</p>
<p>Lisha sat eating a late breakfast one morning, with a<lb>
small son at either elbow, waiting for stray mouthfuls<lb>
and committing petty larcenies right and left, for Pa<lb>
was in a brown study. Mrs. Wilkins was frying flapjacks,<lb>
and though this is not considered an heroical employment<lb>
she made it so that day. This was a favorite<lb>
dish of Lisha's, and she had prepared it as a bait for<lb>
this cautious fish. To say that the fish rose at once<lb>
and swallowed the bait, hook and all, but feebly expresses<lb>
the justice done to the cakes by that long-suffering<lb>
man. Waiting till he had a tempting pile of the<lb>
lightest, brownest flapjacks ever seen upon his plate,<lb>
and was watching an extra big bit of butter melt luxuriously<lb>
into the warm bosom of the upper one, with a<lb>
face as benign as if some of the molasses he was trickling<lb>
over them had been absorbed into his nature,<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins seized the propitious moment to say impressively:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Sterlin' has enlisted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho! has he, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he has! any man with the spirit of a<lb>
muskeeter would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he ain't got a family, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He 's got his old mother, that sister home from<lb>
furrin' parts somewheres, and Christie just going to be<lb>
married. I should like to know who 's got a harder<lb>
family to leave than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six young children is harder: ef I went fifin' and<lb>
<pb n="370">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-381">

<figdesc>Page 370.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
drummin' off, who 'd take care of them I 'd like to<lb>
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess <hi rend="italics">I</hi> could support the family ef I give my<lb>
mind to it;&rdquo; and Mrs. Wilkins turned a flapjack with an<lb>
emphasis that caused her lord to bolt a hot triangle<lb>
with dangerous rapidity; for well he knew very little<lb>
of <hi rend="italics">his</hi> money went into the common purse. She never<lb>
reproached him, but the fact nettled him now; and<lb>
something in the tone of her voice made that sweet<lb>
morsel hard to swallow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Pears to me you 're in ruther a hurry to be a<lb>
widder, Cynthy, shovin' me off to git shot in this kind<lb>
of a way,&rdquo; growled Lisha, ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'd ruther be a brave man's widder than a coward's<lb>
wife, any day!&rdquo; cried the rebellious Cynthy: then she<lb>
relented, and softly slid two hot cakes into his plate;<lb>
adding, with her hand upon his shoulder, &ldquo;Lisha, dear,<lb>
I want to be proud of my husband as other women be<lb>
of theirs. Every one gives somethin', I 've only got<lb>
you, and I want to do my share, and do it hearty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back to her work, and Mr. Wilkins sat<lb>
thoughtfully stroking the curly heads beside him, while<lb>
the boys ravaged his plate, with no reproof, but a half<lb>
audible, &ldquo;My little chaps, my little chaps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought she had got him, and smiled to herself,<lb>
even while a great tear sputtered on the griddle at<lb>
those last words of his.</p>
<p>Imagine her dismay, when, having consumed the<lb>
bait, her fish gave signs of breaking the line, and<lb>
escaping after all; for Mr. Wilkins pushed back his<lb>
chair, and said slowly, as he filled his pipe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm blest ef I can see the sense of a lot of decent<lb>
<pb n="371">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-382">

<figdesc>Page 371.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
men going off to be froze, and starved, and blowed up<lb>
jest for them confounded niggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further, for his wife's patience gave out;<lb>
and, leaving her cakes to burn black, she turned to him<lb>
with a face glowing like her stove, and cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lisha, ain't you got no heart? can you remember<lb>
what Hepsey told us, and call them poor, long-sufferin'<lb>
creeters names? Can you think of them wretched<lb>
wives sold from their husbands; them children as dear<lb>
as ourn tore from their mothers; and old folks kep<lb>
slavin eighty long, hard years with no pay, no help, no<lb>
pity, when they git past work? Lisha Wilkins, look at<lb>
<hi rend="italics">that,</hi> and say no ef you darst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins was a homely woman in an old calico<lb>
gown, but her face, her voice, her attitude were grand,<lb>
as she flung wide the door of the little back bedroom,<lb>
and pointed with her tin spatula to the sight beyond.</p>
<p>Only Hepsey sitting by a bed where lay what looked<lb>
more like a shrivelled mummy than a woman. Ah!<lb>
but it was that old mother worked and waited for so<lb>
long: blind now, and deaf; childish, and half dead with<lb>
many hardships, but safe and free at last; and Hepsey's<lb>
black face was full of a pride, a peace, and happiness<lb>
more eloquent and touching than any speech or sermon<lb>
ever uttered.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins had heard her story, and been more<lb>
affected by it than he would confess: now it came<lb>
home to him with sudden force; the thought of his<lb>
own mother, wife, or babies torn from him stirred him<lb>
to the heart, and the manliest emotion he had ever<lb>
known caused him to cast his pipe at his feet, put on<lb>
his hat with an energetic slap, and walk out of the<lb>
<pb n="372">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-383">

<figdesc>Page 372.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
house, wearing an expression on his usually wooden face<lb>
that caused his wife to clap her hands and cry exultingly:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that would fetch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she fell to work like an inspired woman; and<lb>
at noon a sumptuous dinner &ldquo;smoked upon the board;&rdquo;<lb>
the children were scrubbed till their faces shone; and<lb>
the room was as fresh and neat as any apartment could<lb>
be with the penetrating perfume of burnt flapjacks still<lb>
pervading the air, and three dozen ruffled nightcaps<lb>
decorating the clothes-lines overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the instant minute you see Pa a comin', and<lb>
I 'll dish up the gravy,&rdquo; was Mrs. Wilkins's command, as<lb>
she stepped in with a cup of tea for old &ldquo;Marm,&rdquo; as<lb>
she called Hepsey's mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He 's a comin', Ma!&rdquo; called Gusty, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he ain't: it 's a trainer,&rdquo; added Ann Lizy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, 'tis Pa! oh, my eye! ain't he stunnin'!&rdquo; cried<lb>
Wash, stricken for the first time with admiration of his<lb>
sire.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Wilkins could reply to these conflicting<lb>
rumors her husband walked in, looking as martial as his<lb>
hollow chest and thin legs permitted, and, turning his<lb>
cap nervously in his hands, said half-proudly, half-reproachfully:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cynthy, <hi rend="italics">be</hi> you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Lisha! I be, I be!&rdquo; and the inconsistent<lb>
woman fell upon his buttony breast weeping copiously.<lb>
</p>
<p>If ever a man was praised and petted, admired and<lb>
caressed, it was Elisha Wilkins that day. His wife<lb>
fed him with the fat of the land, regardless of<lb>
<pb n="373">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-384">

<figdesc>Page 373.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
consequences; his children revolved about him with tireless<lb>
curiosity and wonder; his neighbors flocked in to applaud,<lb>
advise, and admire; every one treated him with<lb>
a respect most grateful to his feelings; he was an object<lb>
of interest, and with every hour his importance increased,<lb>
so that by night he felt like a Commander-in-Chief,<lb>
and bore himself accordingly. He had enlisted<lb>
in David's regiment, which was a great comfort to his<lb>
wife; for though her stout heart never failed her, it grew<lb>
very heavy at times; and when Lisha was gone, she<lb>
often dropped a private tear over the broken pipe that<lb>
always lay in its old place, and vented her emotions by<lb>
sending baskets of nourishment to Private Wilkins,<lb>
which caused that bandy-legged warrior to be much<lb>
envied and cherished by his mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm glad I done it; for it will make a man of<lb>
Lisha; and, if I 've sent him to his death, God knows<lb>
he 'll be fitter to die than if he stayed here idlin' his life<lb>
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the good soul openly shouldered the burden<lb>
she had borne so long in secret, and bravely trudged<lb>
on alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another great battle!&rdquo; screamed the excited newsboys<lb>
in the streets. &ldquo;Another great battle!&rdquo; read<lb>
Letty in the cottage parlor. &ldquo;Another great battle!&rdquo;<lb>
cried David, coming in with the war-horse expression<lb>
on his face a month or two after he enlisted.</p>
<p>The women dropped their work to look and listen;<lb>
for his visits were few and short, and every instant was<lb>
precious. When the first greetings were over, David<lb>
stood silent an instant, and a sudden mist came over his<lb>
eyes as he glanced from one beloved face to another;<lb>
<pb n="374">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-385">

<figdesc>Page 374.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
then he threw back his head with the old impatient<lb>
gesture, squared his shoulders, and said in a loud, cheerful<lb>
voice, with a suspicious undertone of emotion in it,<lb>
however:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My precious people, I 've got something to tell you:<lb>
are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They knew what it was without a word. Mrs. Sterling<lb>
clasped her hands and bowed her head. Letty<lb>
turned pale and dropped her work; but Christie's eyes<lb>
kindled, as she answered with a salute:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, my General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ordered off at once, and go at four this<lb>
afternoon. I 've got a three hours' leave to say good-by<lb>
in. Now, let 's be brave and enjoy every minute<lb>
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will: what can I do for you, Davy?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Christie, wonderfully supported by the thought that<lb>
she was going too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your promise, dear,&rdquo; he answered, while the<lb>
warlike expression changed to one of infinite tenderness.<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This;&rdquo; and he held out his hand with a little<lb>
paper in it. She saw it was a marriage license, and on<lb>
it lay a wedding-ring. She did not hesitate an instant,<lb>
but laid her own hand in his, and answered with her<lb>
heart in her face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll keep it, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would!&rdquo; then holding her close he said<lb>
in a tone that made it very hard for her to keep steady,<lb>
as she had vowed she would do to the last: &ldquo;I know<lb>
it is much to ask, but I want to feel that you are mine<lb>
<pb n="375">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-386">

<figdesc>Page 375.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
before I go. Not only that, but it will be a help and<lb>
protection to you, dear, when you follow. As a married<lb>
woman you will get on better, as my wife you will be<lb>
allowed to come to me if I need you, and as my&rdquo; &mdash;<lb>
he stopped there, for he could not add &mdash; &ldquo;as my widow<lb>
you will have my pension to support you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She understood, put both arms about his neck as if<lb>
to keep him safe, and whispered fervently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can part us any more, not even death; for<lb>
love like ours will last for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are quite willing to try the third great<lb>
experiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad and proud to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With no doubt, no fear, to mar your consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's true love, Christie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they stood quite still for a time, and in the<lb>
silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet<lb>
language no tongue can utter. Presently David said<lb>
regretfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant it should be so different. I always planned<lb>
that we 'd be married some bright summer day, with<lb>
many friends about us; then take a happy little journey<lb>
somewhere together, and come back to settle down at<lb>
home in the dear old way. Now it 's all so hurried,<lb>
sorrowful, and strange. A dull November day; no<lb>
friends but Mr. Power, who will be here soon; no journey<lb>
but my march to Washington alone; and no happy<lb>
coming home together in this world perhaps. Can you<lb>
bear it, love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear for me: I feel as if I could bear any<lb>
thing just now; for I 've got into a heroic mood and I<lb>
<pb n="376">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-387">

<figdesc>Page 376.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
mean to keep so as long as I can. I 've always wanted<lb>
to live in stirring times, to have a part in great deeds,<lb>
to sacrifice and suffer something for a principle or a<lb>
person; and now I have my wish. I like it, David:<lb>
it 's a grand time to live, a splendid chance to do and<lb>
suffer; and I want to be in it heart and soul, and earn a<lb>
little of the glory or the martyrdom that will come in<lb>
the end. Surely I shall if I give you and myself to<lb>
the cause; and I do it gladly, though I know that my<lb>
heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet, when<lb>
my courage fails, as it will by and by, and my selfish<lb>
soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement<lb>
is over. Help me to be brave and strong, David: don't<lb>
let me complain or regret, but show me what lies beyond,<lb>
and teach me to believe that simply doing the<lb>
right is reward and happiness enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie was lifted out of herself for the moment,<lb>
and looked inspired by the high mood which was but<lb>
the beginning of a nobler life for her. David caught<lb>
the exaltation, and gave no further thought to any thing<lb>
but the duty of the hour, finding himself stronger and<lb>
braver for that long look into the illuminated face of<lb>
the woman he loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll try,&rdquo; was all his answer to her appeal; then<lb>
proved that he meant it by adding, with his lips against<lb>
her cheek: &ldquo;I must go to mother and Letty. We<lb>
leave them behind, and they must be comforted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went, and Christie vanished to make ready for<lb>
her wedding, conscious, in spite of her exalted state of<lb>
mind, that every thing <hi rend="italics">was</hi> very hurried, sad, and<lb>
strange, and very different from the happy day she had<lb>
so often planned.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter, we are `well on't for love,' and that is<lb>
all we really need,&rdquo; she thought, recalling with a smile<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins's advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David sends you these, dear. Can I help in any<lb>
way?&rdquo; asked Letty, coming with a cluster of lovely<lb>
white roses in her hand, and a world of affection in her<lb>
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he 'd give me violets,&rdquo; and a shadow<lb>
came over Christie's face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are mourning flowers, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me. The roses are, for they remind me of<lb>
poor Helen, and the first work I did with David was<lb>
arranging flowers like these for a dead baby's little<lb>
coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest Christie, don't be superstitious: all<lb>
brides wear roses, and Davy thought you 'd like them,&rdquo;<lb>
said Letty, troubled at her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I 'll wear them, and I won't have fancies if I<lb>
can help it. But I think few brides dress with a braver,<lb>
happier heart than mine, though I do choose a sober<lb>
wedding-gown,&rdquo; answered Christie, smiling again, as<lb>
she took from a half-packed trunk her new hospital suit<lb>
of soft, gray, woollen stuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won't you wear the pretty silvery silk we like so<lb>
well?&rdquo; asked Letty timidly, for something in Christie's<lb>
face and manner impressed her very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will be married in my uniform as David is,&rdquo;<lb>
she answered with a look Letty long remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power has come,&rdquo; she said softly a few minutes<lb>
later, with an anxious glance at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go dear, I 'll come directly. But first&rdquo; &mdash; and<lb>
Christie held her friend close a moment, kissed her<lb>
<pb n="378">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-389">

<figdesc>Page 378.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
tenderly, and whispered in a broken voice: &ldquo;Remember, I<lb>
don't take his heart from you, I only share it with my<lb>
sister and my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm glad to give him to you, Christie; for now I<lb>
feel as if I had partly paid the great debt I 've owed so<lb>
long,&rdquo; answered Letty through her tears.</p>
<p>Then she went away, and Christie soon followed,<lb>
looking very like a Quaker bride in her gray gown with<lb>
no ornament but delicate frills at neck and wrist, and<lb>
the roses in her bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bridal white, dear?&rdquo; said David, going to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; and she touched the flowers, adding<lb>
with her hand on the blue coat sleeve that embraced<lb>
her: &ldquo;I want to consecrate my uniform as you do<lb>
yours by being married in it. Isn't it fitter for a soldier's<lb>
wife than lace and silk at such a time as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much fitter: I like it; and I find you beautiful, my<lb>
Christie,&rdquo; whispered David, as she put one of her roses<lb>
in his button-hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I 'm satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power is waiting: are you ready, love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they were married, with Letty and her mother<lb>
standing beside them, Bennet and his wife dimly<lb>
visible in the door-way, and poor Bran at his master's<lb>
feet looking up with wistful eyes, half human in the<lb>
anxious affection they expressed.</p>
<p>Christie never forgot that service, so simple, sweet,<lb>
and solemn; nor the look her husband gave her at the<lb>
end, when he kissed her on lips and forehead, saying<lb>
fervently, &ldquo;God bless my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tender little scene followed that can better be<lb>

imagined than described; then Mr. Power said cheerily:<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hour more is all you have, so make the most<lb>
of it, dearly beloved. You young folks take a weddingtrip<lb>
to the green-house, while we see how well we can<lb>
get on without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David and Christie went smiling away together, and<lb>
<pb n="380">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-391">

<figdesc>Page 380.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one<lb>
saw them but the flowers, and they loyally kept the<lb>
secret folded up in their tender hearts.</p>
<p>Mr. Power cheered the old lady, while Letty, always<lb>
glad to serve, made ready the last meal David might<lb>
ever take at home.</p>
<p>A very simple little marriage feast, but more love,<lb>
good-will, and tender wishes adorned the plain table<lb>
than is often found at wedding breakfasts; and better<lb>
than any speech or song was Letty's broken whisper,<lb>
as she folded her arms round David's empty chair when<lb>
no one saw her, &ldquo;Heaven bless and keep and bring<lb>
him back to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How time went that day! The inexorable clock<lb>
<hi rend="italics">would</hi> strike twelve so soon, and then the minutes flew<lb>
till one was at hand, and the last words were still half<lb>
said, the last good-byes still unuttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> go!&rdquo; cried David with a sort of desperation,<lb>
as Letty clung to one arm, Christie to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see you soon: good-by, my husband,&rdquo; whispered<lb>
Christie, setting him free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give the last kiss to mother,&rdquo; added Letty, following<lb>
her example, and in another minute David was<lb>
gone.</p>
<p>At the turn of the lane, he looked back and swung<lb>
his cap; all waved their hands to him; and then he<lb>
marched away to the great work before him, leaving<lb>
those loving hearts to ask the unanswerable question:<lb>
&ldquo;How will he come home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie was going to town to see the regiment off,<lb>
and soon followed with Mr. Power. They went early<lb>
to a certain favorable spot, and there found Mrs.<lb>
<pb n="381">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-392">

<figdesc>Page 381.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Wilkins, with her entire family perched upon a fence, on<lb>
the spikes of which they impaled themselves at intervals,<lb>
and had to be plucked off by the stout girl engaged<lb>
to assist in this memorable expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lisha 's goin', and I was bound he should see<lb>
every one of his blessed children the last thing, ef I<lb>
took 'em all on my back. He knows where to look,<lb>
and he 's a goin' to see seven cheerful faces as he goes<lb>
by. Time enough to cry byme by; so set stiddy,<lb>
boys, and cheer loud when you see Pa,&rdquo; said Mrs.<lb>
Wilkins, fanning her hot face, and utterly forgetting<lb>
her cherished bonnet in the excitement of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear drums! They 're comin'!&rdquo; cried Wash, after<lb>
a long half hour's waiting had nearly driven him frantic.</p>
<p>The two younger boys immediately tumbled off the<lb>
fence, and were with difficulty restored to their perches.<lb>
Gusty began to cry, Ann Elizy to wave a minute red<lb>
cotton handkerchief, and Adelaide to kick delightedly<lb>
in her mother's arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane Carter, take this child for massy sake: my<lb>
legs do tremble so I can't h'ist her another minute.<lb>
Hold on to me behind, somebody, for I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> see ef<lb>
I do pitch into the gutter,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wilkins, with<lb>
a gasp, as she wiped her eyes on her shawl, clutched<lb>
the railing, and stood ready to cheer bravely when<lb>
her conquering hero came.</p>
<p>Wash had heard drums every five minutes since he<lb>
arrived, but this time he was right, and began to<lb>
cheer the instant a red cockade appeared at the other<lb>
end of the long street.</p>
<p>It was a different scene now than in the first enthusiastic,<lb>
hopeful days. Young men and ardent boys<lb>
<pb n="382">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-393">

<figdesc>Page 382.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
filled the ranks then, brave by instinct, burning with<lb>
loyal zeal, and blissfully ignorant of all that lay before<lb>
them.</p>
<p>Now the blue coats were worn by mature men,<lb>
some gray, all grave and resolute; husbands and fathers<lb>
with the memory of wives and children tugging at<lb>
their heart-strings; homes left desolate behind them,<lb>
and before them the grim certainty of danger, hardship,<lb>
and perhaps a captivity worse than death. Little<lb>
of the glamour of romance about the war now: they<lb>
saw what it was, a long, hard task; and here were<lb>
the men to do it well.</p>
<p>Even the lookers-on were different. Once all was<lb>
wild enthusiasm and glad uproar; now men's lips were<lb>
set, and women's smileless even as they cheered;<lb>
fewer handkerchiefs whitened the air, for wet eyes<lb>
needed them; and sudden lulls, almost solemn in their<lb>
stillness, followed the acclamations of the crowd. All<lb>
watched with quickened breath and proud souls that<lb>
living wave, blue below, and bright with a steely<lb>
glitter above, as it flowed down the street and away<lb>
to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for months<lb>
had rolled up against the South, and ebbed back reddened<lb>
with the blood of men like these.</p>
<p>As the inspiring music, the grand tramp drew near,<lb>
Christie felt the old thrill and longed to fall in and<lb>
follow the flag anywhere. Then she saw David, and<lb>
the regiment became one man to her. He was pale,<lb>
but his eyes shone, and his whole face expressed that<lb>
two of the best and bravest emotions of a man, love<lb>
and loyalty, were at their height as he gave his new-made<lb>
wife a long, lingering look that seemed to say:</p>

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,</l>
<l rend="indent">Loved I not honor more.&rdquo;</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Christie smiled and waved her hand to him, showed<lb>
him his wedding roses still on her breast, and bore<lb>
up as gallantly as he, resolved that his last impression<lb>
of her should be a cheerful one. But when it was<lb>
all over, and nothing remained but the trampled street,<lb>
the hurrying crowd, the bleak November sky, when<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins sat sobbing on the steps like Niobe with<lb>
her children scattered about her, then Christie's heart<lb>
gave way, and she hid her face on Mr. Power's shoulder<lb>
for a moment, all her ardor quenched in tears as she<lb>
cried within herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I could <hi rend="italics">not</hi> bear it if I was not going too!&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>TEN years earlier Christie made her <hi rend="italics">d&eacute;but</hi> as an<lb>
Amazon, now she had a braver part to play on a<lb>
larger stage, with a nation for audience, martial music<lb>
and the boom of cannon for orchestra; the glare of<lb>
battle-fields was the &ldquo;red light;&rdquo; danger, disease, and<lb>
death, the foes she was to contend against; and the<lb>
<hi rend="italics">troupe</hi> she joined, not timid girls, but high-hearted<lb>
women, who fought gallantly till the &ldquo;demon&rdquo; lay<lb>
dead, and sang their song of exultation with bleeding<lb>
hearts, for this great spectacle was a dire tragedy to<lb>
them.</p>
<p>Christie followed David in a week, and soon proved<lb>
herself so capable that Mrs. Amory rapidly promoted<lb>
her from one important post to another, and bestowed<lb>
upon her the only honors left the women, hard work,<lb>
responsibility, and the gratitude of many men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a treasure, my dear, for you can turn your<lb>
hand to any thing and do well whatever you undertake.<lb>
So many come with plenty of good-will, but not<lb>
a particle of practical ability, and are offended because<lb>
I decline their help. The boys don't want to be cried<lb>
over, or have their brows `everlastingly swabbed,' as<lb>
old Watkins calls it: they want to be well fed and<lb>

<milestn unit="collation" n="17 Y">
nursed, and cheered up with creature comforts. Your<lb>
nice beef-tea and cheery ways are worth oceans of<lb>
tears and cart-loads of tracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Amory said this, as Christie stood waiting while<lb>
she wrote an order for some extra delicacy for a very<lb>
sick patient. Mrs. Sterling, Jr., certainly did look like<lb>
an efficient nurse, who thought more of &ldquo;the boys&rdquo;<lb>
than of herself; for one hand bore a pitcher of gruel,<lb>
the other a bag of oranges, clean shirts hung over the<lb>
right arm, a rubber cushion under the left, and every<lb>
pocket in the big apron was full of bottles and bandages,<lb>
papers and letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never discovered what an accomplished woman I<lb>
was till I came here,&rdquo; answered Christie, laughing.<lb>
&ldquo;I 'm getting vain with so much praise, but I like it<lb>
immensely, and never was so pleased in my life as I<lb>
was yesterday when Dr. Harvey came for me to take<lb>
care of poor Dunbar, because no one else could manage<lb>
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's your firm yet pitiful way the men like so well.<lb>
I can't describe it better than in big Ben's words: `Mis<lb>
Sterlin' is the nuss for me, marm. She takes care of<lb>
me as ef she was my own mother, and it 's a comfort<lb>
jest to see her round.' It 's a gift, my dear, and you<lb>
may thank heaven you have got it, for it works wonders<lb>
in a place like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only treat the poor fellows as I would have other<lb>
women treat my David if he should be in their care.<lb>
He may be any hour, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my boys, God keep them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pen lay idle, and the gruel cooled, as young wife<lb>
and gray-haired mother forgot their duty for a moment<lb>
<pb n="386">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-397">

<figdesc>Page 386.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
in tender thoughts of the absent. Only a moment, for<lb>
in came an attendant with a troubled face, and an important<lb>
young surgeon with the well-worn little case<lb>
under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bartlett 's dying, marm: could you come and see to<lb>
him?&rdquo; says the man to Mrs. Amory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to amputate Porter's arm this morning,<lb>
and he won't consent unless you are with him. You<lb>
will come, of course?&rdquo; added the surgeon to Christie,<lb>
having tried and found her a woman with no &ldquo;confounded<lb>
nerves&rdquo; to impair her usefulness.</p>
<p>So matron and nurse go back to their duty, and<lb>
dying Bartlett and suffering Porter are all the more<lb>
tenderly served for that wasted minute.</p>
<p>Like David, Christie had enlisted for the war, and<lb>
in the two years that followed, she saw all sorts of<lb>
service; for Mrs. Amory had influence, and her right-hand<lb>
woman, after a few months' apprenticeship, was<lb>
ready for any post. The gray gown and comforting<lb>
face were known in many hospitals, seen on crowded<lb>
transports, among the ambulances at the front, invalid<lb>
cars, relief tents, and food depots up and down the<lb>
land, and many men went out of life like tired children<lb>
holding the hand that did its work so well.</p>
<p>David meanwhile was doing his part manfully, not<lb>
only in some of the great battles of those years, but<lb>
among the hardships, temptations, and sacrifices of a<lb>
soldiers' life. Spite of his Quaker ancestors, he was a<lb>
good fighter, and, better still, a magnanimous enemy,<lb>
hating slavery, but not the slave-holder, and often<lb>
spared the master while he saved the chattel. He was<lb>
soon promoted, and might have risen rapidly, but was<lb>
<pb n="387">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-398">

<figdesc>Page 387.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
content to remain as captain of his company; for his<lb>
men loved him, and he was prouder of his influence<lb>
over them than of any decoration he could win.</p>
<p>His was the sort of courage that keeps a man faithful<lb>
to death, and though he made no brilliant charge,<lb>
uttered few protestations of loyalty, and was never<lb>
heard to &ldquo;damn the rebs,&rdquo; his comrades felt that his<lb>
brave example had often kept them steady till a forlorn<lb>
hope turned into a victory, knew that all the wealth<lb>
of the world could not bribe him from his duty, and<lb>
learned of him to treat with respect an enemy as brave<lb>
and less fortunate than themselves. A noble nature<lb>
soon takes its proper rank and exerts its purifying influence,<lb>
and Private Sterling won confidence, affection, and<lb>
respect, long before promotion came; for, though he<lb>
had tended his flowers like a woman and loved his<lb>
books like a student, he now proved that he could also<lb>
do his duty and keep his honor stainless as a soldier<lb>
and a gentleman.</p>
<p>He and Christie met as often as the one could get a<lb>
brief furlough, or the other be spared from hospital<lb>
duty; but when these meetings did come, they were<lb>
wonderfully beautiful and rich, for into them was distilled<lb>
a concentration of the love, happiness, and communion<lb>
which many men and women only know<lb>
through years of wedded life.</p>
<p>Christie liked romance, and now she had it, with a<lb>
very sombre reality to give it an added charm. No<lb>
Juliet ever welcomed her Romeo more joyfully than<lb>
she welcomed David when he paid her a flying visit<lb>
unexpectedly; no Bayard ever had a more devoted<lb>
lady in his tent than David, when his wife came through<lb>
<pb n="388">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-399">

<figdesc>Page 388.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
every obstacle to bring him comforts or to nurse the<lb>
few wounds he received. Love-letters, written beside<lb>
watch-fires and sick-beds, flew to and fro like carrierdoves<lb>
with wondrous speed; and nowhere in all the<lb>
brave and busy land was there a fonder pair than this,<lb>
although their honeymoon was spent apart in camp and<lb>
hospital, and well they knew that there might never<lb>
be for them a happy going home together.</p>
<p>In her wanderings to and fro, Christie not only made<lb>
many new friends, but met some old ones; and among<lb>
these one whose unexpected appearance much surprised<lb>
and touched her.</p>
<p>She was &ldquo;scrabbling&rdquo; eggs in a tin basin on board a<lb>
crowded transport, going up the river with the echoes<lb>
of a battle dying away behind her, and before her the<lb>
prospect of passing the next day on a wharf serving<lb>
out food to the wounded in an easterly storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mrs. Sterling, do go up and see what 's to be<lb>
done! We are all full below, and more poor fellows<lb>
are lying about on deck in a dreadful state. I 'll take<lb>
your place here, but I can't stand that any longer,&rdquo; said<lb>
one of her aids, coming in heart-sick and exhausted by<lb>
the ghastly sights and terrible confusion of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll go: keep scrabbling while the eggs last, then<lb>
knock out the head of that barrel and make gruel till I<lb>
pass the word to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting her bonnet, and tying the ends of her<lb>
shawl behind her, Christie caught up a bottle of brandy<lb>
and a canteen of water, and ran on deck. There a sight<lb>
to daunt most any woman, met her eyes; for all about<lb>
her, so thick that she could hardly step without treading<lb>
on them, lay the sad wrecks of men: some<lb>
<pb n="389">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-400">

<figdesc>Page 389.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
moaning for help; some silent, with set, white faces turned up<lb>
to the gray sky; all shelterless from the cold wind that<lb>
blew, and the fog rising from the river. Surgeons and<lb>
nurses were doing their best; but the boat was loaded,<lb>
and greater suffering reigned below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help us all!&rdquo; sighed Christie, and then she<lb>
fell to work.</p>
<p>Bottle and canteen were both nearly empty by the<lb>
time she came to the end of the long line, where lay<lb>
a silent figure with a hidden face. &ldquo;Poor fellow, is he<lb>
dead?&rdquo; she said, kneeling down to lift a corner of the<lb>
blanket lent by a neighbor.</p>
<p>A familiar face looked up at her, and a well remembered<lb>
voice said courteously, but feebly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, not yet. Excuse my left hand. I 'm very<lb>
glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fletcher, can it be you!&rdquo; she cried, looking at<lb>
him with pitiful amazement. Well she might ask, for<lb>
any thing more unlike his former self can hardly be<lb>
imagined. Unshaven, haggard, and begrimed with<lb>
powder, mud to the knees, coat half on, and, worst of<lb>
all, the right arm gone, there lay the &ldquo;piece of elegance&rdquo;<lb>
she had known, and answered with a smile she<lb>
never saw before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that 's left of me, and very much at your service.<lb>
I must apologize for the dirt, but I 've laid in a<lb>
mud-puddle for two days; and, though it was much<lb>
easier than a board, it doesn't improve one's appearance.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you? Where can I put you?<lb>
I can't bear to see you here!&rdquo; said Christie, much<lb>
afflicted by the spectacle before her.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? we are all alike when it comes to this<lb>
pass. I shall do very well if I might trouble you for a<lb>
draught of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She poured her last drop into his parched mouth and<lb>
hurried off for more. She was detained by the way,<lb>
and, when she returned, fancied he was asleep, but soon<lb>
discovered that he had fainted quietly away, utterly<lb>
spent with two days of hunger, suffering, and exposure.<lb>
He was himself again directly, and lay contentedly<lb>
looking up at her as she fed him with hot soup, longing<lb>
to talk, but refusing to listen to a word till he was<lb>
refreshed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's very nice,&rdquo; he said gratefully, as he finished,<lb>
adding with a pathetic sort of gayety, as he groped<lb>
about with his one hand: &ldquo;I don't expect napkins, but<lb>
I <hi rend="italics">should</hi> like a handkerchief. They took my coat off<lb>
when they did my arm, and the gentleman who kindly<lb>
lent me this doesn't seem to have possessed such an<lb>
article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie wiped his lips with the clean towel at her<lb>
side, and smiled as she did it, at the idea of Mr. Fletcher's<lb>
praising burnt soup, and her feeding him like a<lb>
baby out of a tin cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would comfort you if I washed your face:<lb>
can you bear to have it done?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can bear to do it,&rdquo; he answered, with an<lb>
apologetic look, evidently troubled at receiving such<lb>
services from her.</p>
<p>Yet as her hands moved gently about his face, he<lb>
shut his eyes, and there was a little quiver of the lips<lb>
now and then, as if he was remembering a time when<lb>
he had hoped to have her near him in a tenderer capacity<lb>
<pb n="391">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-402">

than that of nurse. She guessed the thought, and tried<lb>
to banish it by saying cheerfully as she finished:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you look more like yourself after that. Now<lb>
the hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately for you, there is but one,&rdquo; and he<lb>
rather reluctantly surrendered a very dirty member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, I forgot. It is a brave hand, and I<lb>
am proud to wash it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; he asked, surprised at<lb>
her little burst of enthusiasm, for as she spoke she<lb>
pressed the grimy hand in both her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was recovering you from your faint, that<lb>
man over there informed me that you were his Colonel;<lb>
that you `fit like a tiger,' and when your right arm was<lb>
disabled, you took your sword in the left and cheered<lb>
them on as if you `were bound to beat the whole rebel<lb>
army.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's Drake's story,&rdquo; and Mr. Fletcher tried to<lb>
give the old shrug, but gave an irrepressible groan<lb>
instead, then endeavored to cover it, by saying in a<lb>
careless tone, &ldquo;I thought I might get a little excitement<lb>
out of it, so I went soldiering like all the rest of<lb>
you. I 'm not good for much, but I <hi rend="italics">can</hi> lead the way<lb>
for the brave fellows who do the work. Officers make<lb>
good targets, and a rebel bullet would cause no sorrow<lb>
in taking me out of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't say that! <hi rend="italics">I</hi> should grieve sincerely; and<lb>
yet I 'm very glad you came, for it will always be a<lb>
satisfaction to you in spite of your great loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are greater losses than right arms,&rdquo; muttered<lb>
Mr. Fletcher gloomily, then checked himself, and added<lb>
with a pleasant change in voice and face, as he glanced<lb>
at the wedding-ring she wore:</p>
<pb n="392">

<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-403">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not exactly the place for congratulations,<lb>
but I can't help offering mine; for if I 'm not mistaken<lb>
<hi rend="italics">your</hi> left hand also has grown doubly precious since we<lb>
met?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie had been wondering if he knew, and was<lb>
much relieved to find he took it so well. Her face said<lb>
more than her words, as she answered briefly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Yes, we were married the day David<lb>
left, and have both been in the ranks ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not wounded yet? your husband, I mean,&rdquo; he said,<lb>
getting over the hard words bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times, but not badly. I think a special angel<lb>
stands before him with a shield;&rdquo; and Christie smiled<lb>
as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a special angel stands behind him with<lb>
prayers that avail much,&rdquo; added Mr. Fletcher, looking<lb>
up at her with an expression of reverence that touched<lb>
her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I must go to my work, and you to sleep:<lb>
you need all the rest you can get before you have<lb>
to knock about in the ambulances again,&rdquo; she said,<lb>
marking the feverish color in his face, and knowing<lb>
well that excitement was his only strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I sleep in such an <hi rend="italics">Inferno</hi> as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try, you are so weak, you 'll soon drop off;&rdquo; and,<lb>
laying the cool tips of her fingers on his eyelids, she<lb>
kept them shut till he yielded with a long sigh of<lb>
mingled weariness and pleasure, and was asleep before<lb>
he knew it.</p>
<p>When he woke it was late at night; but little of<lb>
night's blessed rest was known on board that boat laden<lb>
with a freight of suffering. Cries still came up from<lb>
<pb n="393">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-404">

<figdesc>Page 393.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="17*">
below, and moans of pain still sounded from the<lb>
deek, where shadowy figures with lanterns went to<lb>
and fro among the beds that in the darkness looked<lb>
like graves.</p>
<p>Weak with pain and fever, the poor man gazed<lb>
about him half bewildered, and, conscious only of one<lb>
desire, feebly called &ldquo;Christie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am;&rdquo; and the dull light of a lantern showed<lb>
him her face very worn and tired, but full of friendliest<lb>
compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; she asked, as he clutched<lb>
her gown, and peered up at her with mingled doubt and<lb>
satisfaction in his haggard eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just speak to me; let me touch you: I thought it<lb>
was a dream; thank God it isn't. How much longer<lb>
will this last?&rdquo; he added, falling back on the softest<lb>
pillows she could find for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon land now; I believe there is an<lb>
officers' hospital in the town, and you will be quite<lb>
comfortable there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go to your hospital: where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none; and, unless the old hotel is ready, I<lb>
shall stay on the wharf with the boys until it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall stay also. Don't send me away,<lb>
Christie: I shall not be a trouble long; surely David<lb>
will let you help me die?&rdquo; and poor Fletcher stretched<lb>
his one hand imploringly to her in the first terror of the<lb>
delirium that was coming on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not leave you: I 'll take care of you, and no<lb>
one can forbid it. Drink this, Philip, and trust to<lb>
Christie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed like a child, and soon fell again into a<lb>
<pb n="394">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-405">

<figdesc>Page 394.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
troubled sleep while she sat by him thinking about<lb>
David.</p>
<p>The old hotel <hi rend="italics">was</hi> ready; but by the time he got<lb>
there Mr. Fletcher was past caring where he went, and<lb>
for a week was too ill to know any thing, except that<lb>
Christie nursed him. Then he turned the corner and<lb>
began to recover. She wanted him to go into more<lb>
comfortable quarters; but he would not stir as long as<lb>
she remained; so she put him in a little room by himself,<lb>
got a man to wait on him, and gave him as much of her<lb>
care and time as she could spare from her many duties.<lb>
He was not an agreeable patient, I regret to say;<lb>
he tried to bear his woes heroically, but did not succeed<lb>
very well, not being used to any exertion of that sort;<lb>
and, though in Christie's presence he did his best, his<lb>
man confided to her that the Colonel was &ldquo;as fractious<lb>
as a teething baby, and the domineeringest party he<lb>
ever nussed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of Mr. Fletcher's attempts were comical, and<lb>
some pathetic, for though the sacred circle of her wedding-ring<lb>
was an effectual barrier against a look or<lb>
word of love, Christie knew that the old affection was<lb>
not dead, and it showed itself in his desire to win her<lb>
respect by all sorts of small sacrifices and efforts at self-control.<lb>
He would not use many of the comforts sent<lb>
him, but insisted on wearing an army dressing-gown,<lb>
and slippers that cost him a secret pang every time his<lb>
eye was affronted by their ugliness. Always after an<lb>
angry scene with his servant, he would be found going<lb>
round among the men bestowing little luxuries and kind<lb>
words; not condescendingly, but humbly, as if it was<lb>
an atonement for his own shortcomings, and a tribute<lb>
<pb n="395">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-406">

<figdesc>Page 395.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
due to the brave fellows who bore their pains with a<lb>
fortitude he could not imitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Philip, he tries so hard I must pity, not despise<lb>
him; for he was never taught the manly virtues<lb>
that make David what he is,&rdquo; thought Christie, as she<lb>
went to him one day with an unusually happy heart.</p>
<p>She found him sitting with a newly opened package<lb>
before him, and a gloomy look upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what rubbish one of my men has sent me, thinking<lb>
I might value it,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a broken<lb>
sword-hilt and offering her a badly written letter.</p>
<p>She read it, and was touched by its affectionate respect<lb>
and manly sympathy; for the good fellow had been one<lb>
of those who saved the Colonel when he fell, and had<lb>
kept the broken sword as a trophy of his bravery,<lb>
&ldquo;thinking it might be precious in the eyes of them that<lb>
loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Burny might have spared himself the trouble,<lb>
for I 've no one to give it to, and in my eyes it 's nothing<lb>
but a bit of old metal,&rdquo; said Fletcher, pushing the parcel<lb>
away with a half-irritated, half-melancholy look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me as a parting keepsake. I have a fine<lb>
collection of relics of the brave men I have known; and<lb>
this shall have a high place in my museum when I go<lb>
home,&rdquo; said Christie, taking up the &ldquo;bit of old metal&rdquo;<lb>
with more interest than she had ever felt in the brightest<lb>
blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parting keepsake! are you going away?&rdquo; asked<lb>
Fletcher, catching at the words in anxious haste, yet<lb>
looking pleased at her desire to keep the relic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I 'm ordered to report in Washington, and<lb>
start to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="396">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-407">

<figdesc>Page 396.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I 'll go as escort. The doctor has been wanting<lb>
me to leave for a week, and now I 've no desire to<lb>
stay,&rdquo; he said eagerly.</p>
<p>But Christie shook her head, and began to fold up<lb>
paper and string with nervous industry as she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going directly to Washington: I have a<lb>
week's furlough first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is to become of me?&rdquo; asked Mr. Fletcher,<lb>
as fretfully as a sick child; for he knew where her short<lb>
holiday would be passed, and his temper got the upperhand<lb>
for a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should go home and be comfortably nursed:<lb>
you 'll need care for some time; and your friends will<lb>
be glad of a chance to give it I 've no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no home, as you know; and I don't believe<lb>
I 've got a friend in the world who cares whether I<lb>
live or die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks as if you were mistaken;&rdquo; and Christie<lb>
glanced about the little room, which was full of comforts<lb>
and luxuries accumulated during his stay.</p>
<p>His face changed instantly, and he answered with<lb>
the honest look and tone never given to any one but<lb>
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon: I 'm an ungrateful brute. But<lb>
you see I 'd just made up my mind to do something<lb>
worth the doing, and now it is made impossible in<lb>
a way that renders it hard to bear. You are very<lb>
patient with me, and I owe my life to your care:<lb>
I never can thank you for it; but I will take myself<lb>
out of your way as soon as I can, and leave you free<lb>
to enjoy your happy holiday. Heaven knows you<lb>
have earned it!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="397">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-408">

<figdesc>Page 397.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>He said those last words so heartily that all the bitterness<lb>
went out of his voice, and Christie found it<lb>
easy to reply with a cordial smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stay and see you comfortably off before I go<lb>
myself. As for thanks and reward I have had both;<lb>
for you <hi rend="italics">have</hi> done something worth the doing, and you<lb>
give me this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took up the broken blade as she spoke, and carried<lb>
it away, looking proud of her new trophy.</p>
<p>Fletcher left next day, saying, while he pressed her<lb>
hand as warmly as if the vigor of two had gone into<lb>
his one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will let me come and see you by and by when<lb>
you too get your discharge: won't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So gladly that you shall never again say you have<lb>
no home. But you must take care of yourself, or you<lb>
will get the long discharge, and we can't spare you<lb>
yet,&rdquo; she answered warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that: the worthless ones are too<lb>
often left to cumber the earth; it is the precious ones<lb>
who are taken,&rdquo; he said, thinking of her as he looked<lb>
into her tired face, and remembered all she had done<lb>
for him.</p>
<p>Christie shivered involuntarily at those ominous<lb>
words, but only said, &ldquo;Good-by, Philip,&rdquo; as he went<lb>
feebly away, leaning on his servant's arm, while all the<lb>
men touched their caps and wished the Colonel a<lb>
pleasant journey.</p>

</p>
<p>THREE months later the war seemed drawing<lb>
toward an end, and Christie was dreaming happy<lb>
dreams of home and rest with David, when, as she sat<lb>
one day writing a letter full of good news to the<lb>
wife of a patient, a telegram was handed to her, and<lb>
tearing it open she read:</p>
<cit>
<q><p>&ldquo;Captain Sterling dangerously wounded. Tell his wife to<lb>
come at once.</p></q>
<bibl>
<bibauth>E. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilkins.</hi>&rdquo;</bibauth>
</bibl>
</cit>
<p>&ldquo;No bad news I hope, ma'am?&rdquo; said the young fellow<lb>
anxiously, as his half-written letter fluttered to the<lb>
ground, and Christie sat looking at that fateful strip of<lb>
paper with all the strength and color stricken out of<lb>
her face by the fear that fell upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be worse. They told me he was dying<lb>
once, and when I got to him he met me at the door.<lb>
I 'll hope for the best now as I did then, but I never<lb>
felt like this before,&rdquo; and she hid her face as if daunted<lb>
by ominous forebodings too strong to be controlled.</p>
<p>In a moment she was up and doing as calm and steady<lb>
as if her heart was not torn by an anxiety too keen<lb>
<pb n="399">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-410">

<figdesc>Page 399.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
for words. By the time the news had flown through<lb>
the house, she was ready; and, coming down with no<lb>
luggage but a basket of comforts on her arm, she found<lb>
the hall full of wan and crippled creatures gathered<lb>
there to see her off, for no nurse in the hospital was<lb>
more beloved than Mrs. Sterling. Many eyes followed<lb>
her, &mdash; many lips blessed her, many hands were outstretched<lb>
for a sympathetic grasp: and, as the ambulance<lb>
went clattering away, many hearts echoed the<lb>
words of one grateful ghost of a man, &ldquo;The Lord go<lb>
with her and stand by her as she 's stood by us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not a long journey that lay before her; but to<lb>
Christie it seemed interminable, for all the way one unanswerable<lb>
question haunted her, &ldquo;Surely God will not<lb>
be so cruel as to take David now when he has done his<lb>
part so well and the reward is so near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was dark when she arrived at the appointed spot;<lb>
but Elisha Wilkins was there to receive her, and to her<lb>
first breathless question, &ldquo;How is David?&rdquo; answered<lb>
briskly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep and doin' well, ma'am. At least I should<lb>
say so, and I peeked at him the last thing before I<lb>
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the little hospital over yonder. Camp warn't no<lb>
place for him, and I fetched him here as the nighest, and<lb>
the best thing I could do for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he wounded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot in the shoulder, side, and arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerously you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am, that warn't and ain't my opinion. The<lb>
sergeant sent that telegram, and I think he done wrong.<lb>
<pb n="400">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-411">

</eaffig>
The Captain is hit pretty bad; but it ain't by no means<lb>
desperate accordin' to my way of thinkin',&rdquo; replied the<lb>
hopeful Wilkins, who seemed mercifully gifted with an<lb>
unusual flow of language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven! Now go on and tell me all about<lb>
it as fast as you can,&rdquo; commanded Christie, walking<lb>
along the rough road so rapidly that Private Wilkins<lb>
would have been distressed both in wind and limb if<lb>
discipline and hardship had not done much for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see we 've been skirmishin' round here<lb>
for a week, for the woods are full of rebs waitin' to<lb>
surprise some commissary stores that 's expected along.<lb>
Contrabands is always comin' into camp, and we do the<lb>
best we can for the poor devils, and send 'em along<lb>
where they 'll be safe. Yesterday four women and a<lb>
boy come: about as desperate a lot as I ever see; for<lb>
they 'd been two days and a night in the big swamp,<lb>
wadin' up to their waists in mud and water, with nothin'<lb>
to eat, and babies on their backs all the way. Every<lb>
woman had a child, one dead, but she 'd fetched it, `so<lb>
it might be buried free,' the poor soul said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins stopped an instant as if for breath, but<lb>
the thought of his own &ldquo;little chaps&rdquo; filled his heart<lb>
with pity for that bereaved mother; and he understood<lb>
now why decent men were willing to be shot and<lb>
starved for &ldquo;the confounded niggers,&rdquo; as he once called<lb>
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Christie, and he made haste to tell the<lb>
little story that was so full of intense interest to his<lb>
listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw the Captain so worked up as he was by<lb>
the sight of them wretched women. He fed and warmed<lb>
<pb n="401">

<milestn unit="collation" n="Z">
'em, comforted their poor scared souls, give what clothes<lb>
we could find, buried the dead baby with his own<lb>
hands, and nussed the other little creeters as if they<lb>
were his own. It warn't safe to keep 'em more 'n a<lb>
day, so when night come the Captain got 'em off down<lb>
the river as quiet as he could. Me and another man<lb>
helped him, for he wouldn't trust no one but himself to<lb>
boss the job. A boat was ready, &mdash; blest if I know how<lb>
he got it, &mdash; and about midnight we led them women<lb>
down to it. The boy was a strong lad, and any of 'em<lb>
could help row, for the current would take 'em along<lb>
rapid. This way, ma'am; be we goin' too fast for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fast enough. Finish quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got down the bank all right, the Captain standing<lb>
in the little path that led to the river to keep guard,<lb>
while Bates held the boat stiddy and I put the women<lb>
in. Things was goin' lovely when the poor gal who 'd<lb>
lost her baby must needs jump out and run up to thank<lb>
the Captain agin for all he 'd done for her. Some of<lb>
them sly rascals was watchin' the river: they see her,<lb>
heard Bates call out, `Come back, wench; come back!'<lb>
and they fired. She did come back like a shot, and we<lb>
give that boat a push that sent it into the middle of<lb>
the stream. Then we run along below the bank, and<lb>
come out further down to draw off the rebs. Some<lb>
followed us and we give it to 'em handsome. But<lb>
some warn't deceived, and we heard 'em firin' away at<lb>
the Captain; so we got back to him as fast as we could,<lb>
but it warn't soon enough. &mdash; Take my arm, Mis' Sterlin':<lb>
it 's kinder rough here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you found him?&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyin' right acrost the path with two dead men in<lb>

front of him; for he 'd kep 'em off like a lion till the<lb>
firin' brought up a lot of our fellers and the rebs skedaddled.<lb>
I thought he was dead, for by the starlight<lb>
I see he was bleedin' awful, &mdash; hold on, my dear, hold<lb>
on to me, &mdash; he warn 't, thank God, and looked up at me<lb>
and sez, sez he, `Are they safe?' `They be, Captain,'<lb>
sez I. `Then it 's all right,' sez he, smilin' in that<lb>
bright way of his, and then dropped off as quiet as a<lb>
lamb. We got him back to camp double quick, and<lb>
when the surgeon see them three wounds he shook his<lb>
head, and I mistrusted that it warn't no joke. So when<lb>
the Captain come to I asked him what I could do or<lb>
git for him, and he answered in a whisper, `My wife.&rdquo;'</p>
<p>For an instant Christie did &ldquo;hold on&rdquo; to Mr. Wilkins's<lb>
arm, for those two words seemed to take all her strength<lb>
away. Then the thought that David was waiting for<lb>
her strung her nerves and gave her courage to bear<lb>
any thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo; she asked of her guide a moment<lb>
later, as he stopped before a large, half-ruined house,<lb>
through whose windows dim lights and figures were<lb>
seen moving to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am; we 've made a hospital of this; the<lb>
Captain 's got the best room in it, and now he 's got the<lb>
best nuss that 's goin' anywheres. Won't you have a drop<lb>
of something jest as a stand-by before you see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; take me to him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we be then. Still sleepin': that looks well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins softly led the way down a long hall,<lb>
opened a door, and after one look fell back and saluted<lb>
as the Captain's wife passed in.</p>
<p>A surgeon was bending over the low bed, and when<lb>
a hoarse voice at his elbow asked:</p>
<pb n="403">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-414">

<figdesc>Page 403.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; The doctor answered without looking<lb>
up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done for: this shot through the lungs will finish<lb>
him before morning I 'm afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave him to me: I am his wife,&rdquo; said the<lb>
voice, clear and sharp now with the anguish those hard<lb>
words had brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God, why did no one tell me! My dear lady,<lb>
I thought you were a nurse!&rdquo; cried the poor surgeon<lb>
rent with remorse for what now seemed the brutal<lb>
frankness of his answer, as he saw the white face of<lb>
the woman at his side, with a look in her eyes harder<lb>
to see than the bitterest tears that ever fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> a nurse. If you can do nothing, please go and<lb>
leave him to me the little while he has to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the surgeon vanished, and Christie<lb>
was alone with David.</p>
<p>The instant she saw him she felt that there was no<lb>
hope, for she had seen too many faces wear the look his<lb>
wore to be deceived even by her love. Lying with<lb>
closed eyes already sunken by keen suffering, hair damp<lb>
with the cold dew on his forehead, a scarlet spot on<lb>
either cheek, gray lines about the mouth, and pale lips<lb>
parted by the painful breaths that came in heavy gasps<lb>
or fluttered fitfully. This was what Christie saw, and<lb>
after that long look she knew the truth, and sunk down<lb>
beside the bed, crying with an exceeding bitter cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O David, O my husband, must I give you up so<lb>
soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes opened then, and he turned his cheek to<lb>
hers, whispering with a look that tried to be a smile,<lb>
but ended in a sigh of satisfaction:</p>
<pb n="404">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-415">

<figdesc>Page 404.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you 'd come;&rdquo; then, as a tearless sob shook<lb>
her from head to foot, he added steadily, though each<lb>
breath cost a pang, &ldquo;Yes, dear, I must go first, but it<lb>
won't be hard with you to help me do it bravely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that supremely bitter moment there returned to<lb>
Christie's memory certain words of the marriage service<lb>
that had seemed so beautiful when she took part in it:<lb>
&ldquo;For better for worse, till death us do part.&rdquo; She had<lb>
known the better, so short, so sweet! This was the worse,<lb>
and till death came she must keep faithfully the promise<lb>
made with such a happy heart. The thought brought<lb>
with it unexpected strength, and gave her courage to<lb>
crush down her grief, seal up her tears, and show a<lb>
brave and tender face as she took that feeble hand in<lb>
hers ready to help her husband die.</p>
<p>He saw and thanked her for the effort, felt the<lb>
sustaining power of a true wife's heart, and seemed<lb>
to have no other care, since she was by him steadfast<lb>
to the end. He lay looking at her with such<lb>
serene and happy eyes that she would not let a tear,<lb>
a murmur, mar his peace; and for a little while she<lb>
felt as if she had gone out of this turbulent world<lb>
into a heavenly one, where love reigned supreme.</p>
<p>But such hours are as brief as beautiful, and at<lb>
midnight mortal suffering proved that immortal joy<lb>
had not yet begun.</p>
<p>Christie had sat by many death-beds, but never one<lb>
like this; for, through all the bitter pangs that tried<lb>
his flesh, David's soul remained patient and strong,<lb>
upheld by the faith that conquers pain and makes<lb>
even Death a friend. In the quiet time that went before,<lb>
he had told his last wishes, given his last<lb>
<pb n="405">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-416">

<figdesc>Page 405.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
messages of love, and now had but one desire, &mdash; to go soon<lb>
that Christie might be spared the trial of seeing suffering<lb>
she could neither lighten nor share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and rest, dear; go and rest,&rdquo; he whispered more<lb>
than once. &ldquo;Let Wilkins come: this is too much for<lb>
you. I thought it would be easier, but I am so strong<lb>
life fights for me inch by inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Christie would not go, and for her sake David<lb>
made haste to die.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the tide ebbed fast, hour after hour<lb>
the man's patient soul sat waiting for release, and<lb>
hour after hour the woman's passionate heart clung<lb>
to the love that seemed drifting away leaving her<lb>
alone upon the shore. Once or twice she could not<lb>
bear it, and cried out in her despair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not just that you should suffer this for<lb>
a creature whose whole life is not worth a day of<lb>
your brave, useful, precious one! Why did you pay<lb>
such a price for that girl's liberty?&rdquo; she said, as the<lb>
thought of her own wrecked future fell upon her dark<lb>
and heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I owed it; &mdash; she suffered more than this<lb>
seeing her baby die; &mdash; I thought of <hi rend="italics">you</hi> in her place,<lb>
and I could not help doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The broken answer, the reproachful look, wrung<lb>
Christie's heart, and she was silent: for, in all the<lb>
knightly tales she loved so well, what Sir Galahad had<lb>
rescued a more wretched, wronged, and helpless woman<lb>
than the poor soul whose dead baby David buried tenderly<lb>
before he bought the mother's freedom with his<lb>
life?</p>
<p>Only one regret escaped him as the end drew very<lb>

near, and mortal weakness brought relief from mortal<lb>
pain. The first red streaks of dawn shone in the east,<lb>
and his dim eyes brightened at the sight;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a beautiful world!&rdquo; he whispered with the<lb>
ghost of a smile, &ldquo;and so much good work to do in<lb>
it, I wish I could stay and help a little longer,&rdquo; he<lb>
added, while the shadow deepened on his face. But<lb>
soon he said, trying to press Christie's hand, still holding<lb>
his: &ldquo;You will do my part, and do it better than<lb>
I could. Don't mourn, dear heart, but work; and by<lb>
and by you will be comforted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try; but I think I shall soon follow you,<lb>
and need no comfort here,&rdquo; answered Christie, already<lb>
finding consolation in the thought. &ldquo;What is it,<lb>

David?&rdquo; she asked a little later, as she saw his eyes<lb>
turn wistfully toward the window where the rosy glow<lb>
was slowly creeping up the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see the sun rise; &mdash; that used to be our<lb>
happy time; &mdash; turn my face toward the light, Christie,<lb>
and we 'll wait for it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later when the first pale ray crept in at<lb>
the low window, two faces lay upon the pillow; one<lb>
full of the despairing grief for which there seems no<lb>
balm; the other with lips and eyes of solemn peace,<lb>
and that mysterious expression, lovelier than any smile,<lb>
which death leaves as a tender token that all is well<lb>
with the new-born soul.</p>
<p>To Christie that was the darkest hour of the dawn,<lb>
but for David sunrise had already come.</p>

<p>WHEN it was all over, the long journey home,<lb>
the quiet funeral, the first sad excitement, then<lb>
came the bitter moment when life says to the bereaved:<lb>
&ldquo;Take up your burden and go on alone.&rdquo; Christie 's<lb>
had been the still, tearless grief hardest to bear, most<lb>
impossible to comfort; and, while Mrs. Sterling bore<lb>
her loss with the sweet patience of a pious heart, and<lb>
Letty mourned her brother with the tender sorrow that<lb>
finds relief in natural ways, the widow sat among them<lb>
as tranquil, colorless, and mute, as if her soul had followed<lb>
David, leaving the shadow of her former self<lb>
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not come to me, but I shall go to him,&rdquo;<lb>
seemed to be the thought that sustained her, and those<lb>
who loved her said despairingly to one another: &ldquo;Her<lb>
heart is broken: she will not linger long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one woman wise in her own motherliness always<lb>
answered hopefully: &ldquo;Don't you be troubled; Nater<lb>
knows what 's good for us, and works in her own way.<lb>
Hearts like this don't break, and sorrer only makes 'em<lb>
stronger. You mark my words: the blessed baby that 's<lb>
a comin' in the summer will work a merrycle, and<lb>
you 'll see this poor dear a happy woman yet.&rdquo;</p>

<milestn unit="collation" n="18">
<p>Few believed in the prophecy; but Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
stoutly repeated it and watched over Christie like a<lb>
mother; often trudging up the lane in spite of wind or<lb>
weather to bring some dainty mess, some remarkable<lb>
puzzle in red or yellow calico to be used as a pattern<lb>
for the little garments the three women sewed with<lb>
such tender interest, consecrated with such tender<lb>
tears; or news of the war fresh from Lisha who &ldquo;was<lb>
goin' to see it through ef he come home without a leg<lb>
to stand on.&rdquo; A cheery, hopeful, wholesome influence<lb>
she brought with her, and all the house seemed to<lb>
brighten as she sat there freeing her mind upon every<lb>
subject that came up, from the delicate little shirts Mrs.<lb>
Sterling knit in spite of failing eyesight, to the fall of<lb>
Richmond, which, the prophetic spirit being strong<lb>
within her, Mrs. Wilkins foretold with sibylline precision.<lb>
</p>
<p>She alone could win a faint smile from Christie with<lb>
some odd saying, some shrewd opinion, and she alone<lb>
brought tears to the melancholy eyes that sorely needed<lb>
such healing dew; for she carried little Adelaide, and<lb>
without a word put her into Christie's arms, there to<lb>
cling and smile and babble till she had soothed the<lb>
bitter pain and hunger of a suffering heart.</p>
<p>She and Mr. Power held Christie up through that<lb>
hard time, ministering to soul and body with their<lb>
hope and faith till life grew possible again, and from<lb>
the dust of a great affliction rose the sustaining power<lb>
she had sought so long.</p>
<p>As spring came on, and victory after victory proclaimed<lb>
that the war was drawing to an end, Christie's<lb>
sad resignation was broken by gusts of grief so stormy,<lb>
<pb n="410">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-421">

<figdesc>Page 410.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
so inconsolable, that those about her trembled for her<lb>
life. It was so hard to see the regiments come home<lb>
proudly bearing the torn battle-flags, weary, wounded,<lb>
but victorious, to be rapturously welcomed, thanked,<lb>
and honored by the grateful country they had served<lb>
so well; to see all this and think of David in his grave<lb>
unknown, unrewarded, and forgotten by all but a faithful<lb>
few.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to dream of a time like this, to hope and<lb>
plan for it, and cheer myself with the assurance that,<lb>
after all our hard work, our long separation, and the<lb>
dangers we had faced, David would get some honor,<lb>
receive some reward, at least be kept for me to love<lb>
and serve and live with for a little while. But these<lb>
men who have merely saved a banner, led a charge, or<lb>
lost an arm, get all the glory, while he gave his life so<lb>
nobly; yet few know it, no one thanked him, and I am<lb>
left desolate when so many useless ones might have<lb>
been taken in his place. Oh, it is not just! I cannot<lb>
forgive God for robbing him of all his honors, and me<lb>
of all my happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So lamented Christie with the rebellious protest of a<lb>
strong nature learning submission through the stern<lb>
discipline of grief. In vain Mr. Power told her that<lb>
David <hi rend="italics">had</hi> received a better reward than any human<lb>
hand could give him, in the gratitude of many women,<lb>
the respect of many men. That to do bravely the<lb>
daily duties of an upright life was more heroic in God's<lb>
sight, than to achieve in an enthusiastic moment a<lb>
single deed that won the world's applause; and that<lb>
the seeming incompleteness of his life was beautifully<lb>
rounded by the act that caused his death, although no<lb>
<pb n="411">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-422">

<figdesc>Page 411.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
eulogy recorded it, no song embalmed it, and few knew<lb>
it but those he saved, those he loved, and the Great<lb>
Commander who promoted him to the higher rank he<lb>
had won.</p>
<p>Christie could not be content with this invisible,<lb>
intangible recompense for her hero: she wanted to see,<lb>
to know beyond a doubt, that justice had been done;<lb>
and beat herself against the barrier that baffles bereaved<lb>
humanity till impatient despair was wearied out, and<lb>
passionate heart gave up the struggle.</p>
<p>Then, when no help seemed possible, she found it<lb>
where she least expected it, in herself. Searching for<lb>
religion, she had found love: now seeking to follow love<lb>
she found religion. The desire for it had never left<lb>
her, and, while serving others, she was earning this<lb>
reward; for when her life seemed to lie in ashes, from<lb>
their midst, this slender spire of flame, purifying while<lb>
it burned, rose trembling toward heaven; showing her<lb>
how great sacrifices turn to greater compensations;<lb>
giving her light, warmth, and consolation, and teaching<lb>
her the lesson all must learn.</p>
<p>God was very patient with her, sending much help,<lb>
and letting her climb up to Him by all the tender ways<lb>
in which aspiring souls can lead unhappy hearts.</p>
<p>David's room had been her refuge when those dark<lb>
hours came, and sitting there one day trying to understand<lb>
the great mystery that parted her from David,<lb>
she seemed to receive an answer to her many prayers<lb>
for some sign that death had not estranged them. The<lb>
house was very still, the window open, and a soft south<lb>
wind was wandering through the room with hints of<lb>
May-flowers on its wings. Suddenly a breath of music<lb>
<pb n="412">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-423">

<figdesc>Page 412.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
startled her, so airy, sweet, and short-lived that no<lb>
human voice or hand could have produced it. Again<lb>
and again it came, a fitful and melodious sigh, that<lb>
to one made superstitious by much sorrow, seemed like<lb>
a spirit's voice delivering some message from another<lb>
world.</p>
<p>Christie looked and listened with hushed breath and<lb>
expectant heart, believing that some special answer was<lb>
to be given her. But in a moment she saw it was no<lb>
supernatural sound, only the south wind whispering in<lb>
David's flute that hung beside the window. Disappointment<lb>
came first, then warm over her sore heart<lb>
flowed the tender recollection that she used to call the<lb>
old flute &ldquo;David's voice,&rdquo; for into it he poured the joy<lb>
and sorrow, unrest and pain, he told no living soul.<lb>
How often it had been her lullaby, before she learned<lb>
to read its language; how gaily it had piped for others;<lb>
how plaintively it had sung for him, alone and in the<lb>
night; and now how full of pathetic music was that<lb>
hymn of consolation fitfully whispered by the wind's<lb>
soft breath.</p>
<p>Ah, yes! this was a better answer than any supernatural<lb>
voice could have given her; a more helpful sign<lb>
than any phantom face or hand; a surer confirmation of<lb>
her hope than subtle argument or sacred promise: for<lb>
it brought back the memory of the living, loving man<lb>
so vividly, so tenderly, that Christie felt as if the barrier<lb>
was down, and welcomed a new sense of David's nearness<lb>
with the softest tears that had flowed since she<lb>
closed the serene eyes whose last look had been for<lb>
her.</p>
<p>After that hour she spent the long spring days lying<lb>
<pb n="413">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-424">

<figdesc>Page 413.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
on the old couch in his room, reading his books, thinking<lb>
of his love and life, and listening to &ldquo;David's voice.&rdquo;<lb>
She always heard it now, whether the wind touched<lb>
the flute with airy fingers or it hung mute; and it sung<lb>
to her songs of patience, hope, and cheer, till a mysterious<lb>
peace came to her, and she discovered in herself<lb>
the strength she had asked, yet never thought to find.<lb>
Under the snow, herbs of grace had been growing<lb>
silently; and, when the heavy rains had melted all the<lb>
frost away, they sprung up to blossom beautifully in the<lb>
sun that shines for every spire of grass, and makes it<lb>
perfect in its time and place.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins was right; for one June morning, when<lb>
she laid &ldquo;that blessed baby&rdquo; in its mother's arms,<lb>
Christie's first words were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't let me die: I must live for baby now,&rdquo; and<lb>
gathered David's little daughter to her breast, as if the<lb>
soft touch of the fumbling hands had healed every<lb>
wound and brightened all the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so; God bless 'em both!&rdquo; and Mrs. Wilkins<lb>
retired precipitately to the hall, where she sat down<lb>
upon the stairs and cried most comfortable tears; for<lb>
her maternal heart was full of a thanksgiving too deep<lb>
for words.</p>
<p>A sweet, secluded time to Christie, as she brooded<lb>
over her little treasure and forgot there was a world<lb>
outside. A fond and jealous mother, but a very happy<lb>
one, for after the bitterest came the tenderest experience<lb>
of her life. She felt its sacredness, its beauty, and<lb>
its high responsibilities; accepted them prayerfully,<lb>
and found unspeakable delight in fitting herself to bear<lb>
them worthily, always remembering that she had a<lb>
<pb n="414">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-425">

<figdesc>Page 414.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
double duty to perform toward the fatherless little<lb>
creature given to her care.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to mention the changes one<lb>
small individual made in that feminine household. The<lb>
purring and clucking that went on; the panics over a<lb>
pin-prick; the consultations over a pellet of chamomilla;<lb>
the raptures at the dawn of a first smile; the<lb>
solemn prophecies of future beauty, wit, and wisdom in<lb>
the bud of a woman; the general adoration of the<lb>
entire family at the wicker shrine wherein lay the idol,<lb>
a mass of flannel and cambric with a bald head at one<lb>
end, and a pair of microscopic blue socks at the other.<lb>
Mysterious little porringers sat unreproved upon the<lb>
parlor fire, small garments aired at every window,<lb>
lights burned at unholy hours, and three agitated nightcaps<lb>
congregated at the faintest chirp of the restless<lb>
bird in the maternal nest.</p>
<p>Of course Grandma grew young again, and produced<lb>
nursery reminiscences on every occasion; Aunt Letty<lb>
trotted day and night to gratify the imaginary wants<lb>
of the idol, and Christie was so entirely absorbed that<lb>
the whole South might have been swallowed up by an<lb>
earthquake without causing her as much consternation<lb>
as the appearance of a slight rash upon the baby.</p>
<p>No flower in David's garden throve like his little June<lb>
rose, for no wind was allowed to visit her too roughly;<lb>
and when rain fell without, she took her daily airing in<lb>
the green-house, where from her mother's arms she soon<lb>
regarded the gay sight with such sprightly satisfaction<lb>
that she seemed a little flower herself dancing on its<lb>
stem.</p>
<p>She was named Ruth for grandma, but Christie<lb>
<pb n="415">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-426">

<figdesc>Page 415.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
always called her &ldquo;Little Heart's-ease,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pansy,&rdquo; and<lb>
those who smiled at first at the mother's fancy, came in<lb>
time to see that there was an unusual fitness in the<lb>
name. All the bitterness seemed taken out of Christie's<lb>
sorrow by the soft magic of the child: there was<lb>
so much to live for now she spoke no more of dying;<lb>
and, holding that little hand in hers, it grew easier to<lb>
go on along the way that led to David.</p>
<p>A prouder mother never lived; and, as baby waxed<lb>
in beauty and in strength, Christie longed for all the<lb>
world to see her. A sweet, peculiar, little face she had,<lb>
sunny and fair; but, under the broad forehead where<lb>
the bright hair fell as David's used to do, there shone<lb>
a pair of dark and solemn eyes, so large, so deep, and<lb>
often so unchildlike, that her mother wondered where<lb>
she got them. Even when she smiled the shadow lingered<lb>
in these eyes, and when she wept they filled and<lb>
overflowed with great, quiet tears like flowers too full<lb>
of dew. Christie often said remorsefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little Pansy! I put my own sorrow into your<lb>
baby soul, and now it looks back at me with this<lb>
strange wistfulness, and these great drops are the unsubmissive<lb>
tears I locked up in my heart because I<lb>
would not be grateful for the good gift God gave me,<lb>
even while he took that other one away. O Baby,<lb>
forgive your mother; and don't let her find that she<lb>
has given you clouds instead of sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fear helped Christie to keep her own face cheerful,<lb>
her own heart tranquil, her own life as sunny,<lb>
healthful, and hopeful as she wished her child's to be.<lb>
For this reason she took garden and green-house into<lb>
her own hands when Bennet gave them up, and, with a<lb>
<pb n="416">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-427">

<figdesc>Page 416.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
stout lad to help her, did well this part of the work<lb>
that David bequeathed to her. It was a pretty sight<lb>
to see the mother with her year-old daughter out<lb>
among the fresh, green things: the little golden head<lb>
bobbing here and there like a stray sunbeam; the baby<lb>
voice telling sweet, unintelligible stories to bird and<lb>
bee and butterfly; or the small creature fast asleep in<lb>
a basket under a rose-bush, swinging in a hammock<lb>
from a tree, or in Bran's keeping, rosy, vigorous, and<lb>
sweet with sun and air, and the wholesome influence<lb>
of a wise and tender love.</p>
<p>While Christie worked she planned her daughter's<lb>
future, as mothers will, and had but one care concerning<lb>
it. She did not fear poverty, but the thought of<lb>
being straitened for the means of educating little<lb>
Ruth afflicted her. She meant to teach her to labor<lb>
heartily and see no degradation in it, but she could not<lb>
bear to feel that her child should be denied the harmless<lb>
pleasures that make youth sweet, the opportunities<lb>
that educate, the society that ripens character and<lb>
gives a rank which money cannot buy. A little sum to<lb>
put away for Baby, safe from all risk, ready to draw<lb>
from as each need came, and sacredly devoted to this<lb>
end, was now Christie's sole ambition.</p>
<p>With this purpose at her heart, she watched her<lb>
fruit and nursed her flowers; found no task too hard,<lb>
no sun too hot, no weed too unconquerable; and soon<lb>
the garden David planted when his life seemed barren,<lb>
yielded lovely harvests to swell his little daughter's<lb>
portion.</p>
<p>One day Christie received a letter from Uncle Enos<lb>
expressing a wish to see her if she cared to come so<lb>
<pb n="417">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-428">

<figdesc>Page 417.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="18* AA">
far and &ldquo;stop a spell.&rdquo; It both surprised and pleased<lb>
her, and she resolved to go, glad that the old man<lb>
remembered her, and proud to show him the great success<lb>
of her life, as she considered Baby.</p>
<p>So she went, was hospitably received by the ancient<lb>
cousin five times removed who kept house, and greeted<lb>
with as much cordiality as Uncle Enos ever showed to<lb>
any one. He looked askance at Baby, as if he had<lb>
not bargained for the honor of her presence; but he<lb>
said nothing, and Christie wisely refrained from mentioning<lb>
that Ruth was the most remarkable child ever<lb>
born.</p>
<p>She soon felt at home, and went about the old house<lb>
visiting familiar nooks with the bitter, sweet satisfaction<lb>
of such returns. It was sad to miss Aunt Betsey in the<lb>
big kitchen, strange to see Uncle Enos sit all day in his<lb>
arm-chair too helpless now to plod about the farm and<lb>
carry terror to the souls of those who served him. He<lb>
was still a crabbed, gruff, old man; but the narrow,<lb>
hard, old heart was a little softer than it used to be; and<lb>
he sometimes betrayed the longing for his kindred that<lb>
the aged often feel when infirmity makes them desire<lb>
tenderer props than any they can hire.</p>
<p>Christie saw this wish, and tried to gratify it with a<lb>
dutiful affection which could not fail to win its way.<lb>
Baby unconsciously lent a hand, for Uncle Enos could<lb>
not long withstand the sweet enticements of this little<lb>
kinswoman. He did not own the conquest in words,<lb>
but was seen to cuddle his small captivator in private;<lb>
allowed all sorts of liberties with his spectacles, his<lb>
pockets, and bald pate; and never seemed more comfortable<lb>
than when she confiscated his newspaper, and<lb>

sitting on his knee read it to him in a pretty language<lb>
of her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She 's a good little gal; looks consid'able like you;<lb>
but you warn't never such a quiet puss as she is,&rdquo; he<lb>
said one day, as the child was toddling about the room<lb>
with an old doll of her mother's lately disinterred from<lb>
its tomb in the garret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is like her father in that. But I get quieter as<lb>
I grow old, uncle,&rdquo; answered Christie, who sat sewing<lb>
near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be growing old, that 's a fact; but somehow<lb>
it's kind of becomin'. I never thought you 'd be so<lb>
much of a lady, and look so well after all you 've ben<lb>
through,&rdquo; added Uncle Enos, vainly trying to discover<lb>
what made Christie's manners so agreeable in spite of<lb>
her plain dress, and her face so pleasant in spite of the<lb>
gray hair at her temples and the lines about her<lb>
mouth.</p>
<p>It grew still pleasanter to see as she smiled and<lb>
looked up at him with the soft yet bright expression<lb>
that always made him think of her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm glad you don't consider me an entire failure,<lb>
uncle. You know you predicted it. But though I<lb>
have gone through a good deal, I don't regret my<lb>
attempt, and when I look at Pansy I feel as if I 'd made<lb>
a grand success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven't made much money, I guess. If you<lb>
don't mind tellin', what <hi rend="italics">have</hi> you got to live on?'<lb>
asked the old man, unwilling to acknowledge any life<lb>
a success, if dollars and cents were left out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only David's pension and what I can make by my<lb>
garden.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old lady has to have some on 't, don't she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a little money of her own; but I see that<lb>
she and Letty have two-thirds of all I make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain't a fair bargain if you do all the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but we don't make bargains, sir: we work for<lb>
one another and share every thing together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So like women!&rdquo; grumbled Uncle Enos, longing to<lb>
see that &ldquo;the property was fixed up square.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="420">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-431">

</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you goin' to eddicate the little gal? I<lb>
s'pose you think as much of culter and so on as ever<lb>
you did,&rdquo; he presently added with a gruff laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More,&rdquo; answered Christie, smiling too, as she remembered<lb>
the old quarrels. &ldquo;I shall earn the money, sir.<lb>
If the garden fails I can teach, nurse, sew, write, cook<lb>
even, for I 've half a dozen useful accomplishments at<lb>
my fingers' ends, thanks to the education you and dear<lb>
Aunt Betsey gave me, and I may have to use them all<lb>
for Pansy's sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleased by the compliment, yet a little consciencestricken<lb>
at the small share he deserved of it, Uncle Enos<lb>
sat rubbing up his glasses a minute, before he led to the<lb>
subject he had in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef you fall sick or die, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 've thought of that,&rdquo; and Christie caught up the<lb>
child as if her love could keep even death at bay. But<lb>
Pansy soon struggled down again, for the dirty-faced<lb>
doll was taking a walk and could not be detained. &ldquo;If<lb>
I am taken from her, then my little girl must do as her<lb>
mother did. God has orphans in His special care, and<lb>
He won't forget her I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Enos had a coughing spell just then; and, when<lb>
he got over it, he said with an effort, for even to talk<lb>
of giving away his substance cost him a pang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'm gettin' into years now, and it 's about time I<lb>
fixed up matters in case I 'm took suddin'. I always<lb>
meant to give you a little suthing, but as you didn't<lb>
ask for 't, I took good care on 't, and it ain't none the<lb>
worse for waitin' a spell. I jest speak on 't, so you<lb>
needn't be anxious about the little gal. It ain't much,<lb>
but it will make things easy I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="421">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-432">

<figdesc>Page 421.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, uncle; and I am more grateful<lb>
than I can tell. I don't want a penny for myself, but I<lb>
should love to know that my daughter was to have an<lb>
easier life than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s'pose you thought of that when you come so<lb>
quick?&rdquo; said the old man, with a suspicious look, that<lb>
made Christie's eyes kindle as they used to years ago,<lb>
but she answered honestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did think of it and hope it, yet I should have<lb>
come quicker if you had been in the poor-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither spoke for a minute; for, in spite of generosity<lb>
and gratitude, the two natures struck fire when they<lb>
met as inevitably as flint and steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What 's your opinion of missionaries,&rdquo; asked Uncle<lb>
Enos, after a spell of meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had any money to leave them, I should bequeath<lb>
it to those who help the heathen here at home,<lb>
and should let the innocent Feejee Islanders worship<lb>
their idols a little longer in benighted peace,&rdquo; answered<lb>
Christie, in her usual decided way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's my idee exactly; but it 's uncommon hard to<lb>
settle <hi rend="italics">which</hi> of them that stays at home you 'll trust<lb>
your money to. You see Betsey was always pesterin'<lb>
me to give to charity things; but I told her it was better<lb>
to save up and give it in a handsome lump that<lb>
looked well, and was a credit to you. When she was<lb>
dyin' she reminded me on 't, and I promised I 'd do<lb>
suthing before I follered. I 've been turnin' on 't over<lb>
in my mind for a number of months, and I don't<lb>
seem to find any thing that 's jest right. You 've ben<lb>
round among the charity folks lately accordin' to your<lb>
tell, now what would you do if you had a tidy little<lb>
sum to dispose on?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="422">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-433">

<figdesc>Page 422.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help the Freed people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer came so quick that it nearly took the old<lb>
gentleman's breath away, and he looked at his niece<lb>
with his mouth open after an involuntary, &ldquo;Sho!&rdquo;<lb>
had escaped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David helped give them their liberty, and I would<lb>
so gladly help them to enjoy it!&rdquo; cried Christie, all the<lb>
old enthusiasm blazing up, but with a clearer, steadier<lb>
flame than in the days when she dreamed splendid<lb>
dreams by the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, that wouldn't meet my views. What<lb>
else is there?&rdquo; asked the old man quite unwarmed by<lb>
her benevolent ardor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wounded soldiers, destitute children, ill-paid<lb>
women, young people struggling for independence,<lb>
homes, hospitals, schools, churches, and God's charity<lb>
all over the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's the pesky part on 't: there 's such a lot<lb>
to choose from; I don't know much about any of 'em,&rdquo;<lb>
began Uncle Enos, looking like a perplexed raven with<lb>
a treasure which it cannot decide where to hide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose fault is that, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question hit the old man full in the conscience,<lb>
and he winced, remembering how many of Betsey's<lb>
charitable impulses he had nipped in the bud, and<lb>
now all the accumulated alms she would have been<lb>
so glad to scatter weighed upon him heavily. He<lb>
rubbed his bald head with a yellow bandana, and<lb>
moved uneasily in his chair, as if he wanted to get up<lb>
and finish the neglected job that made his helplessness<lb>
so burdensome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I 'll ponder on 't a spell, and make up my mind,&rdquo;<lb>
was all he said, and never renewed the subject again.</p>
<pb n="423">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-434">

<figdesc>Page 423.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>But he had very little time to ponder, and he never<lb>
did make up his mind; for a few months after Christie's<lb>
long visit ended, Uncle Enos &ldquo;was took suddin',&rdquo; and<lb>
left all he had to her.</p>
<p>Not an immense fortune, but far larger than she expected,<lb>
and great was her anxiety to use wisely this<lb>
unlooked-for benefaction. She was very grateful, but<lb>
she kept nothing for herself, feeling that David's pension<lb>
was enough, and preferring the small sum he earned<lb>
so dearly to the thousands the old man had hoarded up<lb>
for years. A good portion was put by for Ruth, something<lb>
for &ldquo;mother and Letty&rdquo; that want might never<lb>
touch them, and the rest she kept for David's work,<lb>
believing that, so spent, the money would be blest.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;NEARLY twenty years since I set out to seek my<lb>
fortune. It has been a long search, but I think<lb>
I have found it at last. I only asked to be a useful,<lb>
happy woman, and my wish is granted: for, I believe<lb>
I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> useful; I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> I am happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie looked so as she sat alone in the flowery parlor<lb>
one September afternoon, thinking over her life with<lb>
a grateful, cheerful spirit. Forty to-day, and pausing at<lb>
that half-way house between youth and age, she looked<lb>
back into the past without bitter regret or unsubmissive<lb>
grief, and forward into the future with courageous patience;<lb>
for three good angels attended her, and with<lb>
faith, hope, and charity to brighten life, no woman need<lb>
lament lost youth or fear approaching age. Christie<lb>
did not, and though her eyes filled with quiet tears as<lb>
they were raised to the faded cap and sheathed sword<lb>
hanging on the wall, none fell; and in a moment tender<lb>
sorrow changed to still tenderer joy as her glance wandered<lb>
to rosy little Ruth playing hospital with her dollies<lb>
in the porch. Then they shone with genuine satisfaction<lb>
as they went from the letters and papers on her<lb>
table to the garden, where several young women were<lb>
<pb n="425">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-436">

<figdesc>Page 425.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
at work with a healthful color in the cheeks that had<lb>
been very pale and thin in the spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think David is satisfied with me; for I have given<lb>
all my heart and strength to his work, and it prospers<lb>
well,&rdquo; she said to herself, and then her face grew<lb>
thoughtful, as she recalled a late event which seemed to<lb>
have opened a new field of labor for her if she chose to<lb>
enter it.</p>
<p>A few evenings before she had gone to one of the<lb>
many meetings of working-women, which had made<lb>
some stir of late. Not a first visit, for she was much<lb>
interested in the subject and full of sympathy for this<lb>
class of workers.</p>
<p>There were speeches of course, and of the most<lb>
unparliamentary sort, for the meeting was composed<lb>
almost entirely of women, each eager to tell her special<lb>
grievance or theory. Any one who chose got up and<lb>
spoke; and whether wisely or foolishly each proved how<lb>
great was the ferment now going on, and how difficult<lb>
it was for the two classes to meet and help one another<lb>
in spite of the utmost need on one side and the sincerest<lb>
good-will on the other. The workers poured out<lb>
their wrongs and hardships passionately or plaintively,<lb>
demanding or imploring justice, sympathy, and help;<lb>
displaying the ignorance, incapacity, and prejudice,<lb>
which make their need all the more pitiful, their relief<lb>
all the more imperative.</p>
<p>The ladies did their part with kindliness, patience,<lb>
and often unconscious condescension, showing in their<lb>
turn how little they knew of the real trials of the<lb>
women whom they longed to serve, how very narrow a<lb>
sphere of usefulness they were fitted for in spite of<lb>
<pb n="426">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-437">

<figdesc>Page 426.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
culture and intelligence, and how rich they were in generous<lb>
theories, how poor in practical methods of relief.</p>
<p>One accomplished creature with learning radiating<lb>
from every pore, delivered a charming little essay on<lb>
the strong-minded women of antiquity; then, taking<lb>
labor into the region of art, painted delightful pictures<lb>
of the time when all would work harmoniously together<lb>
in an Ideal Republic, where each did the task she liked,<lb>
and was paid for it in liberty, equality, and fraternity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately she talked over the heads of her audience,<lb>
and it was like telling fairy tales to hungry children<lb>
to describe Aspasia discussing Greek politics with<lb>
Pericles and Plato reposing upon ivory couches, or<lb>
Hypatia modestly delivering philosophical lectures to<lb>
young men behind a Tyrian purple curtain; and the<lb>
Ideal Republic met with little favor from anxious seamstresses,<lb>
type-setters, and shop-girls, who said ungratefully<lb>
among themselves, &ldquo;That 's all very pretty, but I<lb>
don't see how it 's going to better wages among us<lb>
<hi rend="italics">now.</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another eloquent sister gave them a political oration<lb>
which fired the revolutionary blood in their veins,<lb>
and made them eager to rush to the State-house <hi rend="italics">en<lb>
masse,</hi> and demand the ballot before one-half of them<lb>
were quite clear what it meant, and the other half were<lb>
as unfit for it as any ignorant Patrick bribed with a<lb>
dollar and a sup of whiskey.</p>
<p>A third well-wisher quenched their ardor like a wet<lb>
blanket, by reading reports of sundry labor reforms in<lb>
foreign parts; most interesting, but made entirely futile<lb>
by differences of climate, needs, and customs. She<lb>
closed with a cheerful budget of statistics, giving the<lb>
<pb n="427">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-438">

<figdesc>Page 427.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
exact number of needle-women who had starved, gone<lb>
mad, or committed suicide during the past year; the<lb>
enormous profits wrung by capitalists from the blood<lb>
and muscles of their employ&eacute;s; and the alarming increase<lb>
in the cost of living, which was about to plunge<lb>
the nation into debt and famine, if not destruction<lb>
generally.</p>
<p>When she sat down despair was visible on many<lb>
countenances, and immediate starvation seemed to be<lb>
waiting at the door to clutch them as they went out;<lb>
for the impressible creatures believed every word and<lb>
saw no salvation anywhere.</p>
<p>Christie had listened intently to all this; had admired,<lb>
regretted, or condemned as each spoke; and felt a steadily<lb>
increasing sympathy for all, and a strong desire to<lb>
bring the helpers and the helped into truer relations<lb>
with each other.</p>
<p>The dear ladies were so earnest, so hopeful, and so<lb>
unpractically benevolent, that it grieved her to see so<lb>
much breath wasted, so much good-will astray; while<lb>
the expectant, despondent, or excited faces of the workwomen<lb>
touched her heart; for well she knew how much<lb>
they needed help, how eager they were for light, how<lb>
ready to be led if some one would only show a possible<lb>
way.</p>
<p>As the statistical extinguisher retired, beaming with<lb>
satisfaction at having added her mite to the good cause,<lb>
a sudden and uncontrollable impulse moved Christie to<lb>
rise in her place and ask leave to speak. It was readily<lb>
granted, and a little stir of interest greeted her; for she<lb>
was known to many as Mr. Power's friend, David Sterling's<lb>
wife, or an army nurse who had done well.<lb>
<pb n="428">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-439">

<figdesc>Page 428.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
Whispers circulated quickly, and faces brightened as they<lb>
turned toward her; for she had a helpful look, and her<lb>
first words pleased them. When the president invited<lb>
her to the platform she paused on the lowest step, saying<lb>
with an expressive look and gesture:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am better here, thank you; for I have been and<lb>
mean to be a working-woman all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; cried a stout matron in a gay bonnet,<lb>
and the rest indorsed the sentiment with a hearty<lb>
round. Then they were very still, and then in a clear,<lb>
steady voice, with the sympathetic undertone to it that<lb>
is so magical in its effect, Christie made her first speech<lb>
in public since she left the stage.</p>
<p>That early training stood her in good stead now,<lb>
giving her self-possession, power of voice, and ease of<lb>
gesture; while the purpose at her heart lent her the sort<lb>
of simple eloquence that touches, persuades, and convinces<lb>
better than logic, flattery, or oratory.</p>
<p>What she said she hardly knew: words came faster<lb>
than she could utter them, thoughts pressed upon her,<lb>
and all the lessons of her life rose vividly before her to<lb>
give weight to her arguments, value to her counsel, and<lb>
the force of truth to every sentence she uttered. She<lb>
had known so many of the same trials, troubles, and<lb>
temptations that she could speak understandingly of<lb>
them; and, better still, she had conquered or outlived<lb>
so many of them, that she could not only pity but help<lb>
others to do as she had done. Having found in labor<lb>
her best teacher, comforter, and friend, she could tell<lb>
those who listened that, no matter how hard or humble<lb>
the task at the beginning, if faithfully and bravely performed,<lb>
it would surely prove a stepping-stone to<lb>
<pb n="429">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-440">

<figdesc>Page 429.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
something better, and with each honest effort they were<lb>
fitting themselves for the nobler labor, and larger<lb>
liberty God meant them to enjoy.</p>
<p>The women felt that this speaker was one of them;<lb>
for the same lines were on her face that they saw on<lb>
their own, her hands were no fine lady's hands, her<lb>
dress plainer than some of theirs, her speech simple<lb>
enough for all to understand; cheerful, comforting, and<lb>
full of practical suggestion, illustrations out of their<lb>
own experience, and a spirit of companionship that<lb>
uplifted their despondent hearts.</p>
<p>Yet more impressive than any thing she said was the<lb>
subtle magnetism of character, for that has a universal<lb>
language which all can understand. They saw and felt<lb>
that a genuine woman stood down there among them<lb>
like a sister, ready with head, heart, and hand to help<lb>
them help themselves; not offering pity as an alms, but<lb>
justice as a right. Hardship and sorrow, long effort<lb>
and late-won reward had been hers they knew; wifehood,<lb>
motherhood, and widowhood brought her very<lb>
near to them; and behind her was the background of<lb>
an earnest life, against which this figure with health on<lb>
the cheeks, hope in the eyes, courage on the lips, and<lb>
the ardor of a wide benevolence warming the whole<lb>
countenance stood out full of unconscious dignity and<lb>
beauty; an example to comfort, touch, and inspire<lb>
them.</p>
<p>It was not a long speech, and in it there was no<lb>
learning, no statistics, and no politics; yet it was the<lb>
speech of the evening, and when it was over no one<lb>
else seemed to have any thing to say. As the meeting<lb>
broke up Christie's hand was shaken by many<lb>
<pb n="430">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-441">

<figdesc>Page 430.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
roughened by the needle, stained with printer's ink, or hard<lb>
with humbler toil; many faces smiled gratefully at her,<lb>
and many voices thanked her heartily. But sweeter<lb>
than any applause were the words of one woman who<lb>
grasped her hand, and whispered with wet eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew your blessed husband; he was very good to<lb>
me, and I 've been thanking the Lord he had such a<lb>
wife for his reward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie was thinking of all this as she sat alone that<lb>
day, and asking herself if she should go on; for the<lb>
ladies had been as grateful as the women; had begged<lb>
her to come and speak again, saying they needed just<lb>
such a mediator to bridge across the space that now<lb>
divided them from those they wished to serve. She<lb>
certainly seemed fitted to act as interpreter between<lb>
the two classes; for, from the gentleman her father she<lb>
had inherited the fine instincts, gracious manners, and<lb>
unblemished name of an old and honorable race; from<lb>
the farmer's daughter, her mother, came the equally<lb>
valuable dower of practical virtues, a sturdy love of<lb>
independence, and great respect for the skill and courage<lb>
that can win it.</p>
<p>Such women were much needed and are not always<lb>
easy to find; for even in democratic America the hand<lb>
that earns its daily bread must wear some talent, name,<lb>
or honor as an ornament, before it is very cordially<lb>
shaken by those that wear white gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this is the task my life has been fitting me<lb>
for,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A great and noble one which I should<lb>
be proud to accept and help accomplish if I can. Others<lb>
have finished the emancipation work and done it splendidly,<lb>
even at the cost of all this blood and sorrow. I<lb>
<pb n="431">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-442">

<figdesc>Page 431.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
came too late to do any thing but give my husband<lb>
and behold the glorious end. This new task seems to<lb>
offer me the chance of being among the pioneers, to<lb>
do the hard work, share the persecution, and help lay<lb>
the foundation of a new emancipation whose happy<lb>
success I may never see. Yet I had rather be remembered<lb>
as those brave beginners are, though many of<lb>
them missed the triumph, than as the late comers will<lb>
be, who only beat the drums and wave the banners<lb>
when the victory is won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the gate creaked on its hinges, a step<lb>
sounded in the porch, and little Ruth ran in to say in<lb>
an audible whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It 's a lady, mamma, a very pretty lady: can you<lb>
see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, ask her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rustle of sweeping silks through the<lb>
narrow hall, a vision of a very lovely woman in the<lb>
door-way, and two daintily gloved hands were extended<lb>
as an eager voice asked: &ldquo;Dearest Christie, don't you<lb>
remember Bella Carrol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie did remember, and had her in her arms directly,<lb>
utterly regardless of the imminent destruction of<lb>
a marvellous hat, or the bad effect of tears on violet<lb>
ribbons. Presently they were sitting close together,<lb>
talking with April faces, and telling their stories as<lb>
women must when they meet after the lapse of years.<lb>
A few letters had passed between them, but Bella had<lb>
been abroad, and Christie too busy living her life to<lb>
have much time to write about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother, Bella? how is she, and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still with Augustine, and he you know is<lb>

melancholy mad: very quiet, very patient, and very kind<lb>
to every one but himself. His penances for the sins<lb>
of his race would soon kill him if mother was not<lb>
there to watch over him. And her penance is never<lb>
to leave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, don't tell me any more; it is too sad.<lb>
Talk of yourself and Harry. Now you smile, so I 'm<lb>
sure all is well with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank heaven! Christie, I do believe fate<lb>
means to spare us as dear old Dr. Shirley said. I never<lb>
can be gay again, but I keep as cheerful and busy as<lb>
I can, for Harry's sake, and he does the same for mine.<lb>
We shall always be together, and all in all to one<lb>
another, for we can never marry and have homes apart<lb>
you know. We have wandered over the face of the<lb>
earth for several years, and now we mean to settle<lb>
down and be as happy and as useful as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's brave! I am so glad to hear it, and so truly<lb>
thankful it is possible. But tell me, Bella, what Harry<lb>
means to do? You spoke in one of your first letters<lb>
of his being hard at work studying medicine. Is that<lb>
to be his profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I don't know what made him choose it, unless<lb>
it was the hope that he might spare other families from<lb>
a curse like ours, or lighten it if it came. After<lb>
Helen's death he was a changed creature; no longer a<lb>
wild boy, but a man. I told him what you said to me,<lb>
and it gave him hope. Dr. Shirley confirmed it as far<lb>
as he dared; and Hal resolved to make the most of his<lb>
one chance by interesting himself in some absorbing<lb>
study, and leaving no room for fear, no time for dangerous<lb>
recollections. I was so glad, and mother so<lb>

<figdesc>Page 433.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="19 BB">
comforted, for we both feared that sad trouble would<lb>
destroy him. He studied hard, got on splendidly,<lb>
and then went abroad to finish off. I went with him;<lb>
for poor August was past hope, and mamma would<lb>
not let me help her. The doctor said it was best for<lb>
me to be away, and excellent for Hal to have me with<lb>
him, to cheer him up, and keep him steady with a<lb>
little responsibility. We have been happy together<lb>
in spite of our trouble, he in his profession, and I in<lb>
him; now he is ready, so we have come home, and<lb>
now the hardest part begins for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, Bella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has his work and loves it: I have nothing<lb>
after my duty to him is done. I find I 've lost my<lb>
taste for the old pleasures and pursuits, and though<lb>
I have tried more sober, solid ones, there still remains<lb>
much time to hang heavy on my hands, and such an<lb>
empty place in my heart, that even Harry's love cannot<lb>
fill it. I 'm afraid I shall get melancholy, &mdash; that<lb>
is the beginning of the end for us, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bella spoke the light died out of her eyes, and<lb>
they grew despairing with the gloom of a tragic memory.<lb>
Christie drew the beautiful, pathetic face down<lb>
upon her bosom, longing to comfort, yet feeling very<lb>
powerless to lighten Bella's burden.</p>
<p>But Christie's little daughter did it for her. Ruth<lb>
had been standing near regarding the &ldquo;pretty lady,&rdquo;<lb>
with as much wonder and admiration as if she thought<lb>
her a fairy princess, who might vanish before she got a<lb>
good look at her. Divining with a child's quick instinct<lb>
that the princess was in trouble, Ruth flew into the<lb>
porch, caught up her latest and dearest treasure, and<lb>
<pb n="434">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-445">

<figdesc>Page 434.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
presented it as a sure consolation, with such sweet<lb>
good-will, that Bella could not refuse, although it was<lb>
only a fuzzy caterpillar in a little box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it to you because it is my nicest one and just<lb>
ready to spin up. Do you like pussy-pillars, and know<lb>
how they do it?&rdquo; asked Ruth, emboldened by the kiss<lb>
she got in return for her offering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it, darling,&rdquo; and Bella could not<lb>
help smiling, as the child fixed her great eyes upon her,<lb>
and told her little story with such earnestness, that she<lb>
was breathless by the time she ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first they are only grubs you know, and stay<lb>
down in the earth; then they are like this, nice and<lb>
downy and humpy, when they walk; and when it 's<lb>
time they spin up and go to sleep. It 's all dark in<lb>
their little beds, and they don't know what may happen<lb>
to 'em; but they are not afraid 'cause God takes care<lb>
of 'em. So they wait and don't fret, and when it 's<lb>
right for 'em they come out splendid butterflies, all<lb>
beautiful and shining like your gown. They are happy<lb>
then, and fly away to eat honey, and live in the air,<lb>
and never be creeping worms any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's a pretty lesson for me,&rdquo; said Bella softly, &ldquo;I<lb>
accept and thank you for it, little teacher; I 'll try to<lb>
be a patient `pussy-pillar' though it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> dark, and I<lb>
don't know what may happen to me; and I 'll wait<lb>
hopefully till it 's time to float away a happy butterfly.&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get the friend some flowers, the gayest<lb>
and sweetest you can find, Pansy,&rdquo; said Christie, and,<lb>
as the child ran off, she added to her friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must think of something pleasant for you<lb>
<pb n="435">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-446">

<figdesc>Page 435.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
to do. It may take a little time, but I know we<lb>
shall find your niche if we give our minds to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 's one reason why I came. I heard some<lb>
friends of mine talking about you yesterday, and they<lb>
seemed to think you were equal to any thing in the<lb>
way of good works. Charity is the usual refuge for<lb>
people like me, so I wish to try it. I don't mind<lb>
doing or seeing sad or disagreeable things, if it only<lb>
fills up my life and helps me to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will help more by giving of your abundance<lb>
to those who know how to dispense it wisely, than by<lb>
trying to do it yourself, my dear. I never advise pretty<lb>
creatures like you to tuck up their silk gowns and go<lb>
down into the sloughs with alms for the poor, who<lb>
don't like it any better than you do, and so much pity<lb>
and money are wasted in sentimental charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose you can find plenty of work in your<lb>
own class; for, if you will allow me to say it, they need<lb>
help quite as much as the paupers, though in a very<lb>
different way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean I 'm to be strong-minded, to cry<lb>
aloud and spare not, to denounce their iniquities, and<lb>
demand their money or their lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Bella, that's personal; for I made my first<lb>
speech a night or two ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you did, and I wish I 'd heard it. I 'd make<lb>
mine to-night if I could do it half as well as I 'm told<lb>
you did,&rdquo; interrupted Bella, clapping her hands with a<lb>
face full of approval.</p>
<p>But Christie was in earnest, and produced her new<lb>
project with all speed.</p>
<pb n="436">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-447">

<figdesc>Page 436.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to try a little experiment for me, and<lb>
if it succeeds you shall have all the glory; I 've been<lb>
waiting for some one to undertake it, and I fancy you<lb>
are the woman. Not every one could attempt it; for it<lb>
needs wealth and position, beauty and accomplishments,<lb>
much tact, and more than all a heart that has not been<lb>
spoilt by the world, but taught through sorrow how to<lb>
value and use life well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie, what is it? this experiment that needs so<lb>
much, and yet which you think me capable of trying?&rdquo;<lb>
asked Bella, interested and flattered by this opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to set a new fashion: you know you<lb>
can set almost any you choose in your own circle; for<lb>
people are very like sheep, and will follow their leader<lb>
if it happens to be one they fancy. I don't ask you to<lb>
be a De Sta&euml;l, and have a brilliant <hi rend="italics">salon:</hi> I only want<lb>
you to provide employment and pleasure for others<lb>
like yourself, who now are dying of frivolity or <hi rend="italics">ennui.</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love to do that if I could. Tell me how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, I want you to make Harry's home as<lb>
beautiful and attractive as you can; to keep all the<lb>
elegance and refinement of former times, and to add to<lb>
it a new charm by setting the fashion of common sense.<lb>
Invite all the old friends, and as many new ones as you<lb>
choose; but have it understood that they are to come<lb>
as intelligent men and women, not as pleasure-hunting<lb>
beaux and belles; give them conversation instead of<lb>
gossip; less food for the body and more for the mind;<lb>
the healthy stimulus of the nobler pleasures they can<lb>
command, instead of the harmful excitements of present<lb>
dissipation. In short, show them the sort of society<lb>
we need more of, and might so easily have if those who<lb>
<pb n="437">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-448">

<figdesc>Page 437.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
possess the means of culture cared for the best sort,<lb>
and took pride in acquiring it. Do you understand,<lb>
Bella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it 's a great undertaking, and you could<lb>
do it better than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, no! I haven't a single qualification for<lb>
it but the will to have it done. I 'm `strong-minded,'<lb>
a radical, and a reformer. I 've done all sorts of dreadful<lb>
things to get my living, and I have neither youth,<lb>
beauty, talent, or position to back me up; so I should<lb>
only be politely ignored if I tried the experiment myself.<lb>
I don't want you to break out and announce<lb>
your purpose with a flourish; or try to reform society<lb>
at large, but I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> want you to devote yourself and your<lb>
advantages to quietly insinuating a better state of<lb>
things into one little circle. The very fact of your own<lb>
want, your own weariness, proves how much such a reform<lb>
is needed. There are so many fine young women<lb>
longing for something to fill up the empty places that<lb>
come when the first flush of youth is over, and the<lb>
serious side of life appears; so many promising young<lb>
men learning to conceal or condemn the high ideals<lb>
and the noble purposes they started with, because<lb>
they find no welcome for them. You might help both<lb>
by simply creating a purer atmosphere for them to<lb>
breathe, sunshine to foster instead of frost to nip their<lb>
good aspirations, and so, even if you planted no seed,<lb>
you might encourage a timid sprout or two that would<lb>
one day be a lovely flower or a grand tree all would<lb>
admire and enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Christie ended with the figure suggested by her<lb>
favorite work, Bella said after a thoughtful pause:</p>
<pb n="438">
<p>
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-449">

<figdesc>Page 438.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;But few of the women I know can talk about any<lb>
thing but servants, dress, and gossip. Here and there<lb>
one knows something of music, art, or literature; but the<lb>
superior ones are not favorites with the larger class of<lb>
gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let the superior women cultivate the smaller<lb>
class of men who do admire intelligence as well as<lb>
beauty. There are plenty of them, and you had better<lb>
introduce a few as samples, though their coats may not<lb>
be of the finest broadcloth, nor their fathers `solid<lb>
men.' Women lead in society, and when men find<lb>
that they can not only dress with taste, but talk with<lb>
sense, the lords of creation will be glad to drop mere<lb>
twaddle and converse as with their equals. Bless<lb>
my heart!&rdquo; cried Christie, walking about the room<lb>
as if she had mounted her hobby, and was off for<lb>
a canter, &ldquo;how people can go on in such an idiotic<lb>
fashion passes my understanding. Why keep up an<lb>
endless clatter about gowns and dinners, your neighbors'<lb>
affairs, and your own aches, when there is a world<lb>
full of grand questions to settle, lovely things to see,<lb>
wise things to study, and noble things to imitate.<lb>
Bella, you <hi rend="italics">must</hi> try the experiment, and be the queen<lb>
of a better society than any you can reign over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks inviting, and I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> try it with you to help<lb>
me. I know Harry would like it, and I 'll get him to<lb>
recommend it to his patients. If he is as successful<lb>
here as elsewhere they will swallow any dose he orders;<lb>
for he knows how to manage people wonderfully well.<lb>
He prescribed a silk dress to a despondent, dowdy<lb>
patient once, telling her the electricity of silk was<lb>
good for her nerves: she obeyed, and when well<lb>
<pb n="439">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-450">

<figdesc>Page 439.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
dressed felt so much better that she bestirred herself<lb>
generally and recovered; but to this day she sings the<lb>
praises of Dr. Carrol's electric cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bella was laughing gaily as she spoke, and so was<lb>
Christie as she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's just what I want you to do with <hi rend="italics">your</hi><lb>
patients. Dress up their minds in their best; get them<lb>
out into the air; and cure their ills by the magnetism<lb>
of more active, earnest lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked over the new plan with increasing interest;<lb>
for Christie did not mean that Bella should be<lb>
one of the brilliant women who shine for a little while,<lb>
and then go out like a firework. And Bella felt as if<lb>
she had found something to do in her own sphere, a<lb>
sort of charity she was fitted for, and with it a pleasant<lb>
sense of power to give it zest.</p>
<p>When Letty and her mother came in, they found a<lb>
much happier looking guest than the one Christie had<lb>
welcomed an hour before. Scarcely had she introduced<lb>
them when voices in the lane made all look up to see<lb>
old Hepsey and Mrs. Wilkins approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more of my dear friends, Bella: a fugitive slave<lb>
and a laundress. One has saved scores of her own people,<lb>
and is my pet heroine. The other has the bravest,<lb>
cheeriest soul I know, and is my private oracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of Christie's mouth<lb>
when in they came; Hepsey's black face shining with<lb>
affection, and Mrs. Wilkins as usual running over with<lb>
kind words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear creeter, the best of wishes and no end of<lb>
happy birthdays. There 's a triflin' keepsake; tuck it<lb>
away, and look at it byme by. Mis' Sterlin', I 'm<lb>
<pb n="440">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-451">

<figdesc>Page 440.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
proper glad to see you lookin' so well. Aunt Letty,<lb>
how 's that darlin' child? I ain't the pleasure of<lb>
your acquaintance, Miss, but I 'm pleased to see you.<lb>
The children all sent love, likewise Lisha, whose bones<lb>
is better sense I tried the camfire and red flannel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they settled down like a flock of birds of various<lb>
plumage and power of song, but all amicably disposed,<lb>
and ready to peck socially at any topic which<lb>
might turn up.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins started one by exclaiming as she &ldquo;laid<lb>
off&rdquo; her bonnet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive, there 's a new picter! Ain't it beautiful?&rdquo;<lb>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Fletcher brought it this morning. A great<lb>
artist painted it for him, and he gave it to me in a way<lb>
that added much to its value,&rdquo; answered Christie, with<lb>
both gratitude and affection in her face; for she was a<lb>
woman who could change a lover to a friend, and keep<lb>
him all her life.</p>
<p>It was a quaint and lovely picture of Mr. Greatheart,<lb>
leading the fugitives from the City of Destruction. A<lb>
dark wood lay behind; a wide river rolled before;<lb>
Mercy and Christiana pressed close to their faithful<lb>
guide, who went down the rough and narrow path bearing<lb>
a cross-hilted sword in his right hand, and holding<lb>
a sleeping baby with the left. The sun was just rising,<lb>
and a long ray made a bright path athwart the river,<lb>
turned Greatheart's dinted armor to gold, and shone<lb>
into the brave and tender face that seemed to look<lb>
beyond the sunrise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There 's just a hint of Davy in it that is very comforting<lb>
to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sterling, as she laid her old<lb>
<pb n="441">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-452">

<figdesc>Page 441.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
<milestn unit="collation" n="19*">
hands softly together, and looked up with her devout<lb>
eyes full of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dem women oughter bin black,&rdquo; murmured Hepsey,<lb>
tearfully; for she considered David worthy of a place<lb>
with old John Brown and Colonel Shaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child looks like Pansy, we all think,&rdquo; added<lb>
Letty, as the little girl brought her nosegay for Aunty<lb>
to tie up prettily.</p>
<p>Christie said nothing, because she felt too much; and<lb>
Bella was also silent because she knew too little. But<lb>
Mrs. Wilkins with her kindly tact changed the subject<lb>
before it grew painful, and asked with sudden interest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When be you a goin' to hold forth agin, Christie?<lb>
Jest let me know beforehand, and I 'll wear my old<lb>
gloves: I tore my best ones all to rags clappin' of you;<lb>
it was so extra good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't deserve any credit for the speech, because<lb>
it spoke itself, and I couldn't help it. I had no thought<lb>
of such a thing till it came over me all at once, and I<lb>
was up before I knew it. I 'm truly glad you liked it,<lb>
but I shall never make another, unless you think I 'd<lb>
better. You know I always ask your advice, and what<lb>
is more remarkable usually take it,&rdquo; said Christie, glad<lb>
to consult her oracle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn't you better rest a little before you begin any<lb>
new task, my daughter? You have done so much<lb>
these last years you must be tired,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs.<lb>
Sterling, with a look of tender anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I work for two, mother,&rdquo; answered Christie,<lb>
with the clear, sweet expression her face always<lb>
wore when she spoke of David. &ldquo;I am not tired yet:<lb>
I hope I never shall be, for without my work I should<lb>
<pb n="442">
<eaffig volid="eaf445T" entity="f445-453">

<figdesc>Page 442.</figdesc>
</eaffig>
fall into despair or <hi rend="italics">ennui.</hi> There is so much to be done,<lb>
and it is so delightful to help do it, that I never mean<lb>
to fold my hands till they are useless. I owe all I can<lb>
do, for in labor, and the efforts and experiences that<lb>
grew out of it, I have found independence, education,<lb>
happiness, and religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear, you are ready to help other folks<lb>
into the same blessed state, and it 's your duty to do<lb>
it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wilkins, her keen eyes full of sympathy<lb>
and commendation as they rested on Christie's cheerful,<lb>
earnest face. &ldquo;Ef the sperrit moves you to speak, up<lb>
and do it without no misgivin's. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> think it was a special<lb>
leadin' that night, and I hope you 'll foller, for it ain't<lb>
every one that can make folks laugh and cry with a<lb>
few plain words that go right to a body's heart and stop<lb>
there real comfortable and fillin'. I guess this is your<lb>
next job, my dear, and you 'd better ketch hold and<lb>
give it the right turn; for it 's goin' to take time, and<lb>
women ain't stood alone for so long they 'll need a sight<lb>
of boostin'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at the close of Mrs. Wilkins's<lb>
remarks; but Christie answered seriously: &ldquo;I accept<lb>
the task, and will do my share faithfully with<lb>
words or work, as shall seem best. We all need much<lb>
preparation for the good time that is coming to us, and<lb>
can get it best by trying to know and help, love and<lb>
educate one another, &mdash; as we do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an impulsive gesture Christie stretched her<lb>
hands to the friends about her, and with one accord<lb>
they laid theirs on hers, a loving league of sisters,<lb>
old and young, black and white, rich and poor, each<lb>
ready to do her part to hasten the coming of the happy<lb>
end.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; cried little Ruth, and spread her chubby<lb>
hand above the rest: a hopeful omen, seeming to<lb>
promise that the coming generation of women will not<lb>
only receive but deserve their liberty, by learning that<lb>
the greatest of God's gifts to us is the privilege of<lb>
sharing His great work.</p>
