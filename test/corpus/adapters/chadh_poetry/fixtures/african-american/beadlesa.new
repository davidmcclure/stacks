<caption r="gothic">Preface</caption>
<p><hi r="smcap">How</hi> active, longeval and fascinating, is hope; the accidents,
reverses and misfortunes of today but invigorate
it, and tomorrow it will be painting brighter goals, in
all the colors of the rainbow, or embellishing the desert, where
it faded yesterday, with the mirage. It follows but never comes
up with the horizon; and when, at the end of its cable tow, it has
reached the bourn, it is then, to many, so seductive in enchantment
that death, in the hour of its triumph, is confused by the garlands
hope wreaths upon the brow of faith.</p>
<p>Beguiled by this alluring vision, I have been seduced into
the difficult, yet pleasing labors of writing verse, a small collection
of which I am exposing to the consideration of the public, before
I have acquired the skill of a novice; who, I am sure, could have
done better, with less effort; and who will, perhaps, upon reviewng
my work, blush derisively at my poverty of thought and vagueness
of expression; such is his pleasure.</p>
<p>It is enough for me to indulge the fancy that an asylum survives
for him who is seduced by the muses, in the lenitive passions
of those, whose love for the beautiful, causes them to tolerate
its worshipers; whose affections for the esthetic, make them
partial to its vassals and whose loftiness of character and charity
of spirit impel them to be lenient where they might be rash, and
just where they might yield to malice; and who, in the exercise
of these happy virtues, do not forget that the daisy comes as
sweet from the fallow as the rose from the garden.</p>
<p>In selecting a name for this poor work, I have, perchance,
done violence to the sensitive feelings of many zealous partizans
of the art of composition, who have, with the usurpation common
to squatter sovereigns, fenced off the domain of poesy, as an
exclusive sporting ground for themselves, where trespassers, such
as I am, are commanded to &ldquo;Keep off the grass.&rdquo; To all such I
would like to say that the name is not chosen because the composition,
for which it stands, is metrical; but rather because I am
a member of that unhappy race of people which are treated as
<pb n="iv">
alien enemies in the land of their nativity, and the victim of that
tyrannous public opinion which makes in them and me, what were
commendable in others, a bar to advancement; and since this
inclement public opinion has barred us from pursuing those civic
pursuits that distinguish the civilian from the savage, and the
savage from the brute, may I not call this little volume &ldquo;Lyrics of
the Under World&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The piece, &ldquo;My Country,&rdquo; is but a fanciful flight of hope from
conditions that are to what ought to be the scope of one's environment
in a country whose underlying principles are said to be,
&ldquo;Equal rights to all, special benefits to none.&rdquo; And, since &ldquo;My
Country&rdquo; is a creature of fancy, may it not be palmed off on the
uninitiated as verse, if not poetry? Those of my fellows who
upbraid me for indulging the fancy, together with those who would
eliminate me under the doctrine, &ldquo;This is a white man's country,&rdquo;
will not, I hope, further deprive me from enjoying through the
imagination what seems to be impossible as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>If these truths are not self&hyphen;evident, but false: &ldquo;That all men
are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights; that among these rights are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness,&rdquo; let me at least hold them among the
things imaginable. I cannot abandon the position that this is my
country.</p>
<p>There is, I think, enough in the overt acts of some of the
worshipers of the idol, Color, to justify the &ldquo;Lines to Caste,&rdquo;
until a master comes, who will give the subject its proper treatment.
&ldquo;The Jaunt&rdquo; is mere jargon, thrown in to take the place of
&ldquo;The Black Knight,&rdquo; a poem I had intended for this collection,
but which I prefer not to publish at this time. I may say, however,
that in writing &ldquo;The Jaunt&rdquo; I was trying to build a continued
discourse in sonnets, and failed utterly with the soliloquy of age.</p>
<p>Of the other subjects of this collection I prefer to say nothing,
since the reader, a better judge of their merits and demerits
than I am, will render a decision for hlmself.</p>
<p>I would like, however, to thank my two friends, Dr. W. A.
Scott, the publisher, and Hon. W. E. Mollison, who have condescended,
the one to publish the book and the other to write its
introduction, for the encouragement they gave me in my labors.
<pb n="v">
They are the only two college graduates, among my many acquaintances,
who did not think it humiliating to themselves to
recognize me, whom abject poverty during my youth and early
manhood deprived of the benefits of school training.</p>
<p>As to the illustrations, I give &ldquo;Sam in Sleepy Corner&rdquo; the
place of honor, because he is an old companion of mine who
used to sit with me while I munched my food on the curb, or was
kicked into the gutter by the haughty and proud for intruding upon
the public thoroughfare. And yet I am free to say that there is
as much happiness upon the curb as there is in the palace, and
that I haven't had a happy day since I left it. But&mdash;
<l>I've heard so much of poesy, of art,</l>
<l>And mystic things, the plumed wings of thought,</l>
<l>Which none but genius has; none but genius ought</l>
<l>Prime for gay fancy's flight, of awe I start</l>
<l>Amazed! yet motive moved, by buoyant heart</l>
<l>I'd labor where the nobler souls have wrought;</l>
<l>But when I would I'm told, for me 'tis naught</l>
<l>To strive, since neither muse nor art takes part</l>
<l>Where spirit 's dull; yet may I not, beguiled</l>
<l>By no incentive but the soul's flood swell,</l>
<l>Aheave like high tides when the seas run wild,</l>
<l>Awake a passion note, since that strange spell,</l>
<l>Love and not art's the suasive soul of song,</l>
<l>Genius, but labor toiling late and long.</l></p>
<p>I am indebted to my son, Richard Henry Beadle, for the
photographic illustrations, and to Mr. Boon for the cartoon, that
appear in this book.</p>
<p>I entertain for the children of my fancy a fond solicitude, I
part with them with a feeling akin to pain lest they will not give
you as much pleasure, dear reader, in their perusal as I found in
their creation.</p>
<p>If it were not out of place for me to commend them to you I
would like to say a good word for Eulelia, Alice, Iona, Sam and
the others. As it is I but consign them to your consideration
without a word further than subscribing myself,</p>
<signed>YOURS truly, S. A. BEADLE.</signed></preface>

<caption r="gothic">Introduction</caption>
<p><hi r="smcap">It</hi> was Abraham Lincoln who said, &ldquo;God Almighty must have
loved the common people, or he would not have made so
many of them.&rdquo; It is not often that the bard makes any
effort to sing the songs of the lowly. The poet is prone to pay
court to the gods who dwell upon Olympus, rather than the delvers
in mines or the fellers of the forest. The author of this book has
seen lifein all of its phases. From the humblest of beginnings, he
has reached heights not dreamed of in his boyhood; has measured
swords with the best and master spirits of his age, and has held
his own among them. His heart must beat in unison with the
sufferings as well as the hopes and aspirations for such as are
not &ldquo;brother to the ox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of these poems voice for the first time the dreams
and hopes of this Under&hyphen;World; many of them have in the lines
glint of real genius, and while our author has not ridden Pegassus
like the Centaur, even Jupiter has nodded at times. Our author's
contribution to the literature of his people and his time will be
more appreciated as the years roll by.</p>
<p>He has placed all of us under lasting obligations to him for
having opened these new vistas into the hearts and souls of the
simple folk whose songs he sings with such consummate grace
and simple beauty.</p>
<p>Mr. Beadle has written many charming verses in earlier
years, many of them show sparks of poetic fire&mdash;but none come
up to the sustained height reached and kept in &ldquo;Lyrics of the
Under World.&rdquo;</p>

</l><l ln="41      ">&indent;&indent;So dire, so fell, but strong my prison
</l><l ln="42      ">&indent;&indent;Hope to escape it is derision.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="43      ">And yet there often comes to me,
</l><l ln="44      ">&indent;I know not how, from whence nor where;
</l><l ln="45      ">But comes the thought perpetually,
</l><l ln="46      ">&indent;That justice is not deft to prayer.
</l><l ln="47      ">&indent;&indent;Though it seems barren, yet for me,
</l><l ln="48      ">&indent;&indent;With good is pregnant destiny.</l></stanza>
<pb n="16">
<stanza><l ln="49      ">Then wherefore should my soul repine,
</l><l ln="50      ">&indent;Why be disconsolate and sad;
</l><l ln="51      ">All things are well in Fate's design,
</l><l ln="52      ">&indent;Nor great, nor small, nor good, nor bad
</l><l ln="53      ">&indent;&indent;Has aught to boast of o'er the clay,

</l><l ln="56      ">&indent;The haughty proud, would press you hard.
</l><l ln="57      ">Have they so far subdued the shroud,
</l><l ln="58      ">&indent;That clay can now assume the God?
</l><l ln="59      ">&indent;&indent;Whate'er its form, or hue, or clan,

<stanza><l ln="67      ">Who is so great among mankind,
</l><l ln="68      ">&indent;His infancy knew not the womb;
</l><l ln="69      ">And, coming thence, still is not blind,
</l><l ln="70      ">&indent;To wombed life, as he the tomb

</l><l ln="72      ">&indent;Whate'er his prowess, clan or race.</l></stanza>
<pb n="17">
<stanza><l ln="73      ">And who's so small that, should he fall,

</l><l ln="75      ">Though he be spurned by kings, and all
</l><l ln="76      ">&indent;Who frown men down with visage grim,
</l><l ln="77      ">&indent;&indent;Methinks he'll be as grand in clay
</l><l ln="78      ">&indent;&indent;As he who tortures him today.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="79      ">I know not why I live or die,
</l><l ln="80      ">&indent;Nor why of me the Lord should reck,
</l><l ln="81      ">When like the bruis'd reed prone I lie,
</l><l ln="82      ">&indent;The tyrant's heel upon my neck;
</l><l ln="83      ">&indent;&indent;I simply know that Caste is blind,
</l><l ln="84      ">&indent;&indent;And that its hope is vicious mind.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="85      ">Because God loves He doth chastise,
</l><l ln="86      ">&indent;And makes another race the rod;
</l><l ln="87      ">Then let the chasten race be wise
</l><l ln="88      ">&indent;And know the lash is not the God;
</l><l ln="89      ">&indent;&indent;'Tis not the rod's; chastisement is
</l><l ln="90      ">&indent;&indent;Eternally and justly His.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="91      ">We have forgot our own household,
</l><l ln="92      ">&indent;To take our tribute to the strong&mdash;
</l><l ln="93      ">The willing vassal, young or old,
</l><l ln="94      ">&indent;Deserve chastisement late and long;
</l><l ln="95      ">&indent;&indent;And ours is but the well&hyphen;earned hell

<stanza><l ln="21      ">But the wayward, something wiser than your wife, plays on your whim,
</l><l ln="22      ">Veneering all your failures with the glow of triumph's glim,
</l><l ln="23      ">E'er sees in you some greatness, never finds in you a fault,
</l><l ln="24      ">You're every whit par excellence, though brimming full of malt.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="25      ">We cannot help but like them if we dared do otherwise,
</l><l ln="26      ">Their sympathy and fervor would their meaner selves disguise;
</l><l ln="27      ">So far transcend the nagging of our double&hyphen;tongued wives,
</l><l ln="28      ">The nuptials were but prose beside the lyric of our lives.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="29      ">With naggers, life is painful if they do not roar and snort
</l><l ln="30      ">With frenzy and with fury, and the trespass of retort;
</l><l ln="31      ">And club men are so constant in their social thought and air,
</l><l ln="32      ">You just forget deception is the glory reigning there.</l></stanza>
<pb n="37">
<stanza><l ln="33      ">Men know 'tis wrong to wander, that to dissipate is sin,
</l><l ln="34      ">That the dazzle of the harem is the web the evil spin,
</l><l ln="35      ">To inveigle and to plunder, and to deprivate and spoil,
</l><l ln="36      ">But to the flings of nagging wives they make a splendid foil.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="37      ">You may moralize and blame them, you may put them under ban,
</l><l ln="38      ">And scourge them out of Eden, from Beersheba unto Dan;
</l><l ln="39      ">But they'll fly the track at intervals and seek the Shady Side,
</l><l ln="40      ">Though naggers all were angels and with deities allied.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="41      ">A lodge within the fastness of the desert waste, or wild,
</l><l ln="42      ">Is better than the castle hall and palace courts defiled
</l><l ln="43      ">By wielding of the epigram and reign of repartee,
</l><l ln="44      ">Where the housewife's pride and glory is to nag and disagree.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="45      ">Again, take her whose virginhood bloomed on the Sunny Side,
</l><l ln="46      ">Who had no whim unfavored and no wish not satisfied;
</l><l ln="47      ">But loved while young, and loving, took the first mad leap and lost.
</l><l ln="48      ">And see what door will open, and what lord will be her host.</l></stanza>
<pb n="38">
<stanza><l ln="49      ">If she, perchance a mother, friend, should visit you today,
</l><l ln="50      ">Are you not sure you'd drive her and her infant child away;
</l><l ln="51      ">What matron of the sisterhood of elite folks above
</l><l ln="52      ">Would comfort give a wanderer from the sunny haunts of love?</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="53      ">Except, perhaps, they might take him whose purse has golden strings;
</l><l ln="54      ">Or him who has a title to estates and fees and things;
</l><l ln="55      ">Aye! truly they might lord the man who dragged the maiden down,
</l><l ln="56      ">And let him take his pick of hearts from daughters of their own.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="57      ">But she who young in loving took the first mad leap and lost,
</l><l ln="58      ">Must wander forth hereafter, friend, a vagabond at most,
</l><l ln="59      ">Unless she seeks the Shady Side, where high&hyphen;flown hopes are furled,
</l><l ln="60      ">And take her portion and her chance with us of the Under World.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="61      ">And let her not be weary, nor in her soul cast down,
</l><l ln="62      ">We have no social tyrants here who murder with a frown;
</l><l ln="63      ">But noble men and women, too, with souls like open charts,
</l><l ln="64      ">Who take one's measure not from gold, but purposes of heart.</l></stanza></poem>

<edit>[Footnote: <bytes>1Kb</bytes>]</edit><note idref="CN010946"><p>About two miles, as the crow flies, south from Meridian, in
Lauderdale County, Mississippi, stands Mt. Barton, probably the
highest hill in East Mississippi. One can get a splendid view
of the surrounding country from this hill; and, in the early morning
or late afternoon, the beauty of the landscape viewed from
its summit is pleasing.</p>
<p>I frequently visit Mt. Barton, which I call the Heights of
Lauderdale. I can see and contemplate Meridian better from
this point, and the sweet sensations which come when the winds
play among the pines, and the absence of the din and noise of
the city, make it a happy resort for a weary mind.</p></note>

</l><l ln="5        ">For the sovereign is the people, and the people's will is law.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="6        ">The voter he is royalized, his dame's a sovereign's queen,

<stanza><l ln="11      ">And Washington, impregnable, did Freedom's glory set
</l><l ln="12      ">Above the rage of passion and beyond ambition's blow;
</l><l ln="13      ">And Lincoln died to keep it there, the honor of the West;
</l><l ln="14      ">A government of commoners, that is triumphant yet
</l><l ln="15      ">In the suffrage of the people, for the people's reign is best.</l></stanza>

<stanza><l ln="16      ">Yet Roosevelt brought us princely whims, and honor and renown;
</l><l ln="17      ">And led the Russ and Japanese to pleasant fields to peace.
</l><l ln="18      ">And sent our valiant fighting tars a spinning round the globe,
</l><l ln="19      ">And boosted up the Cabinet, and held the Congress down,
</l><l ln="20      ">And kept the trust contending with the governmental probe.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="21      ">A brilliant man of letters, he eclipsed the fourth estate,

</l><l ln="24      ">The great became his echoist, &ldquo;My policies to prate,&rdquo;
</l><l ln="25      ">And everything spectacular was left to fate and him.</l></stanza>

</l><l ln="27      ">And he is wasting dictums on the Ananias clubs,
</l><l ln="28      ">And holds in his opinion, and by all the rules of law,
</l><l ln="29      ">Apparent is presumption and self&hyphen;evident is proof,

</l><l ln="37      ">Who keeps his soul in peace and reigns o'er eighty million kings

<stanza><l ln="41      ">The President is glorious, we think he is sublime,
</l><l ln="42      ">Whene'er he represents the will of eighty million souls;
</l><l ln="43      ">A commoner of commoners, by commoners enthroned,
</l><l ln="44      ">And made the peer of all the kings of every age and clime,
</l><l ln="45      ">Whose glory none will dare despoil, and none has yet disowned.</l></stanza>
<pb n="116">
<stanza><l ln="46      ">The patriots who built the realm, have in their will decreed,
</l><l ln="47      ">The sceptre is the people's and among them shall rotate,
</l><l ln="48      ">Till home rule is immortalized in ev'ry people's reign;
</l><l ln="49      ">For royal blood's a fiction and all royalty's a creed,
</l><l ln="50      ">And suffrage of the people still the hope of state and fane.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="51      ">So here's to Mister President, and here's to Taft the man,
</l><l ln="52      ">A commoner of commoners by commoners enthroned;
</l><l ln="53      ">And here is to the commoners, my countrymen, my peers,
</l><l ln="54      ">And here's to law and equity, to party and to clan,
</l><l ln="55      ">And here's to equal suffrage in our government's careers.</l></stanza>
<stanza><l ln="56      ">God bless our common country, and preserve chief of state,
</l><l ln="57      ">And solace him who has the charge, with all Thy gracious love;
</l><l ln="58      ">Lest many should, perchance, forget this is the people's reign,
</l><l ln="59      ">We pray Thee, Lord, to keep it so the sceptre shall rotate,
</l><l ln="60      ">The common people e'er among in commonwealth and fane.</l></stanza></poem>

<caption>DEDICATION.</caption>
<hi r="smcap">It</hi> is, I believe, customary to dedicate one's work to a
patron. I suppose one's friend might with as much
grave bear the burden. When I remember the enthusiasm
with which my friend always espouses
my cause, and how tenaciously she clings to the few
virtues I have, and how blind she is to my innumerable
faults, I have no forbodings of evil when I approach her.
To her, Aurelia W. Beadle, the wife of my youth, this
poor memento of my faith is sincerely inscribed by
<signed r="smcap">The Author.</signed></dedicat>

<preface>
<caption>PREFACE.</caption>
<p><hi r="smcap">Some</hi> years ago I was wandering about the waste
places, thoroughfares and by&hyphen;ways of a beautiful
country
<l>&ldquo;Where the cypress and myrtle,</l>
<l>&indent;Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime;</l>
<l>Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle</l>
<l>&indent;Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime;&rdquo;</l>
and, as I was passing, I wrote a few simple sketches of
the things that impressed me.</p>
<p>This land is commonly known as the Sunny South
and is sometimes called &ldquo;Dixie;&rdquo; for this reason I call
them <hi r="italic">Sketches from Life in Dixie</hi>.</p>
<p>Night before last I bundled them together, and sat
down to admire the children of my fancy. No mother
ever hung over the cradle of her first born with such delight
as I did over them. For once these sketches had
an audience; the universe was my theatre and my imagination
filled it to the outer limits with eager listeners.
I sat reading to them, far into the wee sma' hours of the
night, till the absence of applause brought me to my
senses, and I stopped to hear the clock on the stroke of
two. About this time Benjamin Beaumont came into
my room, slapped me playfully on the shoulder, and said,
&ldquo;Sol, why don't you bring this thing to an end? Write
a preface and an advertisement for your book, publish it,
and put it on the market. There are some good things
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This disposed of my fancy; and brought me, for the
first time in my life, down to real thought, for if there
is anything that requires thought it is the preface of a
<pb n="VI">
book. You may tip the pinions of your fancy with fiction,
and let it flit aimlessly about the inner pages of
your book if you will; but when it comes to writing the
last page of it, and tacking it to the front, and calling it
a preface, I should like to see you escape the thoughts
of the critic. This thought murdered my fancy, and
my audience vanished&mdash;only three of us remained, the
Reviewer, the Critic, and I. For us a short preface will
do; in short, since I come to think of it, the writing of
the thing is a waste of energy; so I will put it off till another
time and content myself with telling the simple
truth, <hi r="italic">Sketches from Life in Dixie</hi> is but the work of a
novice. He wrote them for amusement; and publishes
them at the solicitation of his friend Benjamin Beaumont.
If they are accepted by that vaccillating thing
known as Public Opinion, he will be thankful: if they
are spurned by it, he will not complain, for the cranky
old thing is whimsical anyhow.</p>
<signed>With patience I await the end, and subscribe myself
Yours truly, <hi r="smcap">S. A. Beadle</hi>. Jackson, Miss.</signed></preface>

</l><l ln="64      ">With their witty convivial delight.
</l><l ln="65      ">But sweeter, sweeter far, than all of these,
</l><l ln="66      ">&indent;Are the delicious joys young lovers steal,
</l><l ln="67      ">While making love beneath the verdant trees,
</l><l ln="68      ">&indent;As they feel the full, wild, passionate weal

</l><l ln="81      ">Makes the heart beat quick and the spirit run,

</l><l ln="88      ">To embellish thy resting place for thee.
</l><l ln="89      ">For chastity's reclining couch should be
</l><l ln="90      ">&indent;A sacred shrine, where the gallant daily goes,
</l><l ln="91      ">&indent;A self&hyphen;made vassal, chief of love's heroes

<firstl><l ln="1        "><hi r="smcap">Ah</hi>, thou beautiful embellishment of earth,
</l></firstl>
<l ln="2        ">&indent;By dew, and rain, and dutiful spring hurled,
</l><l ln="3        ">&indent;A thing of loveliness, into this world
</l><l ln="4        ">Of woe, and discord, and the cruel dearth
</l><l ln="5        ">That blights our desires, and turns our hearth
</l><l ln="6        ">&indent;Into a charnel house; nor king, nor earl,
</l><l ln="7        ">Nor wit, can provoke the sad heart to mirth,
</l><l ln="8        ">&indent;Where our hopes all end and our colors furl.
</l><l ln="9        ">Fit emblem of man's transient stage art thou;
</l><l ln="10      ">&indent;This morn beheld thee delightfully fair,
</l><l ln="11      ">Full of fragrance, pleasingly sweet; but now,
</l><l ln="12      ">This eve, thy withered form sleeps on the prow
</l><l ln="13      ">&indent;Of that barque grim Death is launching out there,
</l><l ln="14      ">&indent;In the omnivorous sea of dispair.</l></poem>
