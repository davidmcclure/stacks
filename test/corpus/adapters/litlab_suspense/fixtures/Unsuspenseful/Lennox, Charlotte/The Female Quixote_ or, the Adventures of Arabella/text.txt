r"~ ries sears, was the first and most
l T ¬¢! distinguished Favourite at Court:
S .- He held the most honourable

Employments under the Crown,
disposed of all Places of Profit as he pleased,
presided at the Council, and in a manner
governed the whole Kingdom.

VOL. I, B .This

This extensive Authority could not fail of
making him many Enemies: He fell at las a
Sacrifice to the Plots they were continually
forming against him; and was not only removed
from all his Employments, but banished
the Court for ever.

The Pain his undefervecDifgrace gave him,
he was enabled to conceal by the natural
Haughtiness of his Temper; and, behaving
rather like a Man who had resigned, than been
dismissed from his Posts, he imagined he
triumphed sufficiently over the Malice of his
Enemies, while he seemed to be wholly insensible
of the Effets it produced. His secret
Discontent, however, was so much augmented
by the Opportunity he now had of observing
the Baseness and Ingratitude of Mankind,
which in some Degree he experienced every
Day, that. he resolved to quit all Society whatever,
and devote the rest of his Life to Solitude
and Privacy. For the Place of his Retreat he
pitched upon a Castle he had in a very remote
Province of the Kingdom, in the Neighbourhood
of a shall Village, and several Miles distant
from any Town. The vast Extent of Ground
which surrounded this noble Building, he had
caused to be laid out in a Manner peculiar to
his Tafle: The most laborious Endeavours of
Art had been used to make it appear like the
beautiful Product of wild, uncultivated Nature.
But if this Epitome of Arcadia could boast of
only artless and simple Beauties, the Inside of
the Castle was adorned with a Magnificence
suitable to the Dignity and immense Riches of
the Gwaier.

While Things were preparing at the Castle
for his Reception, the Marquis, though now
advanced in Years, cast his Eves on a young
Lady, greatly inferior to himself in Quality,
but whose Beauty and good Sense promised
him an agreeable Companion. After a very
short Courtship, he married her, and in a few
Weeks carried his new Bride into the Country,
f:omi whence he absolutely resolved never to
Return.

The Marquis, following the Plan of Life
he had laid down, divided his Time between
the Company of his Lady, his Library, which
was large and well furnished, and his (ardent.
Sometimes he took the Diversion of Hunting,
but never admitted any Company whatever;
and his Pride and extreme Reserve rendered
him so wholly inaccessible to the Country
Gentry about him, that none ever presumed
to solicit his Acquaintance.

In the Second Year of his Retirement, the
Marchioness brought him a Daughter, and
died in Three Days after her Delivery. The
Marquis, who had tenderly loved her, was
extremely afflicted at her Death; but Time
having produced its usual Efi'ets, his great
Fondness for the little arabella intirely engrossed
his Attention, and made up all the
Happiness of his Life. At Four Years of
Age he took her from under the Direction of
the Nurses and Women appointed to attend
her, and permitted her to receive no Part of her
Education from another, which he was capable
of giving her himself. He taught her to read
and write in a very few Montis; and, as she

B 2 grCav

grew older, finding in her an uncommon
Quickness of Apprehension, and an Understanding
capable of great Improvements, he
resolved to cultivate so promising a Genius
with the utmost Care; and, as he frequently,
in the Rapture of paternal Fondness, expressed
himself, render her Mind as beautiful as her
Person was lovely.

Nature had indeed given her a most charming
Face, a Shape easy and delicate, a sweet and
insinuating Voice, and an Air so full of Dignity
and Grace, as drew the Admiration of all
that saw her. These native Charms were improved
with all the Heightening of Art; her
Dress was perfectly magnificent; the best
Masters of Music and Dancing were lent for
from London to attend her. She soon became
a perse Mistress of the French and Italian
Languages, under the Care of her Father;
and it's not to be doubted, but she would
have made a great Proficiency in all useful
Knowlege, had not her whole Time been
taken up by another Study.

From her earliest Youth she had discovered
a Fondness for Reading, which extremely delighted
the Marquis; he permitted her therefore
the Use of his Library, in which, unfortunately
for her, were great Store of Romances,
and, what was fill more unfortunate,
not in the original French, but very bad
Translations.

The deceased Marchioness had purchased
there Books to soften a Solitude which she
found very disagreeable; and, after her Death,

the Marquis removed them from her Closet
into his Library, where Arabella found them.

The surprising Adventures with which
they were filled, proved a most pleasing Entertainment
to a young Lady, who was wholly
secluded from the World; who had no other
Diversion, but ranging like a Nymph through
Gardens, or, to lay better, the Woods and
Lawns in which she was inclosed; and who
had no other Conversation but that of a grave
and melancholy Father, or her own Attendants.


Her Ideas, from the Manner of her Life,
and the Objects around her, had taken a
romantic Turn; and, supposing Romances
were real Pictures of Life, from them she
drew all her Notions and Expectations. By
them she was taught to believe, that Love was
the ruling Principle of the World; that every
other Passion was subordinate to this; and
that it caused all the Happiness and Miseries of
Life. Her Glass, which she often consulted,
always shewed her a Form so extremely lovely,
that, not finding herself engaged in such Adventures
as were common to the Heroines in
the Romances she read, she often complained
of the Insensibility of Mankind, upon whom
her Charms seemed to have lb little Influence.

The perfect Retirement she lived in, as-forded
indeed no Opportunities of making the
Conquests the desired; but The could not
comprehend, how any Solitude could be obscure
enough to conceal a Beauty like hers
from Notice; and thought the Reputation of
her Charms sufficient to bring a Croud of

B 3 Adorers

Adorers to demand her of her Father. Her
Mind being wholly filled with the moss extravagant
Expectations, the was alarmed by every
trifling Incident; and kept in a continual Anxiety
hy a V similitude of Hopes, Fears, Withes,
and Disappointments.

C H A P. II.
Contains a Description of a Lady's Dress

in Albion slot much above Two thousand
Tears ago.- The Beginning of an Adventure
which seers to promis a great
deal. Arabella had now entered into her
-/ Seventeenth Year with the Regret of feeing
herself the Objiec of Admiration to a few
Rustics only, who happened to see her; when,
one Sunday, making use of the Permission the
Marquis sometimes allowed her, to attended
Service at the Church belonging to the
Village near which they lived, her Vanity was
flattered with an Adorer not altogether unworthy
of her Notice.

This Gentleman was young, gay, handsome,
and very elegantly dressed; he was just
come from London with an Intention to pass
ime Weeks with a Friend in that Part of the
Country; and at the time Arabella entered
the Church, his Eyes, which had wandered
from one rural Fair to another, were in an instant
fixed upon her Face. She blushed with
a very becoming Modesty; and, pleased with

the unusual Appearance of so fine gentleman,
and the particular Notice he took of her, palled
on to her Seat thro' a double Row of Country
People, who,with a Profusion ofaukward Bows
and Courtesies, expressed their Respect.

Mr. H'rI':y, for that was the Stranger's
Name, was no less surprised at her Beauty,
than the Singularity of her Dress ; and the odd
Whim of being followed into the Church by
three Women-Attendants, who, as soon as she
was seated, took their Places behind her.

Her Dress, tho' singular, was far from being
unbecoming. All the Beauties of her Neck
and Shape were let off to the greatest Advantage
by the Falhion of her Gown, which, in the
Manner of a Robe, was made to fit tight to
her Body; and fastened on the Breast with a
Knot of Diamonds. Her fine black Hair, hung
upon her Neck in Curs, which had so much
the Appearance of being artless, that all but
her Maid, whose Employment it was to give
them that Form, imagined they were so. Her
Head-dress was only a few Knots advantageously
disposed, over which she wore a white
Sarsenet Hood, somewhat in the Form of a
Veil, with which she sometimes wholly covered
her fair Face, when fie saw herself beheld
with too much Attention.

This Veil had never appeared to her so necessary
before. Mr. Hervey's eager Glances
threw her into so much Confusion, that, pulling
it over her Face as much as she was able, she
remained invisible to him all the time they afterwards
flayed in the Church. This Action,
by which she would have had him understand

B 4 that

that she was displeased at his gazing on her
with so little Repeat, only increased his Curiosity
to know who she was.

When the Congregation was dismissed, he
hastened to the Door, with an Intention to offer
her his Hand to help her tother Coach; but
seeing the magnificent Equipage that waited
for her, and the Number of Servants that attended
it, he conceived a much higher Idea of
her Quality than he had at first; and, changing
his Design, contented himself with only bowing
to her as (he passed; and as soon as her Coach
drove away, inquired of some Persons nearest
him, who She was ?

These Rustics, highly delighted with the
Opportunity of talking to the gay Londoner,
whom they looked upon as a very extraordinary
Ierlbon gave him all the Intelligence they were
able, concerning the Lady he inquired after;
and tilled him with an inconceivable Surprize at
the strange Humour of the Marquis, who buried
so beautiful a Creature in Obscurity.

At his Return home he expressed his Admiration
of her inTermsthatperluaded hisFriend,
she had made some Impression on his Heart;
and, after rallying him a little upon this Suspicion,
he affirmed a more serious Air, and told
him, If he really liked Lady'Bella;,.he thought
it not impossible but he might obtain her. The
poor Girl, added he, has been kept in Confinement
so long, that I believe it would not be difficult
to persuade her to free herself Marriage.
She never had a Lover in her Life; and therefore
the first Person who addresses her has the
fairest Chance for succeeding.

Mr. Hervey, tho' he could notperfuade himself
his Cousin was in Earnest when he advised
him to court the only Daughter of a Man of
the Marquis's Quality, and Heiress to his vast
Estates; yet relished the Scheme, and resolved
to make some Attempt upon her before he left
the Country. However, he concealed his Design
from his Cousin, not being willing to expose
himself to be ridiculed, if he did not succeed;
and, turning the Advice he had given
him into a Jest, left him in the Opinion, that
he thought no more of it.

CH A P. III.
In which the Adventure goes on after the

4jRABELLA, in the mean time, was

wholly taken up with the Adventure, as
flie called it, at Church: The Person and
Dress of the Gentleman who had so particularly
gazed on her there, was so different from
what she had been accustomed to see, that she
immediately concluded, he was of some distinguished
Rank. It was pail a Doubt, she
thought, that he was excessively in Love with
her; and as she soon expected to have some
very extraordinary Proofs of his Passion, her
Thoughts were wholly employed on the Manner
in which she should receive them.

As soon as she came home, and had paid
her Duty to the Marquis, she hurried to her
Chamber, to beat Liberty to indulge her agreed

5 ale

able Reflections; and, after the Example of
her Heroines, when any thing extraordinary
happened to them, called her favourite Woman;
or, to ife her own Language, her,
in whom (he confided her most secret

Well, Lucy, said the, did you observe that
Stranger who ey'd us * so heedfully To-day at
Church?

This Girl, notwithstanding her Country-simplicity,
knew a Compliment was expected
from her on this Occasion; and therefore replied,
" That (he did not wonder at the Gentleman's
flaring at her; for (he was sure he
had never seen any body so handsome as her
"Ladyship before."

I have not all the Beauty you attribute to me,
raid Arabella, smiling a little: And, with a very
moderate Share of it, I might well fix the Attention
of a Person who seemed to be not overmuch
pleased with the Objects about him:
However, pursued she, assuming a more serious
Air, if this Stranger he weak enough to entertain
any Sentiments more than indifferent
for me; I charge you, upon Pain of my Displeasure,
do not be accessary to the Conveying
his presumptuous Thoughts to me either by
Letters or Messages; nor sussex him to corrupt
your Fidelity with the Presents he wi very
probably offer you.

Lucy, to whom this Speech first gave a Hint
of what (he ought to expect from her Lady's
Lovers, finding herself of more Importance

The Heroines awaays (peak of themselves in ths Plural
Number.

than the imagined, was so pleated at the
Profpea which opened to her, that it was with
some Hesitation Ihe promised to obey her Orders.


Arabella, however, was satisfied with her assurances
of observing her Directions; and dismissed
her from her Presence, not without an
Apprehension of being too well obeyed.

A whole Week being elapsed without meeting
with the Importunities she expected, the
could hardly conceal her Surprize at so mortifying
a Disappointment; and frequently interrogated
Lucy, concerning any Attempts the
Stranger had made on her Fidelity; but the
Answers she received, only increased her Discontent,
as they convinced her, her Charms
had not had the Effect she imagined.

Mr. Hervey, however, had been all this
time employed in thinking of some Means to
get acquainted with the Marquis; for, being
possessed with an extraordinary Opinion of his
Wit, and personal Accomplishments, he did
not fear making some Impression on the Heart
of the young Lady; provided he could have aa
Opportunity of converting with her.

His Cousin's Advice was continually in his
Mind, and flattered his Vanity with the most
agreeable Hopes: But the Marquis's Fondness
for Solitude, and that Haughtiness which was
natural to him, rendered him so difficult of Access,
that Hervey, from the Intelligence he received
of his Humour, despaired of being able
to prosecute his Scheme; when, meeting with
a young Farmer in one of his Evening-Walks,
sad entering into Conversation with him upon

B 6 t:vcral

several Country Subject, the Discourse at last
turned upon the Marquis of - whose fine
House and Gardens were within their View;
upon which the young Fellow informed him,
he was Brother to a young Woman that attended
the Lady Arabella; and, being fond of
lengthening out the Conversation with so fine a
Gentleman, gave him, without being desired,
the domestic History of the whole Family, ashe
had received it from Lucy, who was the
Sister he mentioned.

Hervey, excessively delighted at this accidental
Meeting with a Person so capable of
serving his Design, asserted a great Desire of
being better acquainted with him; and, under
Pretence of acquiring some Knowlege in rural
Affairs, accustomed himself to call so often at
Ill/iamn's Farm, that at last he met with the
Person whom the Hopes of seeing had so often
carried him thither.

Lucy,the Moment she saw him enter, knowing
him again, blushed at the Remembrance
of the Discourse which had passed between her
Lady and herself concerning him; and was not
at all surprised at the Endeavours he used to
speak to her apart: But, as soon as he began a
Conversation concerning Arabella, she interrupted
him by saying, I know, Sir, that you
are dij2rae7edly in Love with my Lady; but The
has forbid me to receive any Letters presages
from you; and therefore I beg you will not
offer to bribe me; for I dare not disobey her.

Mr. Hervey was at first so astonished at her
Speech, that he knew not what to think of it;
but, after a little Reflection, attributing to an

Excess of aukward Cunning what, in Reality,
was an:Effea of her Simplicity, he resolved to
make use 6ofthe Hint she had given him; and,
presenting her with a Couple of Guineas, intreated
her to venture displeasing her Lady, by
bearing a Letter from him; promising to reward
her better, if she succeeded.

Lucy made some Difficulty to comply; but,
not being able absolutely to refute the first Bribe
that ever was offered to her, she, after some
Intreaties, consented to take the Letter; and,
receiving the Money he presented her, left him
at Liberty to write, after the had got her Brother
to furnish him with Materials for that Purpose.


CH A P. IV.
A Mistake, which produces no great Consequences

- An extraordinary Comment
upon a Behaviour natural enough An
Instance of a Lady's Compafion for her
Lover, which the Reader may possibly
think not very compassionate.
H Grey, who was Master of no great

Elegance in Letter-writing, was at firs
at some Lots, how to address a Lady of her
Quality, to whom he was an absolute Stranger,
upon the Subject of Love; but, conceiving
there was no great Occasion for much Ceremony
in declaring himself one who had been
educated in the Country, and who, he believed,
could not be displeased with a Lover of his

Figure, he therefore, in plain Terms, told
her, how deeply he was enamoured of her; and
conjured her to afford him some Opportunity
of paying his Respects to her.

Lucy received this Letter from him with a
worse Grace than The did the Gold; and, tho'
the promised him to deliver into her Lady immediately,
yet she kept it a Day or two before
The had the Courage to attempt it: At last,
drawing it out of her Pocket, with a bashful
Air, she presented it to her Lady, telling her it
came from the fine Gentleman whom she saw
at Church.

Arabella blushed at the Sight of the Letter;
and tho', in Reality, she was not displeased,
yet, being a sprat Observer of romantic Forms,
she chid her Woman severely for taking it.
Carry it back, added the, to the presumptuous
Writer of it; and let him know how greatly
his Insolence has offended me.

Lucy, however, suffered the Letter to remain
on the Toilet, expecting some Change
in her Lady's Mind; for she traversed the
Chamber in great seeming Irresolution, often
sealing a Glance to the Letter, which she had
a wrong Inclination to open; but, searching
the Records of her Memory for a Precedent,
and not finding, that any Lady ever opened a
Letter from an unknown Lover, she reiterated
her Commands to Lucy to carry it back, with
a Look and Accent so very severe, that the Girl,
extremely apprehensive of having offended her,
put the Letter again in her Pocket, resolving
to return it the first Opportunity.

Mr. Hervey, who had his Thoughts wholly
taken up with the flattering Profpea of Success,
no sooner saw Lucy, who gave him his
Letter without speaking a Word, than, supposing
it had been the Answer he expected, he
eagerly snatched it out of her Hand, and,
kissing it first in a Rapture of Joy, broke it
open; but his Surprize and Confusion, when
he saw it was his own Letter returned, was
inexpressible. For some Moments he kept
his Eyes fastened upon the tender Billet, as if
he was really reading it. His Disappointment,
and the ridiculous Figure he knew he must
make in the Eyes of his Messenger, filled him
with so much Confusion, that he did not dare
to look up; but, recovering himself at last,
he asserted to turn it into a Jeff; and, laughing
first himself, gave Lucy the Liberty of
laughing also, who had with much Difficulty
been able to prevent doing it before.

The Curiosity he felt to hear how she had
acquitted herself of the Trust he had reposed
in her, made him oblige her to give a Truce
to her Mirth, in order to satisfy him; and
Lucy, who was extremely exact in her Relations,
told him all that had passed, without
omitting the smallest Circumstance.

Though it was impossible to draw any
favourable Omen from what he heard, yet he
determined to make another Effort, before he
set out for London; and, taking Leave of his
Confident, after he had appointed her to meet
him again the next Day, at her Brother's, he
went home to consider upon Means to effect

his Designs, which the ill Success of his first
Attempt had not forced him to abandon.

Arabella, who expected to hear, that the
Return of his Letter would make her Lover
commit some very extravagant Actions;, and
having impatiently waited for an Account of
them from Lucy; finding the seemed to
have no Intention to begin a Discourse: concerning
him; asked her, at last, If she had
executed her Commission, and returned the
Letter to the insolent Unknown?

The Girl answered, Yes.
Which not being all that her Lady expected,
And how did he receive it? resumed The,
peevishly.

Why Madam, replied Lucy, I believe he
thought your Ladyship had sent him an answer;
for he kissed the Letter several times.

Foolish Wench! replied Arabella, How can
you imagine he had the Temerity to think I
should answer his Letter? A Favour, which,
though he had spent Years in my Service,
would have been infinitely greater than he
could have expected. No, Lucy, he kissed
the letter, either because thought it had been
touched at leaPt by my Hands, or to shew the
perfect Submission with which he received my
Commands; and it is not to be doubted, but
his Despair will force him to commit some
desperate Outrage against himself, which I do
not hate him enough to wish, though he has
mortally offended me.

Arabella was possessed of great Sensibility
and Softness; and, being really persuaded, that
her Lover would entertain some fatal Design,

seemed so much affected with the Thoughts of
what might happen, that Lucy, who tenderly
loved her, begged her not to be fb much concerned
for the Gentleman: There is no Fear,
added she, that he will do himself a Mischief;
for when he discovered his Mistake, he laughed
heartily, as well as myself.

How! replied Arbela, extremely surprised,
Did he laugh?

Which Lucy confirming, Doubtless, resumed
she, having taken a little Time to confider
of so strange a Phenomenon, he laughed,
because his Reason was disturbed at the sudden
Shock he received: Unhappy Man ! his Presumption
will be severely enough punished,
though I do not add Anger to the Scorn which
I have expressed for him: Therefore, Lucy,
you may tell him, if you please, that, notwithstanding
the Offence he has been guilty
of, I am not cruel enough to wish his Death;
and that I command him to live, if he can
live without Hope.

In which one would imagine the Adventure

concluded, but for a Promise,
that something else is to come.
T UCnow began to think there was something

more, than she imagined, in this
Affair. Mr. Hervey indeed, in her Opinion,
had seemed to be very far from having any
Design to attempt his own Life; but her

Lady, she thought, could not possibly be mistaken;
and therefore the resolved to carry her
MIefiaec to him immediately, though it was
then late in the Evening.

Accordingly the went to her Brother's,
where flie had some Hope of meeting with
him; but not finding hint there, fhc obliged
him to go to the House where he lived, and tell
him she desired to speak with him.

william, being let into the Secret of his
Sifter's frequent Meetings with Mr. Hervey,
imagined she had some agreeable News to acquaint
him with; and therefore ran immediately
to his Relation's House, which was but
at a Iinall Distance; but he was told Mr.
Hervey was in Bed, very much indisposed, and
could not be seen.

This News put Lucy in a terrible Fright:
She told her Apprehensions to her Brother;
which being such as her Lady had put into her
Head, and were now confirmed by Mr. Hervey's
Illness, the young Farmer flood amazed,
not being able to comprehend her Meaning;
and The, without slaying to explain herself any
further, went home to the Castle, and told
her Lady, That what she feared was come to
pass; the Gentleman would certainly die; for
he was very ill in Bed.

This being no more than what Arabella expected,
she discovered no Surprize; but only
asked Luy, If she had delivered her Message
to him ?

Would you have me, Madam, replied The,
go to his House? I am afraid the Marquis
will hear of it.

Mv Father, replied Arabella, can never be
offended with me for doing a charitable
Action.

Ah ! Madam, interrupted Lucy, let me go
j then immediately, for fear the poor Gentle
man should grow worse.

If he be sick almost to Death, resumed Aram
tela, he will recover, if I command him to do
so: When did you hear of a Lover dying
through Despair, when his Mifhefs let him
know it was her Pleasure he should live ? But
as it will not be altogether so proper for you to
go to his House, as it may be suspected you
come from me I'll write a few Lines, which
you shall copy, and your Brother may carry
them to him To-morrow, and I'll engage he
shall be well in a few Hours.

Saying this, file went into her Closet, and,
having written a short Note, made Lucy write
it over again. it was as follows:
Lucy, To the Unfortunate Lover of her Lady.
i Y Lady, who is the most generous Person

in the World, has commanded me
to tell you, that, presumptuous as you are, she
does not desire your Death; nay more, she
commands you to live, and permits you, in
case you obey her, to hope for her Pardon,
provided you keep within the Bounds she prescribes
to you.

This Letter Lucy copied, and Arabella, examining
it again, thought it rather too kind;

and, feemingdefirous ofmakingfome Alteration
in it, Lucy, who was extremely anxious for Mr.
Hervey's Life, fearing lest she should alter it
in rich a manner, that the Gentleman might
be at Liberty to die, if he chore it, conjured
her Lady in such pressing Terms to let it remain
as it was, that Arabella suffered herself
to be prevailed upon by her Intreaties; and,
remembring that it was not uncommon for
the Ladies in Romances to relax a little in
their Severity through the Remonstrances of
their Women, told her, with an inchanting
Smile, that the would grant her Desire; and
went to Bed with that pleasing Satisfaction,
which every generous Mind experiences at
the Consciousness of having done some very
benevolent Action.

In the Morning, this life-restoring Billet
was dispatched by Lucy to her Brother, inclosed
in one to him, charging him to carry it
to the tick Gentleman immediately.

IFili/am, having a strong Curiosity to see
what his Siiterhad written, ventured to open it;
-and, not being able to imagine Lady Bella had
really given her Orders to write what appeared
to him the most unintelligible Stuff in the
World, resolved to suppress this Letter till he
had questioned her a little concerning it.

A few Hours after, Mr. Hervey, who expected
to meet Lucy at her Brother's, came in.
His Illness having been only a violent Headach,
to which he was subject, being now quite
off, he remembred the Appointment he had
made; but, having waited some time, and
file not coming, he returned again to his

Cousin's, leaving word for her, that he would
see her the next Day.

Scarce was he gone out, when Lucy, who
longed to know what Effect her Letter had
produced in his Health, came in; and eagerly
inquiring of her Brother how Mr. Hervey was,
received for Answer, that he had been there
a Moment before she came.

Well, cried she, clasping her Hands together,
with Surprize, my Lady said, her Letter
would cure him, if he was ever so sick; but I
did not imagine he would have been well
enough to come abroad so soon.

Your Lady! interrupted William, why was
it not yourself that wrote that Letter you gave
to me?

No, truly, Brother, resumed she: How
was it possible I should write so fine a Letter ?
My Lady made every Word of it, and I only
wrote it after her.

william, hearing this, would not own the
Indiscretion he now thought he had been
guilty of, in keeping the Letter; but suffered his
Sister to return to her Lady, in the Belief that
he had delivered it, resolving, when he saw
her next, to say he had lost it; for he knew
not what Excuse to make to Mr. Hervey for
not giving it him when he saw him.

Arabella received the Account of her Lover's
Recovery as a Thing she was absolutely sure
of before ; and thinking The had now done all
that could be expected from her Compassion,
resumed her usual Severity, and commanded
Lucy to mention him no more.' If he loves
me with that Purity he ought to do, pursued

she, he will cease to importune me any further:
And though his Passion be ever so violent, his
Respect and Submission to my Commands will
oblige him to Silence. The Obedience he
has already shewn, in recovering at the first
Intimation I gave, that it was my Will he
should do so, convinces me, I need not apprehend
he will renew his Follies to displease
me.

Lucy, who found by this Discourse of her
Lady's, that her Commission was at an End
with regard to Mr. Hervey, followed her Di-regions
so exactly, that hie not only spoke no
more of him to her, but also, in order to avoid
him, neglected to go to her Brother's.

His Impatience at not seeing her made him
prevail upon her Brother to go the Cate, 'and
intreat her to give him another Interview: But
Lucy positively refused; and, to make a Merit
with her Lady of her Obedience, informed
her what he had requested.

Arabella, resenting a Boldness which argued
so little Refpet to her Commands, began
now to repent of the Compassion she had
shewn him; and, commending Lucy for what
file had done, bid her tell the insolent Unknown,
if he ever sent to her again, that she
was resolved never to pardon the Contempt
he had shewn for her Orders.

Mr. Hervey, finding himself deserted by
Lucy, resolved to give over his Attempts, congratulating
himself for his Discretion in not
acquainting his Cousin with what he had already
done: His Heart not being very much
engaged, he found no great Difficulty in consoling

himfelffor his bad Success. In a few
Days he thought of Lady Bella no more, than
if he had never seen her; but an Accident
bringing her again in his Way, he could not
resist the Inclination he felt to speak to her;
and by that means drew upon himself a very
sensible Mortification.

CHA P. VI.
1n which the Adventure is really concluded;
tbo', possibly, not as the Reader expected.
T HE Marquis sometimes permitting his
Daughter to ride out, and this being
the only Diversion the was allowed, or ever experienced,
she did not fail to take it as often as
she could.

She was returning from one of there Airings
one Day, attended by two Servants, when
Mir. Hervey, who happened to be at some distance,
observing a Lady on Horseback, who
made a very graceful Figure, he rode up to
her, in order to have a nearer View; and,
knowing Lady Bella again, resolved to speak
to her: But while he was considering how he
Should accost her, Arabella suddenly seeing him,
and offering he was making up to her, her
Imagination immediately suggested to her, that
this insolent Lover had a Design to filiae her
Person; and this Thought terrifying her extremely,
she gave a loud Shriek; which Mr.
Hervey hearing, rode eagerly up to her to inquire

the Reason of it, at the same time that
her two Attendants, as much amazed as himself,
came galloping up also.

Arabella, upon his coming close to her, redoubled
her Cries. If you have any Valour,
said she to her Servants, defend your unfortunate
Mistress, and rescue her from this unworthy
Man.

The Servants, believing him to be a Highwayman,
by this Exclamation, and dreading
lest he should present his Pistol at their Heads,
if they offered to make any Resistance, recoiled
a few Paces back, expecting he would demand
their Purses when he had robbed their Lady:
But the extreme Surprize he was in, keeping
him motionless, the Fellows not seeing ahy
Pistols his Hand, and animated by Arabella's
Cries, who,' calling them Cowards and Traitors,.
urged them to deliver her; they both, ina
Moment, laid hold of Mr. Hervey, and forced
him to alight; which they did also themselves,
fill keeping fast hold of him, whom Surprize,
Shame, and Rage, had hitherto kept silent.

Rascals! cried he, when he was able to
speak, what do you mean by using me in this
manner ? Do you suppose I had any Intention
to hurt the Lady ?- What do you take me
for?

For a Villain, for a Ravisher, interrupted
Arabella, who, contrary to all Laws both human
and divine, endeavour to possess yourself
by Force of a Person whom you are not worthy
to serve; and whose Charity and Compassion
you have returned with the utmost Ingratitude.

Upon rnv Word, Madam, 1;.!.1 \Mr. nir:'-.'-,
I don't un!dcllt.tlnd one word you ,say: You
either nlititke me for lone otlhr 'elrloni, or are
plcalel to divert vourlilf with the Surprises I aIm
in: But I bel-cell you carry the Jet no farther,
and order your Servants to let me go i or, by
Heaven - crl hed
he shrugging to get loose, if I
can hut free one of my Hands, I'll stab the
Scoundrels before your Face.

It is not with Threats like slices, resumed
Arabella with great Calmness, that I can be
moved. A little more Submission and Respect
would become you better; you are now wholly
in my Power; I may, if I please, carry you to
my Father, and have you severely punished for
your Attempt: But to shew you, that I am as
generous as you are base and designing, I'll give
you Freedom, provided you promise me never
to appear before me again: But, in order to secure
my own Safety, you must deliver up your
Arms to my Servants, that I may be assured you
will not have it in your Power to make a second
Attempt upon my Liberty.

Mr. Hervey, whose Astonishment was increased
by every Word she spoke, began now to
be apprehensive, that this might prove a very
serious Affair, since the denied resolved to believe
he had a Design to carry her off; and,
knowing that an Attempt of that Nature upon
an Heiress might have dangerous Consequences,
he resolved to accept the Conditions flie ushered
him: But while he delivered his Hanger to the
Servant, he allured her in the fliongett 'terms,
that he had no other Design in riding up to her,
but to hive a nearer View of her Pelion

VOL, . C Add

Add not Falsehood, slid lrabc/la sternly, to a
Crime already black enough; for tho', by an
Efieit of my (en profit, I have resolved not to
deliver you up to the Resentment of my Father,
yet nothing shall ever be able to make me pardon
this Outrage. Go then, pursuits the, go,
baiE Man, unworthy of the Care I took of thy
Safety; go to some distant Country, where I
may never hearts thee more; and stiffer me, if
possible, to lose the Remembrance of thy
Crimes,

Saying this, file ordered her Servants, who
had got the Hanger in their Possession, to set
him at Liberty, and mount their Horses; which
they did immediately, and followed their Lady,
who rode with all imaginable Speed to the
Castle.

Mr. Hervey, not yet recovered from his Surprize,
flood some .Moments considering the
strange Scene he had been Witness to i and in
which he had, much against his Will, appeared
the principal Character. As he was not acquainted
with Lady Bella's Foible, he concluded
her Fears of him were occasioned by her Simplicity,
and some Misrepresentations that had
been made her by Lucy, who, he thought, had
betrayed him; and, fearing this ridiculous
Adventure would be soon made public, and himself
exposed to the Sneers of his Country Acquaintance,
he resolved to go back to London as
soon as possible.

The next Day, pretending he had received a
Letter which obliged him to set out immediately,
he took Leave of his Cousin, heartily
glad at the Escape he should make from his Railer;

for he did not doubt but the Story would

1vcr thon be known, and told greatly to his Disadvantage.


But ,Arabella, in order to be completely generous,
a Quality for which all the Heroines
are famous, laid a Command upon her two Attendants
not to mention what had passed, giving
them, at the same time, Money to secure
their Secrecy; and threatening them with her
Displeasure, if they disobeyed.

Aiibllan, as soon as she had an Opportunity,
did not fail to acquaint her faithful Lucy with
the Danger from which she had so happily
escaped, thanking Heaven at the same time
with great Devotion, for having preserved her
from the Hands of the Ravisher.

Two or three Months rolled away, after this
Accident, without offering any new Adventure
to our fair Visionary; when her Imagination,
always prepossessed with the same fantastic Ideas,
made her humble upon another Mistake, equally
absurd and ridiculous.

C H A P. VII.
In-which some Contradictions are very bap;

HE Marquis's head Gardener had received
a young Fellow into his Master's Service,
who had lived in several Families of Distension.
He had a good Face; was tolerably gentle';
and, having an Understanding something-.bov;l
his Condition, join'd to a great deal ofjcr.-io:'-

C2 ham d

/ndrlPoliteneTs, which he had contrived while
he lived at London, he appeared a very extraordinary
Pcribn among the Rustics who were his
Fellow-servants.

Arabella, when the walked in the Garden,
had frequent Opportunities of seeing this young
Man, whom she observed with a very particular
Attention. His Person and Air had something,
She thought, very distinguishing. When she
condescended to speak to him about any Business
he was employed in, she took Notice, that
his Answers were shamed in a Language vastly
superior to his Condition ; and the Respect he
paid her had quite another Air from that of
the aukward Civility of the other Servants.

Having discerned to many Marks of a Birth
far from being mean, she easily passed from an
Opinion that he was a Gentleman, to a Belief
that he was something more; and every new
Sight of him adding Strength to her Suspicions,
she remained, in a little time, perfectly convinced
that he was some Person of Quality, who,
disguised in the Habit of a Gardener, had introduced
himself into her Father's Service, in order
to have an Opportunity of declaring a Pats
sion to her, which must certainly be very great,
since it had forced him to assume disappearance
so unworthy of his noble Extraction.

Wholly possessed with this Thought, the let
herself to observe him more narrowly; and soon
found out, that he went very aukwardly about
his Work; that he sought Opportunities of being
alone; that he threw himself in her Way
as often as he could, and gazed on her very attentively
: She sometimes fansied she saw him

endeavour to Smother a Sigh when le answered
her any Question about his Work; once saw
him leaning against a Tree with his Hands
crossed upon his Breads; and, having lost a
String of shall Pearls, which Ihe remembered
he had seen her threading as file sat in one of the
Arbours, was persuaded he had taken it up,
and kept it for the Objet of his fi.clct Adoration.


She often wondered, indeed, that she did not
find her Name carved on the Trees, with some
mysterious Expressions of Love; that he whenever
discovered lying along the Side of one of
the little rivulets, increasing the Stream with his
Tears; nor, for three Month !hilt he had lived
there, had ever been sick of :. Fever caused by
his Grief, and theConftraint he put upon himself
in not declaring his Passion: But she considered
again, that his Fear of being discovered kept
him from amusing himself with making the
Trees bear the Records of his secret Thoughts,
or of indulging his Melancholy in any Manner
expressive of the Condition of his Soul; and, as
for his not being sick, his Youth, and the
Strength of his Constitution, might, even for a
longer time, bear him up against the Assaults of
a Fever: But he appeared much thinner and
paler than he used to be; and (he concluded,
therefore, that he. mute in time fink under the
Violence of his Passion, or eIe he forced to declare
it to her; which she considered as a very
great Misfortune; for, not finding in herself
indisposition to approve his Love, the must necessarily
banish him from her Presence, for fear
he should have the Presumption to hope, that

C 3 Time

'time might do any thing in his Favour: And
it was possible also, that the Sentence she would
be obliged to pronounce, might either cause his
Death, or force him to commit same extravagant
AtLion, which would discover him to her
leather, who would, perhaps, think her guilty
of losing a secret Correspondence with lin.

'I'hefe Thoughts perplexed her bo mutch, that,
hoping to find home Relief by unburdening her
Mind to Lucy, the told her all her Uneasiness
Ah ! said she to her, looking upon Edward,
who had just passed them, how unfortunate do
I think myself in being the Cause of that Pavilion
which makes this illustrious Unknown wear
away his Days in so shameful an Obscurity !
Yes, Lucy, pursued she, that Edward, whom
you regard as one of my Father's menial Servants,
is a Person sublime Quality, who submits
to this Disguise only to have an Opportunity
of seeing me every Day. But why do you
seem so surprised ? Is it possible, that you have
not suspected him to be what he is ? Has he never
unwittingly made any Discovery of himself?
Have you not surprised him in Discourse with
his faithful 'Squire, who, certainly, lurks hereabouts
to receive his Commands, and is haply-the
Confident of his Passion ? Has he never entertained
you with any Conversation about me?
Or have you never seen any valuable Jewels
in his Position by which you llhfpeded him to
be not what he appears?

Truly, Madam, replied Lucy, I never took
him for any body life but a simple Gardener;
but now you open my Eyes, methinks I can
find I have been firainc!y milllkcni ; for lie does

not look like a Man of low Degree; and he
talks quite in another Manner from our Servants.
I never heard him indeed speak of vuolr
Ladyship, but once; and that was, when he
first sav you walking in the Garden, he asked
our coin, If you was not the Marquis's Daughter
? And he said, You was as beautiful as an
Angel. As for fine Jewels, I never saw any);
and I believe he has none ; bus he has a Watch,
and that looks as if he was fonlethin%, Madam:
Nor do I remember to have seen him talk with
any Stranger that looked like a 'Squire.

Lucy, having thus, with her usual Punctuality,
answered every Question her Lady put to her,
proceeded to ask her, What she should say, if
he should beg her to give her a Letter, as the
other Gentleman had done?
You must by no means take it, replied Arabella:
My Compassion had before like to have
been fatal to me. If he discovers his Quality tome,
Shall know in what manner to treat him.

They were in this Part of their Discourse,
when a Noise they heard at some Distance,
made Arabella bend her Steps to the Place from
whence it proceeded; and, to her infinite Amazement,
saw the head Gardener,. with a Stick he
had in his Hand, give several Blows to the concealed
Hero, who suffered the Indignity with
admirable Patience.

Shocked at seeing a Person of Quality treated
so unworthily, she called out to the Gardener
to hold his Hand; who immediately obeyed;
and Edward, seeing. the young Lady advance,
sneaked off, with an Air very different from an
Ordinates.

For what Crime, pray, said Arabella, with
a itcrm Aspect, did you treat the Person I iiWr
with you so cruelly ? Ile whom you take filch
u!ibecominil Liberties with, nay possibly-But
;again I ask you, What has he done ? You
should make ime Allowance fur his want of
Skill in the abject Employment he is in at
present.

It is not for his want of Skill, Madam, said the
Gardener, that I corrected him; he knows his
Business very well, if he would mind it; but,
lIadam, I have discovered him-discovered

him, do you say? interrupted
Arabella: And has the Knowlege of his Condition
not been able to prevent such Usage ? or
rather, Has it been the Occasion of his receiving
it ?

His Conditions are very bad, Madam, returned
the Gardener; and I am afraid are such
as will one Day prove the Ruin of Body and
Soul too. I have for rome time suspected he
had bad Designs in his Head; and just now
watched him to the Fill-pond, and prevented
him from

dear ! interrupted Lucy, looking pitifully
on her Lady, whose fair Bosom heaved with
Compassion, I warrant lie was going to make
away with himself.

No, resumed the Gardener, sailing at the
Mistake, he was only going to make away with
tome of the Carp, which the Rogue had
caught, and intended, I suppose, tO i'll; bat
I threw them into the Water atainl; and if
your Ladyship had not forbid me, I would have
drubbed him fondly for his Pains.

Fye ! fye ! interrupted Arabella, out of Breath
with Shame and Vexation, tell me no more of
there idle Tales.

Then, hastily walking on to hide the Blushes
which this strange Accusation of her illustrious
Lover had raised in her Face, she continued for
some time in the greatest Perplexity imaginable.


Lucy, who followed her, and could not
possibly reconcile what her Lady had been telling
her concerning Edward, with the Circumstance
of his Stealing the Carp, ardently wished to hear
her Opinion of this Matter; but, seeing her
deeply engaged with her own Thoughts, should
not venture to disturb her.

Arabella indeed, had been in such a terrible
Consternation, that it was some Time before
the even reconciled Appearances to herself; but,
as she had a most happy Faculty in accommodating
every Incident to her own Wishes and
Conceptions, !he examined this Matter so many
different Ways, drew so many Conclusions, and'
fansied so many Mysteries in the most indifferent
Ations of the supposed noble Unknown,
that she remained, at last, more than ever
confirmed in the Opinion, that he was some
great Personage, whom her Beauty had forced
to assume an Appearance unworthy of himself:
When Lucy, no longer able to keep Silence,
drew off sher Attention from those pleasing
Images, by speaking of the Carp-stealing Affair
again.

Arabella, whose Confusion returned at that
disagreeable Sound, charged her, in an angry
Tone, never to mention so injurious a Sufpi-

C 5 cion

cion any more: For, in fine, said she to her,
do you imagine a Person of his Rank could be
guilty of stealing Carp? Alas! pursued she,
sighing, he had, indeed, some fatal Design;
and, doubtless, would have executed it, had not
this Fellow so luckily prevented him.

But Mr. Inoodhind, Madam, raid Lucy, saw
the Carp in his Hand: I wonder what he was
going to do with them.

Still, refunded Ararl!a, extremely chagrined,
still will you wound my Ears with that horrid
Found? I tell you, obstinate and foolish Wench,
that this unhappy Man went thither to die; and
if he really caught the Fish, it was to conceal
his Design from Woodbine: Hs great Mind
could not suggest to him, that it was possible he
might be suffered of a Baseness like that this
ignorant Fellow accused him of; therefore he
took no Care about it, being wholly polished
by his despairing Thoughts.

However, Madam, laid Lucy, your, Ladyship
may prevent his going to theFifhpond again,
by laying your Commands upon him to live.

I shall do all that I ought, answered arabella; -
but my Care for the Safety of other Persons must
not make me forget what I owe to my own.

As she had always imputed Mr. Hervey's fansied
Attempt to carry her away, to the Letter
she had written to him, upon which he had probably
founded his Hopes of being pardoned for
it, she resolved to be more cautious for the future
in giving such Instances of her Compafion;
and was at a great Loss in what manner to comfort
her despairing Lover, without railing Expectations
the had no Inclination to confirm:

But she was delivered from her Perplexity by
the News of his having left the Marquis's Service;
which file attributed to some new Design
he had formed to obtain her; and Lucy, who
always thought as her Lady did, was of the
time Opinion; tho' it was talked among the
Servants, that Edward feared a Discovery of
more Tricks, and resolved not to slay till he
was disgracefully dismissed.

C H A P. VIII.
In which a Mistake, in point of Ceremony;

Arabella had scarce done thinking of
A this last Adventure, when the Marquis
communicated a Piece of Intelligence to her,
which opened a Prospect of an infinite Number
of new ones.

His Nephew, having just returned from his
Travels, was preparing to come and pay him a
Visit in his Retreat; and, as he always deigned
to marry Arabella to this Youth, of who.n he
was extremely fond, he told his Daughter of
the intended Visit of her Cousin, whom she had
not seen since she was eight Years old ; and,
f;r the first time, insinuated his Design Ass giving
him to her for an Husband.

Arabella, willie Delicacy w.: extremely
flocked at tl:; abrupt Declarant: ;- s* a-
ther, could hardly hide her C, .ii.; ir,

tho' the always intended to marry some time or
other, as all the Heroines had done, yet she
thought such an Event ought to be brought about
with an infinite deal of Trouble; and that it
was necessary she should pass to this State thro'
a great Number of Cares, Disappointments, and
Difireflcs of various Kinds, like them; that her
Lover should purchase her with his Sword from
a Croud of Rivals; and arrive to the Possession
of her Heart by many Years of Services and Sidelity.


The Impropriety of receiving a Lover of a
Father's recommending appeared in its strongest
Light. What Lady in Romance ever married
the Man that was chose for her ? In those Cases
the Remonstrances of a Parent are called Persecutions;
obstinate Resistance, Constancy and
Courage; and an Aptitude to dislike the Person
proposed to them, a noble Freedom of Mind
which disdains to love or hate by the Caprice of
others.

.capella, strengthening her own Resolutions
by those Examples of heroic Disobedience, told
her Father, with great Solemnity of Accent,
that fie would always obey him in all just and
reasonable Things; and, being persuaded that
he would never attempt to lay any Force upon
her Inclinations, she would endeavour to make
them conformable to his, and receive her cousin
with that Civility and Friendihip due to so
near a Relation, and a Person whom he honoured
with his Efiem.

The Marquis, having had frequent Occasions
of admiring his Daughter's Eloquence, did not
draw any unpleasing Conclusion from the nice

Distinctions she made; and, being perfectly as-fired
of her Consent whenever he demanded it,
expected the Arrival of his Nephew with great
Impatience.

Arabella, whose Thoughts had been fully
employed since this Cunveril-tion with her Father,
was indulging her Meditations in one of
the molt retired Walks in the Garden; when
Ihe was informed by Lucy, that her Cousin was
come, and that the Marquis had brought him
into the Garden to look for her.
¬∑'That Instant they both entered the Walk,
when Arabella, prepossessed, as she was, against
any favourable Thoughts of the young Glans
could not help betraying some Surprize at
the Gracefulness of his Figure.

It tush be confessed, said the to her Attendant,
with a Smile, that this Lover my Father has
brought us, is no contemptible Person: Nevertheless
I feel an invincible Repugnance in myself
against receiving him in that Character.

As the finished these Words, the Marquis
came up, and presented Mr. Glanville to her;
who, saluting her with the Freedom of a Relation,
gave her disgust that (hewed itself immediately
in her fair Face, which was overspread
with such a Gloom, that the Marquis was quite
astonished at it. Indeed Arabella, who expected
he would hardly have presumed to kiss her Hand,
was so surprised at his Freedom, in attempting
her Lips, that she not only expressed her Indignation
by Frowns, but gave him to understand
he had mortally offended her.

Mr. Glanville, however, was neither surprised
nor angry at her Resentment; but, imputing it

to her Country Education, endeavoured to rally
lier out of her ill Humour; and the Mai cuss, being
glad to find a Behaviour, which he thought
proceeded from her Dislike of her Cousin, was
only an Eab;ct of an over-scrupulous immodesty,
told her that Mr. Glanville had committed no
Offence by diluting her, since tl.at was a Civility
which was granted to all Strangers ;:t the
first Interview, and therefore could not be refused
to a Relation.

Since the World is so degenerate in it's Customs
from what it was formerly, said aealcl/la
with a Smile full of Contempt upon her Cousin,
i am extremely happy in having lived in a solitude
which has not yet exposed me to the
of being a Witness to Manners I cannot
approve; for if every Person I shall meet
with for the future be so descent in their repeat
to Ladies, as my Cousin is, I fillip not care
how much I am secluded from Society.

But, dear Lady Bella, interrupted Mr. Glanville
gaily, tell ice, I beseech you, how I must
behave to please you; for I should be extremely
glad to be honoured with your good Opinion,

The Person, resumed fhc, whom I muss
teach how to acquire my good Opinion, will,
I am afraid, hardly recompense me by his Docility
in learning, for the Pains I should be at in
instructing him.

But, resumed Glanville, that I may avoid anymore
Occasions of offending you, only let me
know how you would be approached for the si-ture.


SiL'.e, answered lie, there is no Necessity to
renew the Ceremony of introducing you again

tn me, I have not a second Affront ouf at Kind
t; apprehend ; but I pray tell meC, If .all C*;ii irs
:!C as presuming as )oure!f; and i' a Rel-ti;ol
i. your Sex does not think a mode: Embrace
frown a Lady a Welcome sufficiently tender "- ?

Nay, Cousin, cried GalmZ,'lc eagerly, I am
nw persuaded you arc in the Right; ;ai; E7-.
[race is certainly to he preferred to a cid Sea
lite. What would I give, that the \lneiiiis
v:ould introduce me a Second time, that I night
be received with so delightful a Welcome ?

The Vivacity with which he spoke this was io
extremely disagreeable to i/rab c/a,that she tun ed
from him abruptly, and, striking into another
Walk, ordered Lucy to tell him he commanded
him not to follow her.

Mr. Glanville, however, who bad no Notion
of the exadc Obedience which was expected
iron him, would have gone after her, notwithstanding
this Prohibition, which Lucy delivered
in a mois peremptory Manner, after her Lady's
Example: But the Marquis, who had left the
two young People at Liberty to discourse, and
had walked on, that he might not interrupt them,
turning about, and seeing Glanville alone, cailcd
him to have tome private Discourse with !nim ;
and, for that time, spared Aralclld the Mortification
of seeing her Commands disobeyed.
The Heroines, tho' they think da Kiss of the Hand a
great Condescension) to a Lover, and never grant it w:lisut
Bltflecs and Confuting; yet make no Scruple to enforce him
upon every lost Absence,

C H A P. IX.
In which a Lover is severely punished for

Faults which the Reader never would
have discovered, if he had not been told.

H E Marquis, tho' he had resolved to give
AT patella to his Nephew, was desirous he
should first receive some Impressions of Tenderness
for her, before he absolutely declared his
Resolution; and ardently willed he might be
able to overcome that Reluctance which the
seemed to have for Marriage: But, tho' Glanville
in a very few Days became passionately in Love
with his charming Coulin, yet flie discovered lb
strong a Dislike to him, that the Marquis feared it
would be difficult to make her receive him for an
Husband: He observed she took all Opportunities
of avoiding his Conversation ; and seemed
always out of Temper when he aldrefled'any
thing to her; but was well enough pleased,
when he discoursed with him; and would listen
to the long Conversations they had together with
great Attention.

The Truth is, she had too much Discernment
not to see Mr. Glanville had a great deal of
Merit; his Person was perfectly handsome; he
possessed a great Share of Understanding, an
easy Temper, and a Vivacity which charmed
every one, but the insensible Arabella.

She often wondered, that a Man, who, as
the tell her Confident, was Master of so many
fine Qualities, should have a Disposition so little
capable of feeling the Passion of Love, with the

Delicacy and Fervour she expclcd to iunfic;
or, that he, whole Conversation was to pleasing
(! every other Subject, should make so poor a
Figure when he entertained her with Matters
cf Gallantry. However, added (he, I should
he to blame to desire to be beloved by Mr. (Clan-til;
for I ann persuaded that Palatin wu,!l!
calc no Reformation in the Coarfenie; of his
Manners to Ladies,which makes him so disagreeable
to me, and might possibly increase my
Aversion.

The Marquis, having studied his Nephew's
Looks for several Days, thought he saw Inclination
enough in them for Arabella, to make
him receive the Knowlege of his Intention with
Joy: He, therefore, called him into his Closet,
and told him in few Words, that, if his Heart
was not pre-engaged, and his Daughter capable
of making him happy, he resolved to bestow
her upon him, together with all his Estates.

Mr. Glanville received this agreeable News
with the strongest Expressions of Gratitude; assuring
his Uncle, that Lady Bella, of all the
Women he had ever seen, was most agreeable
to his Taste; and that he felt for her all the
Tenderness and Affection his Soul was capable
of.

I am glad of it, my dear Nephew, said the
Marquis, embracing him: I will allow you,
added he smiling, but a few Weeks to court her:
Gain her Heart as soon as you can, and when
you bring me her Consent, your Marriage (hall
be solemnized immediately.

Mr. Glanville needed not a Repetition of so
agreeable a Command: He left his Uncle's Closet,

with his Heart 'ille with the E.pi darien of
his ;: pr! c !aching ll happiness; and, un:ler i.?rg
l rial/l;, wa mi the (;Grdcei, he went to her
with a Resolution to acquaint her with the i'er-
niflionl he: Father had given him to make his
Addresses to her.

He found his fair Cough, as usual, accompanied
with her Women; and, seeing that, notwithstanding
his Approach, they fill continued
to walk with her, and impatient of the restraint
they laid him under, I beseech you, confine,
said he, let me have the Pleasure of walking
with you alone: VWhatNeceflity is there for
always having so many Witnesses of our conversation?
You may retire, said he, speaking.
to Lucy, and the other Woman; I have something
to say to your Lady in private.

Stay, I command you, said Arabella,-blufling
at an Insolence so uncommon, and take Orders
from no one but myfelf.-I pray you, Sir, pursued
she frowning, What Intercourse of Secrets
is there between you and me, that you expect
I Should favour you with a private Conversation ?
An Advantage which none of your Sex ever
boasted to have gained from me; and which,
haply, you Should be the last upon whom I
should bestow it.

You have the strangest Notions, answered
Glanville, singling at the pretty Anger Ihe discovered:
Certainly you may hold a private conversation
with any Gentleman, without giving
Offence to Decorum; and I may plead a Right
to this Happiness, above any other,' since I have
the Honour to be your Relation,

It is not at all fu prisons, re;ml;d AI'( rl,/.i
r.v'xclv, that you and I hould difl:r in Opinion
uipoU this Occasion: I don't remember that ever
ree agreed in any thing ; and, I am apt to bc-lice,
we never shall.

Ah! don't say so, Lady Bella, interrupted
he: What a Prospect of Misery you lay before
me ! For, if we are always to be opposite to each
other, it is necessary you muss hate me as much
as I admire and love you.

'I'TreI Words, which he accompanied with
a gentle Pressure of her Hand, threw the alloy
Arabella into such an Excess of Anger
and Shame, that, for a few Moments, she was
unable to utter a Word.

What a horrid Violation this, of all .the
Laws of Gallantry and Respect, which decree
a Lover to sussex whole Years in Silence before
he declares his Flame to the divine Objet that
causes it; and then with awful Trembling, and
submissive Prostrations at the Feet of the offended
Fair!

Arabella could hardly believe her Senses when
she heard declaration, not only made without
the usual Forms, hut also, that the presumptuous
Criminal waited for her Answer, without
seeming to have any Apprehension of the Punishment
to which he was to be doomed ; and
that, instead of deprecating her Wrath, the
looked with a smiling Wonder upon her Eyes
if he did not fear their Li¬∑.hteniiils would
shrike him dead.
Indeed,itwas fcarcepoffiblcfor him tn helpfiii-
ling, and wondering too, at lite extraordinary
Notion of Arabella for, as soon as le had pronounced

lore fatal Words, file tartcd back twin
or three Steps; cast a Look at him full ,f tc
highest Indignation; and, lifting up her fine
Eyes to Heaven, seemed, in the Language ,t'
Romance, to accuse the Gods for fuhjetiin;
her to so cruel an Indignity.

'Ihe Tumult of her Thoughts bern .1 little
fettled, she turned again towardsGia:./'::i,; wvhioe
Countenance expressing nothing of that Confession
and Anxiety common to an Adorer in ;f
critical a Circumstance, her Rage returned with
greater Violence than ever.

If I do not express all the Resentment your insolence
has filled me with, said hee to him, as-acting
more Scorn than Anger, 'tis because I
hold you too mean for my Resentment; but never
hope for my Pardon for your presumptuous
Confession ofaPaffion I could almost despise myself
for inspiring. If it be true that you love me,
go and find your Punishment in that Absence to
which I doom you; and never hope I will sussex
a Person in my Presence, who has affronted mein
the manner you have done.

Saying this, flie walked away, making a Sign
to him not to follow her.

Mr. Glanville, who was at first disposed to
laugh at the strange Manner in which, she received
his Expressions of Seem for her, sound
something, so extremely haughty and contemptuous
in the Speech she had made, that he was
alios mad with Vexation.

As he had no Notion of his Cousin's heroic
Sentiments, and had never read Romances, he
was quite ignorant of the Nature of his Offence
and, supposing the Scorn Ihe had expressed for

hin was founded upon the Difference of their
Rank and Fortune, his Pride was so sensibly
mortified at that Thought, and at her so intently
forbidding him her Presence, that he was
once inclined to slew his Resentment of such ungenteel
Usage, by quitting the Castle without
taking Leave even of the Marquis, who, the
thought, could not be ignorant of the Reception
he was likely to meet with from his Daughter;
and ought to have guarded him against it,
if he really meant him so well as he seemed todo.


As he was extremely violent and hasty in his
Resolutions, and nicely sensible of the least As-front,
he was not in a Condition to reason justly
upon the Marquis's Conduct in this Affair; and
while he was fluctuating with a thousand different
Resolutions, Lucy came to him with a Billet
from her Lady, which she delivered without
flaying till he opened it; and was superscribed
in this Manner:
Arabella, To the moll ptrfiniptuots Man in

yOU seem to acknowlege so little Respite

and Deference for the Commands of a
Lads, that I am afraid it will be but too necessary
to reiterate that, which, at parting, I laid
upon you: Know then, that I absolutely insist
upon your repairing, in the only manner you
are able, the Affront you have put upon me;
which is, by never appearing before me again.
If you think proper to confine me to my Chamber,
by continuing here any louder, you will

add D)ificbbcd!ccc to the Crime by vli,'ll )yot
have already mortally offended

The Superscription of this Letter, and the un -
common Stye of it, pcrliraded Mr. G/l,':vii,,
that what he had been foolish enough to rent
as ai Affront, was dclignd as a Jest, and
meant to divert him as well as herself: He examined
her Behaviour again, and wondered at
his Stupidity in not Discovering it before. His
Rcfelltmcnt vanishing immediately, he returned
to the House; auld went, without Ceremony,
to Jral,'lla's Apartment, which he entered before
she perceived him, being in a profound
Muting at one of the Windows: The Noise he
made, in approaching her, obliged her at lait
to look up ; when, starting as if she had seen a
Basilisk, the flew to her Closet, and, shutting the
Door with great Violence, commanded him to
leave her Chamber immediately.

Mr. Glanville, still supposing her in Jest, intreated
her to open the Door; but, finding she
continued obstinate, Well, said he, going away,
I shall be revenged on you some time hence,
and make you. repent the Tricks you play me
now.

,arabella not being able to imagine any thing,
by these Words he fiske in Raillery, but that
he really, in the Spite and Anguish of his Heart,
threatened her with Executing some terrible Enterprize;
she did not doubt, but he either intended
to carry her away; or, thinking her
Aversion to him proceeded from his having a
Rival happy enough to be esteemed by her, those

minfl'erois, Words he head uttered related to his
Design of killing him; Io that as fine knew, ie
could discover no Rival to wreak his Revenge
upon, the feared, that, at once to tatisf tint
Pailioil as well as his Love, he would make himself
Mater of her Liberty : For, in fine, fated Ihe
to Lucy, to whom she communicated all her
'lhouhlts, have I not every) thing to apprehend
from a Man, who knows lb little how to treat
my Sex with the Refpet which is our Due;
and who, after having, contrary to the timorous
Nature of that Passion, insisted me with a free
Declaration of Love, treated my Commands
with the utmost Contempt by appearing before
me again; and even threatens me with the Revenge
he is meditating at this Moment ?

Had Mr. Glanville been present, and heard
the terrible Misfortunes which she prefagedfroii
the few Words he had jestingly )soke, he soult
certainly have made her quite furious, by the
Diversion her Mistake would have afforded him.
But the more she reflected on his Words, the
more she was persuaded of the terrible Purpose
of them.

'Twas in vain to acquaint her Father with
the Reasons she had for disliking his Choice: His
Resolution was'fixed, and if the did not voluntarily
conform to it, file exposed herself to the
Attempts of a violent and unjust Lover, who
would either prevail upon the Marquis to lay
a Force upon her Inclinations, or make himself
Master of her Person, and never cease persecuting
her, till he had obliged her to give limber
Hand.

Having reasoned herself into a persist Conviction
that all these things nuit necessarily harp.
pen, sic thought it both just and reasonable to
provide for her own Security, by a ficcdy Flight.
'The Want of a Precedent, indeed, fur an ACtion
of this Nature, held her a few Moments in Sus
pense; for she did not remember to have read
of any Heroine that voluntarily left her Father's
liou!C, however persecuted she might be; but reconsidered
that there was not any of the Ladies
in Romances, in the same Circumfiances with
herself who was without a favoured Lover, for
whole sake it might have been believed she had
made an Elopement, which would have been
highly prejudicial to her Glory; and, as there
was no Foundation for any Suspicion of that
Kind in her Case, flie thought there was nothing
to hinder her from withdrawing from a tyrannical
Exertion of parental Authority, and the
secret Machinations of a Lover, whose Aim was
to take away her Liberty, either by obliging her
to marry him, or by making her a Prisoner.

Contains several Incidents, in which the

Reader is expected to be extremely interested.
R Bella had spent some Hours in her

Closet, revolving a thousand different
Stratagems to escape from the Misfortune that

threatened her, when file was interrupted by
Lucy, who, after desiring Admittance, informed
her, that the Marquis, having rode out to take
the Air that Evening, had fallen from his Horse
and received some Hurt; that he was gone to
Bed, and desired to see her.

isabella, hearing her Father was indisposed,
ran to him, excessively alarmed; and reflecting
on the Resolution ile had just before taken, of
leaving him, which aggravated her Concern,
ie came to his Bedside with her Eyes swimming in
Tears. Mr. Gl<, ;:vil/' was sitting near him; but,
riling at her Appearance to give her his Chair,
which she accepted without taking any Notice
of him, he flood at some Defiance contemplating
her Face, to which Sorrow had given
it) many Charms, that hc gazed on her with an
Eagerness and Delight that could not escape her
Observation.

She blushed excessively at the passionate Looks
he gave her; and, finding the Marquis's Indies
considerable enough to oblige her
to a constant Attendance at his iE ed-fine, fne took
the fire Opportunity of returning to Lcr Clamber;
but, as she was going out, Civilly presented
his Hand to lead her up Stairs: Which
fie scornfully refusing;

Sure, Cousin, said he, a little piqedl, you
aren't disposed to carry on your ill-natured Eli
any further
If you imagined Ijeecd with you, fail Arabella,
I am rather to accuse the. Slow,::-Z; cfi, ir
Understanding, for your pcrfitinr- in treatil;n
me thus freely, than the Insolence I first' imputed
it to: But, whatever is the Canis of it,

VOL I. D T

I now tell you again, that you have extremely
offended me; and, if my Father's Illness did
not set Bounds to my Resentment at present, I
would make you know, that I would not super
the Injury you do me, so patiently.
Since you would have me to believe you are serious,
replied Glanville, be pleased to let me
know what Offence it is you complain of; for
I protest I am quite at a Loss to understand
you.

Was it not enough, resumed Arabella, to as-front
me with an insolent Declaration of your
Passion, but you muss also, in Contempt my
Commands to the contrary, appear before me
again, pursue me to my Chamber, and use the
most brutal Menaces to me ?

Hold, pray, Madam, interrupted Glanville,
and sussex me to ask you, If it is my Presumption,
in declaring myself your Admirer, that
you are so extremely offended at?

Doubtless it is, Sir, answered Arabella; and
such a Presumption, as, without the aggravating
Circumstances you have since added to it, is sufficient
to make me always your Enemy.

I beg Pardon, returned Mr. Glanville gravely,
for that Offence; and also, for slaying any
longer in a House, which you have, so genteelly,
turned me out of.

My Pardon, Mr. Glanville, resumed she, is
not so easily gained: Time, and your Repentance,
may, indeed, do much towards obtaining
it.

Saying this, she made a Sign to him to retire;
for he had walked up with her to her Chamber:
But, finding he did not obey her, for really he

was quite unacquainted with these Sorts of dumb
Commands, she hastily retired to her Closet, lest
he should attempt to move her Pity, by any Expressions
of Despair for the cruel Banishment she
had doomed him to.

MIr. Glanville, seeing flie had shut herself up
in her Closet, left her Chamber, and retired to
his own, more confounded than ever at the Behaviour
of his Cousin.

Her bidding him so peremptorily to leave the
House, would have equally persuaded him of
her Ignorance and Ill-breeding, had not the Elegance
of her Manners, in every other respect,
proved the contrary: Nor was it possible to doubt
she had a great Share of Understanding; since
her Conversation, singular as one of her Sentiments
seemed to him, was far superior to most
other Ladies. Therefore, he concluded, the
Affront he had received, proceeded from her
Disdain to admit the Addresses of any Person,
whose Quality was inferior to hers; which,
probably, was increased to some particular Dislike
she had to his Person.

His Honour would not permit him to make
Use of that Advantage her Father's Authority
could give him; and, wholly engrossed by his
Resentment of the Usage he had received from
her, he resolved to set out for London the next
Day without seeing the Marquis, from whom
he was apprehensive of tome Endeavours to detain
him.
Having taken this Resolution, he ordered his
Servant to have the Horses ready early in the
Morning; and, without taking any Notice of
his Intention, he left the CalHle, riding, as fait

as possible, to the next Stage, from whence he
wrote to his Uncle ; and, dispatching a ?Jeliii-
ger with his Letter, held on his Way to London.


The Marquis, being pretty well recovered
from his Indisposition by a good Night's Rest,
flat for Mr. Glanville in the Morning, to walk
with him, as was his Custom, in the Garden ;
but, hearing he had rode out, tho' he imagined
it was only to take the Air, yet he could not
help accusing him, in his own Thoughts, of a
little Neglect; for which he resolved to chide
him, when he returned: But his long Stay filling
him with some Surprize, he was beginning
to express his Fears that something had befallen
him, to arabella, who was then with him; when
a Servant presented him the Letter, which Mr.
Glanville's Messenger had that Moment brought.

The Marquis casting his Eyes on the direction,
and knowing his Nephew's Hand, Bless
me, cried he, extremely surprised, What can
this mean? Bella, added he, here's a Letter
from your Cousin.

Arabella, at these Words, started up; and,
preventing her Father, with a respectful Action,
from opening it, I beseech you, my Lord, said
she, before you read this Letter, sussex me-to
assure you, that, if it contains any thing fatal,
I am not at all accessary to it: 'Tis true I have
banished my Cousin, as a Punishment for the
Offence he was guilty of towards me; but, Heaven
is my Winnie, I did not design his Death;
and if he has taken any violent Resolution against
himself, he has greatly exceeded my Commands.


'she Marquis, v.-hfe Surprize was considerable
iicrcaied bv these Words, hastily broke
open ti Letter, which Ihe perceiving, hurried
out of the Rocpm; and, locking herself up in
her Closet, began to bewail the Effect of her
Charms, as if Ihe was perfectly assured of her
Coupling's Death.

The Marquis, however, who, from Lad(r
Bella's Exclamation, had prepared himfiefior tie
Knowlege of home very extraordinary Accident,
was less surprised, than he would otherwise have
been, at the Contents; which were as follow:

AS my leaving your House so abruptly will

certainly make me appear guilty of a most
unpardonable Rudeness, I cannot dispense with
myself from acquainting your Lordship with the
Cause; though, to spare the Reproaches Lady
Bella will probably cast on me for doing so, I
could wish you knew it by any other Means.

But, my Lord, I value your Esteem too mulch
to hazard the Loss of it by suffering you to imagine,
that I am capable of doing any thing to
displease you. Lady Bella was pleased to order
me to stay no longer in the House; and menaced
me with some very terrible Usage, if I disobeyed
her: She used so many other contemptuous Expressions
to me, that, I am persuaded, I stall
never be so happy as to possess the Honour you
designed for,

D 3 When

When the Marquis had read this Letter, he
went to his Daughter's Apartment with an Intention
to chide her severely for her Usage of his
Nephew; but, seeing her come to meet him
with her Eyes bathed in Tears, he insensibly
lost some Part of his Resentment.

Alas! my Lord, said (he, I know you come
prepared to load me with Reproaches, upon my
Cousin's Account; but, I beseech your lordship,
do not aggravate my Sorrows: Tho' I banished
Mr. Glanville', I did not desire his Death;
and, questionless, if he knew how I resent it,
his Ghost would be satisfied with the Sacrifice
I make him.

The Marquis, not being able to help singling
at this Conceit, which he saw had so strongly
possessed her Imagination, that tfe had no sort
of Doubt but that her Cousin was dead, asked
her, If (he really believed Mr. Glanville loved
her well enough to die with Grief at her ill Usage
of him ?

If, said he, he loves me not well enough to
die for me, he certainly loves me but little i and
I am the less obliged to him.

But I desire to know, interrupted the Marquis,
For what Crime it was you took the Liberty
to banish him from my House ?

I banished him, my Lord, resumed she, for
his Presumption in telling me he loved me.

That Presumption, as you call it, tho' I
know not for what Reason, said the Marquis,
was authorized by me: Therefore, know, Bella,
tht I not only permit him to love you, but I
also expect you (hould endeavour to return his
Affection; and look upon him as the Man

whom I design for your Husband: There's his
Letter, pursued he, putting it into her Hand.
I blush for the Rudeness you have been guilty
of; but endeavour to repair it, by a more obliging
Behaviour for the future: I am going to
send after him immediately to prevail upon to
return: Therefore, write him an Apology, I
charge you ; alt have it done by the Timely
Messenger is ready to sat out.

Saying this, he went out of the Room; and
Arabella eagerly opened the Letter; and, finding
it in a Style so different from what the expected,
her Dislike of him returned with more Violence
than ever.

Ah ! the Traitor! laid the aloud, Is it thus
that he endeavours to move my Comparison ?
How greatly did I over-rate his Affection, when
I imagined his Despair was capable of killing
him? Disloyal Man! pursued she, walking
about, Is it by Complaints to my Father that
thou expedient to succeed ? And dost thou imagine
the Heart of Arabella is to be won by Violence
and Injustice ?

In this manner the wasted the Time allotted
for her to write; and, when the Marquis sent.
for her Letter, having no Intention to comply,
she went to his Chamber, conjuring him not to
oblige her to a Condescension so unworthy of
her.

The Marquis, being now excessively angry
with her, rose up in a Fury, and, leading her
to his Writing-desk, ordered her, instantly, to
write to her Cous.

If I must write, my Lord, said she, sobbing,
pray be so good as to dictate what I must say.

Acids?, c ior your rude Behaviour, said the
vMal;iuis; and dlO1sre him, in the most obliging
mnalincr you call, to return.

ilrar/;'a, fc;i:2 there was a necessity for obeying,
took up the Pen, and wrote the following
Billet: ,Th, zifnrtu;:ate Arabella, to the ;?i ungenerous

IT is not b;. the Power I have over you, that
a I command you to return, for I disclaim any
Empire over so unworthy a Subject; but, since
it is my Father's Pleasure I should invite you
back, I must let you know, that I repeal your
Banishment, and expect you will immediately
return with theMcefenger who brings this; however,
to spare your Acknowlegements, know,
that it is in Obedience to my Father's absolute
Commands, that you receive this Mandate
from

Having finished this Billet, she gave it to the
Marquis to read; who, finding a great deal of
his own Haughtiness of Temper in it, could not
resolve to check her for a Disposition so like his
own: Yet he told her, fertile was very uncommon:
And pray, added he, smiling, who taught
you to superscribe your Letters thus, " The unfortunate
Arabella, to the most ungenerous
"Glanville?" Why, Bella, thisSuperfcription is
wholly calculated for the Bearer's Information:
But come, alter it immediately; for I don't
choose my Messenger should know, that you

are unfortunate, or that my Nephew is ungenerous.


Pray, my Lord, replied Arabella, content
yourself with what I have already done in Obedience
to your Commands, and sussex my Letter
to remain as it is: Methinks it is hut reasonable
I should express some little Resentment at the
Complaint my Cousin has been pleated to make
to you against me; nor can I possibly make my
Letter. more obliging, without being guilty of
an unpardonable Meanness.

You are a strange Girl, replied the Marquis,
taking the Letter, and inclosing it in one from
himself; in which he earnestly intreated his
Nephew to return, threatening him with his
Displeasure, if he disobeyed; and assuring him,
that his Daughter would receive him as well a:;
he could possibly desire.

The Messenger being dispatched, with Orders
to ride Post, and overtake the young Gentleman,
he obeyed his Orders so well, that he came
up with him at -, where lie intended to lodge
that Night.

Mr. Glanville, who expected his Uncle would
make use of some Methods to recal him, opened
his Letter without any great Emotion; but feeing
another inclosed, his Heart leaped to his'
Mouth, not doubting but it was a Letter from
Arabella; but the Contents surprised him so
much, that he hardly knew whether he ought to
look upon them as an Invitation to return, ora
new Affront, her Words were so distant and
haughty. The Superscription being much the
same with a Billet he had received som her in
the Garden, which had made him conclude her

D 5 ia

in Jest, he knew not what to think of it: One
would swear this dears Girl's Head is turned,
said he to himself, if the had not more Wit than
her whole Sex besides.

After reading Arabella's Letter several times,
he at last opened his Uncle's; and, seeing the
prefixing Instances he made him to return, he
resolved to obey; and the next Morning set out
for the Cattle.

Arabella, during the time her Cousin was
expected, appeared so melancholy and reserved,
that the Marquis was extremely uneasy: You
have never, said he to her, disobeyed me in anyone
Sion of your Life; and I may with reason
expect you will conform to myWill in theChoice
I have made of a Husband for you, finch it is
impossible to make any Objection either to his
Person or Mind; and, being the Son of my
Sister, he is certainly not unworthy of you, tho'
he has not a Title.

My first Wish, my Lord, replied Arabella, is
to live single, not being desirous of entering into
any Engagement which may hinder my Solicitude
and Cares, and lessen my Attendance, upon
the best of Fathers, who, till now, has always
most tenderly complied with my Inclinations
in every thing: But if it is your absolute Command,
that I should marry, give me not to one
who, tho' he has the Honour to be allied to you,
has neither merited you ref teem, or my Favour,
by any Action worthy of his Birth, or the Passion
he pretends to have for me; for, in fine,
my Lord, by what Services has he deserved the
Dissipation with which you honour him ? Has
he ever delivered you from any considerable

Danger? Has he saved your Life, and hazarded
his own, for you, upon any Occasion whatever ?
Has he merited my Esteem, by his Sufferings,,
Fidelity, and Refpet; or, by any great and
generous Dion, given me a Testimony of his
Love, which should oblige me to reward him
with my Affection ? Ah! my Lord, I beseech
you, think not so unworthily of your Daughter,
as to below her upon one who has done so
little to deserve her: If my Happiness be dear
to you, do not precipitate me into a State from.
whence you cannot recal me, with a Person
whom I can never asset.

She would have gone on, but the Marquis interrupted
her sternly: Ill hear no more, said'
he, of your foolish and ridiculous Objections:
What Stuff is this you talk of ? What Service.
am I to expect from my Nephew? And by
what Sufferings is he to merit your Esteem?
Assure yourself, Arabella, continued he, that
I will never pardon you, if you presume to treat
my Nephew in the Manner you have done: I
perceive you have no real Objection to make to
him; therefore I ex!pct you will endeavour to
obey me without Reluctance; for, since you
seem to be so little acquainted with what will
most conduce to your own Happiness, you turf
not think it strange, if I insist upon directing
your Choice in the most important Business of
your Life.

Arabella was going to reply; but the Marquis
ordered her to be silent; and she went to her
own Apartment in so much Affliction, that she
thought her Misfortunes were not exceeded by
any the had ever read.

D 6 Clap,

CHA P. XI.
In which a logical Argument is unseasonably

into trusted.
HE Marquis was also extremely uneasy
T at her Obstinacy: He desired nothing more
ardently than to marry her to his Nephew; but
he could not resolve to force her Consent; and,
however determined he appeared to her, yet,
il Reality, te intended only to use Persuasions
to efliec what he desired; and, from the natural
Sweetness of her Temper, he was sometimes
not with' t Hopes, that she might, at last, be
prevailed upon to comply.

His Nephew's Return restored him to Part of
his usual Tranquillity: After he had gently chid
him for fuffcrillg himself to be so far transported
with his Resentment at the little Humours of a
Lady, as to leave his House, without acquainting
him, he bid him go to Arabella, and endeavour
to make his Peace with her.

Mr. Glanville accordingly went to her apartment,
resolving to oblige her to come to some
Explanation with him concerning the Offence
C.e complained of; but that fair incensed Lady,
who had taken Shelter in her Closet, ordered
Lucy to tell him flie was indisposed, and could
not lee him.

Glanville, however, comforted himself for
this Disappointment by the Hopes of seeing herat
Supper; and accordingly fne came, when the
Supper-Bell rung and, making a very cool compliment
to her Cousin, placed herself at Table:

The soft Languor that appeared in her Eyes,
gave such an additional Charm to one of the
loveliest Faces in the ¬¢World, that Glanville,
who sat opposite to her, could not help gazing
on her with a very particular Attention ; he
often spoke to her, and asked her trifling Questions,
for the sake of hearing the Sound of her
Voice, which Sorrow had made enchantingly
sweet.

When Supper was over, she would have retired;
but the Marquis desired her to slay ant
entertain lier cou sin, while he went to look over
some Dispatches he had received from London.

Arabella blushed with Anger at this Command;
but, not daring to disobey, she kept her
Eyes fixed on the Ground, as if she dreaded to
hear something that would displease her.

Well, Cousin, said Glanville, tho' you desire
to have no Empire over so unworthy a Subject
as myself, yet I hope you are not displeased at
my returning, in Obedience to your Commands.

Since I am not allowed any Will of my own,
said she, sighing, it matters not whether I arm
pleased, or displeased; nor is it of aly Consequence
to you to know.

Indeed but it is, Lady Bella, interrupted he;
for if I knew how to please you, I would never,
if I could help it, offend: Therefore, I beg you,
tell me how I have disobliged you; for, certainly,
you have treated me as harshly as if I had bccn
guilty of some very terrible Offence.

You had the Boldness, said se, to talk tome
of Love; and you well know that Persons
of my Sex and Quality are not permitted to

listen to such Discourses; and if, for that Offence,
I banished you my Presence, I did no
more than Decencyrequired of me; and which
I would yet do, were I Mistress of my own
Actions.

But is it possible, Cousin, said Glanville, that
you can be angry with any one for loving you ?
Is that a Crime of so high a Nature as to merit
an eternal Banishment from your Presence ?

Without telling you, said Arabella, blushing;
whether I am angry at being loved, 'tis sufficient
you know, that I will not pardon the Man who
Shall have thePrefumption to tell me he loves me.

But, Madam, interrupted Glanville, if the
Person who tells you he loves you, be of a
Rank not beneath you, I conceive you are not
at all injured by the favourable Sentiments he
feels for you; and, tho' you are not disposed to
make any returns to his Passion, yet you are certainly
obliged to him for his good Opinion.

Since Love is not voluntary, replied Arabella,
1 am not obliged to any Person for loving me;
for, questionless, if he could help it, he would.

If it is not a voluntary Favour, interrupted
Glanville, it is not a voluntary Offence; and, if
you do not think yourself obliged by the one,
neither are you at Liberty to be offended with.
the other.

The Question, said Arabella, is not whether.
I ought to be offended at being loved, but
whether it is not an Offence to be told I am so

If there is nothing criminal in the Passion itself,
Madam, resumed Glanville, certainly there
can be no Crime in declaring it.

However fpeciousyourArgume ants may appear,
interrupted arabella, I am persuaded it is an
unpardonable Crime to tell a Lady you love
her; and, tho' I had nothing else to plead, yet
the Authority of Custom is sufficient to prove it.

Custom, Lady Bella, said Glanville, smiling,
is wholly on my Side; for the Ladies are so far
from being displeased at the Addresses of their
Lovers, that their chiefs Care is to gain them,
and their greatest Triumph to hear them talk of
their Passion: So, Madam, I hope you'll allow
that Argument has no Force.

Don't know, answered Arabella, what Sort
of Ladies there are who allow such unbecoming
Liberties, but I am certain, that Station,.
Parifatis, Clelia, Mandana, and all the illustrious
Heroines of Antiquity, whom it is a Glory
to resemble, would never admit of such Discourses.


Ah for Heaven's sake, Cousin, interrupted;
Glanville, endeavouring toflifle a Laugh,. do not
suffer yourself to be governed by such antiquated
Maxims ! The World is quite different to what
it was in those Days; and the Ladies in this
Age would as soon follow the Fashions of the
Greek and Roman Ladies, as mimick their
Manners; and I believe they would become one
as ill as the other.

I am sure, replied Arabella, the World is not
more virtuous now than it was in their Days,
and there is good Reason to believe it is not
much wiser; and I don't see why the Manners
of this Age are to be preferred to those of former
ones, unless they are wiser and better:
However, I cannot be persuaded, that Things

are as you say, and that when I am a little better
acquainted with the World, I illall hind as Any
Persons who resemble Oroosndatcs, Artaxerxes,
and the illustrious Lovers of Cltlia, as those
who are like Tiribafis, r-taxcs, and the presuming
and insolent Glanville.

By the Epithets you give me Madam, said
Glanville, I find you have placed me in very
bad Company: But pray, Madam, if the
illustrious Lover of Clelia had never discovered
his Passion, how would the World have come
to the Knowlege of it?

He did not discover his Passion, Fir, resumed
Arabella, till, by the Services he did the noble
Celsus, and his incomparable Daughter, he
could plead fomeTitle to their Esteem : He several
times preserved the Life of that renowned
Roman; delivered the beautiful (Celia when
flc was a Captive; and, in fine, conferred so
many Obligations upon them, and all their
Friends, as he might well expect to be pardoned
by the divine Clelia for daring to love
her. Nevertheless, flie used him very harshly,
when he first declared his Passion, and banished
him also from her Presence; and it was a longtime
before The could prevail upon herself to
compassionate his Sufferings.

The Marquis coming in interrupted Arabella;
upon which he took Occasion to retire;
leaving Glanville more captivated with her than
ever.

He found her Usage of him was grounded
upon Examples she thought it her Duty to follow;
and, strange as her Notions of Life appeared,
yet they were supported with so much

Wit and Delicacy, that he could not help admiring
her, while he foresaw, the Oddity of her
Humour would throw innumerable Difficulties
in his WVay, before he should be able to obtain
her.

However, as he was really passionately in
Love with her, he resolved to accommodate
himself, as much as possible, to her Tance, and
endeavour to gain her Heart by a Behaviour
most agreeable to her: He therefore assumed an
Air of great Distance and Respect; never mentioned
his Affection, nor the Intentions of her
Father in his Favour; and the Marquis, observing
his Daughter converted with him with
lets Reluctance than usual, leaving to Time,
and the Merit of his Nephew, to dispose her to
comply with his Desires, resolved not to interpose
his Authority in an Affair upon which her
own Happiness so much depended.

of the true Pathetic, in a Speech of
Oroondates.-The Adventure of the
Books.
4 Arabella saw the Change in her

Cousin's Behaviour with a great deal of
Satisfaction; for she did not doubt but his Passion
was as firing as ever; but that he forbore,
thro' RespeCt, from entertaining her with any

Expressions of it: 'Therefore fie now conversed
with him with the greatest Sweetness and complaisance:
She wonid walkwith him for several
Hours in the Garden, leaning upon his Arm;
and charmed him to the last Degree of Admiration
by the agreeable Sallies of her Wit, and
her fine Reasoning upon every Sujet he proposed.


It was with the greater Difficulty he restrained
himself from telling her a 'Thousand times a
Day that he loved hero Excels, and conjuring
her to give her Consent to her Father's Designs
in his Favour: But, tho' he could get over
his Fears of offending her, yet it was impossible
to express any Sentiments of this Nature to her,
without having her Women Witnesses of his
Discourse; for, when he walked with her in
the Garden, Lucy, and another Attendant, always
followed her: If he sat with her in her
own Chamber, her Women were always at one
End of it: And, when they were both in the
Marquis's Apartment, where her Women did'
not follow her, poor Glanville found himself
embarrassed by his Presence; for, conceiving
his Nephew had Opportunities enough of talking
to his Daughters private, he always partook
of their Conversation.

He passed some Weeks in this Manner, extremely
chagrined at the little Progress he made;
and was beginning to be heartily weary of the
Constraint he laid upon himself, when Arabella,
one Day, furnished him, without designing it,
with an Opportunity of talking to heron the
Subject he wield for.

When I reeled, said she, laughing, upon the
Difference there was between us Ime Days
ago, and the Familiarity in which we live at
prefers, I cannot imagine by what means you
have arrived to a good Fortune you had so little
Reason to expect; for, in fine, you have given
me no Signs of Repentance for the Fault you
committed, which moved me to banish you;
and I am not certain whether, in conversing
with you in the manner I do, I give you not as
much Reason to find Fault with my too great
Easiness, as you did me to be displeased with
your Presumption.

Since, returned Glanville, I have not persisted
in the Commission of those Faults which displeased
you, what greater Signs of Repentance
can you desire, than this Reformation in my Behaviour
?

But Repentance ought to precede Reformation,
replied Arabella; otherwise, there is great
room to suspect it is only feigned: And a sincere
Repentance thews itself in ufch visible Marks,
that one can hardly be deceived in that which is.
genuine. I have read of many indiscreet Lovers,
who not succeeding in their Address, have
pretended to repent, and aced as you do; that
is, without giving july Signs of Contrition for
the Fault they had committed, have eat and
slept well, never los their Colour, or grew one
bit thinner, by their Sorrow; but contented
themselves with saying they repented; and,
without changing their Disposition to renew
their Fault, only concealed their Intention, for
fear of losing any favourable Opportunity of
committing it again: But true Repentance, as

i was lfaini,, not only produces Reforming,
but the Person who is p ofifii l of it vol ntaii;
punishes himself si) the F:'!lt he has b,,
guilty of. Thus AIazarcs, d.'e lv repenting vt'
the Crime his Passion for the divine Ala:,*!,.,
had forced him to commit ;:s a Plniihmn.;,
obliged himself to follows the So! 'ane ofr Ils
glorious Rival; obey all his C'onl!m: ndi ;:i.1,
fighting under his I;l;::.rs', ; tis him to-:'il
the Possession of his :ilorcd I 'l
'iicrl . Such a
glorious Instance of SelF-denial was, indeed, a
sufficient Proof of his Repentance; and infinitely
more convincing than the Silence he imposed
upon himself with refpeE to his Passion.

Oroondates, to punish himself for his presumption,
in daring to tell the admirable Station,
that he loved her, resolved to die, to expiate
his Crime; and, doubtless, would have done soif
his fair Mistress, at the Intreaty of her Brother,
had not commanded him to live.

But pray, Lady Bella, interrupted Glanville,
were not these Gentlemen happy at last in the
Possession of their Mistresses ?

Doubtless they were, Sir, resumed she; but
it was not till after numberless Misfortunes, ,
and many dangerousAdventures,
in which their Fidelity was put to the strongest
Trials imaginable.

I am glad, however, said Glanville, that the
Ladies were not insensible; for, since you do
not disapprove of their Compafion for their
Lovers, it is to be hoped you will not be always
as inexorable as you are now.

When I shall be so fortunate, interrupted Ihe,
to meet with a Lover who shall have as pure

ai p"';feit a Passion for me, as Oroondates had
i:r S'l;i 'a; and give me as many glorious
proofs . his Constancy and Assertion, doubtless
I fli 11 not be ungrateful: But, since I have
not the inherits of Statira, I ought not to pretend
to her good Fortune i and hall be very
well contented if I escape the Persecutions which
Pcrlfns of my Sex, who are not frightfully ugly,
are always exposed to, without hoping to inspire
such a Passion as that of Oroondlatcs.
I should be glad to be better acquainted with
the Actions of this happy Lover, Madam, laid
Glanville; that, forming myself upon his Example,
I may hope to please a Lady as worthy
of my Regard as Statira was of his.
For Heaven's sake, Coulin, refined Araltllt,
laughing, how have you spent your Time;
and to what Studies have you devoted all your
Hours, that you could find none to spare for
the Perusal of Books from which all useful
Knowlege may be drawn; which give us the
most fining Examples of Generosity, .Courage,
Virtue, and Love i which regulate our Ations,
firm our Manners, and inspire us with a noble
Desire of emulating thole great, heroic, and
virtuous Actions, which made those Pcrlbns so
glorious in their Age, and so worthy Imitation
in ours? However, as it is never too late to
improve, sussex me to recommend to you the
reading of these Books, which will soon make
you discover the Improprieties you have been
guilty of; and will, probably, induce you to
avoid them for the future.

I shall certainly read them, if you desire it,
said Glanville; and I have so great an Inclination

to be agreeable to you, that I shall embrace
every Opportunity of becoming so; ,;dl
will therefore take my Instructions from the!
Books, if you think proper, or from yourself;
which, indeed, will be the quickest Method of
teaching me.

Arabella having ordered one of her Women
to bring Cleopatra, Cassandra, Clelia, and the
Grand Cyrus, from her Library, Glanville no
sooner saw the Girl return, finking under the
Weight of those voluminous Romances, but he
began to tremble at the Apprehension of his
Cousin laving her Commands upon him to read
them; and repented of his Complaisance, which
exposed him to the cruel Necessity of performing
what to him appeared an Herculean Labour, or
else incurring her Anger by his Refusal.

Arabella, making herdsmen place theBooks
upon a Table before her, opened them, one
after another, with Eyes sparkling with Delight;
while Glanville sat rapt in Admiration at the
Sight of so many huge Folio's, written, as he
conceived, upon the most trifling Subjects
imaginable.

I have chosen out there few, said Arabella
(not observing his Consternation) from a great
many others, which compose the most valuable
Part of my'Library; and, by that time.you
have gone thro' there, I imagine you will be
considerably improved.

Certainly, Madam, replied Glanville, turning
over the Leaves in great Confusion, one
may, as you say, be greatly improved; for these
Books contain a great deal: And, looking over
a Page of Cassandra, without any Design, read

these Words, which were Part of Oroondacte's
Soliloquy when he received a cruel Sentence
from Statirti; :

Ah cruel! says this miserable Lover, and
what have I done to merit it? Examine the
Nature of my Offence, and you will see I am
not so guilty, but that meath may free me
from Part of that Severity: Shall your Hatred

last longer than my Life ? And can you detest
a Soul that forsakes its Body only to obey
you ? No, no, you are not so hard-hearted;
that Satisfaction will, doubtless, content you:

And, when I shall cafe to be, doubtless I
stall cease to be odious to you."

Upon my Soul, said Glanville, trifling a
Laugh with great Difficulty, I cannot help
blaming the Lady this sorrowful Lover complains
of, for her great Cruelty; for here he
gives one Reason to suspect, that she will not
even be contented with his dying in Obedience
to her Commands, but will hate him after
Death; an Impiety quite inexcusable in a
Christian!

You condemn this illustrious Princess with
very little Reason, interrupted Arabella, smiling
at his Mistake; for, besides that she was not a
Christian, and ignorant of those Divine Maxims
of Charity and Forgiveness, which Christians,
by their Profession, are obliged to practise, she
was very far from desiring the' Death of Ordinates
i for, if you will take the Pains to read
the succeeding Passages, you will find that she
expresses herself in the most obliging Manner in
the World; for when Oroondates tells her he
would live, if the would consent lie should, the

Princess mois sweetly replies, " I not only conic
sent, but also intreat it; and, if I have any
Power, command it." However, left you
should fall into the other Extreme, and blame
this crcalt Princess for her Easiness (as you before
condemned her for her Cruelty), 'tis necessary
you should know how fne was induced to
this favourable Behaviour to her Lover: Therefore
pray read the whole Transaction. Stay
here it begins, continued she; turning over a
good many Pages, and marking where he should
begin to read.

,Glanville, having no great Stomach to the
Talk, endeavoured to evade it, by intreating
his Cousin to relate the Pl;flages fine desired he
should be acquainted with: But he declining it,
he was obliged to obey; and began to read
where she directed him: And, to leave him at
Liberty to read with the greater Attention, ic
left him, and went to a Window at another
End of the Chamber.

Mr. Glanville, who was not willing to displease
her, examined the Talk she had set him,
resolving, if it was not a very hard one, to
comply ; but, counting the Pages, he was quite
terrified at the Number, and could not prevail
upon himself to read them: Therefore, glancing
them over, he pretended to be deeply engaged
in reading, when, in Reality, he was contemplating
the surprising Efftcc these Books had
produced in the Mind of his Cousin; who,
had (he been untainted with the ridiculous
Whims they created in her Imagination, was,
in his Opinion, one of the most accomplished
Ladies in the World.

When he had sat long enough to make her
believe he had read what the had desired, he
rose up, and, joining her at the Window, began
to talk of the Pleasantness of the Evening, instead
of the Rigour of Statira.

Arabella coloured with Vexation at his extreme
Indifference in a Matter which was of
filch prodigious Consequence, in her Opinion;
but disdaining put him in mind of his Rude-nets,
in quitting a' SubjeA they had not
thoroughly discussed, and which the had taken
so much Pains to make him comprehend, she
continued silent; and would not condescend to
afford him an Answer to any thing he said.

Glanville, by her Silence and Frowns, was
made sensible of his Fault; and, to repair it,
began to talk of the inexorable Statira, though,
indeed, he did not well know what to say.

Arabella, clearing up a little, did not disdain
to answer him upon her favourite Topic: I
knew, said the, you would be ready to blame
this Princess equally for her Rigour and her
Kindness; but it must be remembred that,
what the did in Favour of Oroondatne, was
wholly owing to the Generosity of Artaxerxes.

Here she flopped, expecting Glanville to give
his Opinion; who, strangely puzzled, replied
at random, To be lure, Madam, he was a very
generous Rival.

Rival ! cried Arabella; Artaxerxes the Rival
.of Oroondates ! Why certainly you have lost your
Wits: He was Statira's Brother; and it was to
his Mediation that Oroondates, or Orontes, owed
his Happiness.

VOL.L E Uncertainly,

Madam, replied Glanville, it was
very generous in .artaxerxes, as he was Brother
to Satire, to interpose in the Behalf of an unfortunate
Lover; and both Oroondates, and
Orontes, were extremely obliged to him.

Orontes, replied Arabella, was more obliged
to him than Oroondutes; since the Quality of
Orontes was infinitely below that of Oroondates.

But, Madam, interrupted Glanville (extremely
pleased at his having so Well got over the Difficulty
he had been in), which of these two
Lovers did Statira make happy ?

This unlucky Question immediately informed
Arabella, that me had been all this time the
Dupe of her Cousin; who, if he had read a
single Page, would have known that Orontes
and Oroondates was the same Person; the Name
of Orontes being assumed by Oroondates, to conceal
his real Name and Quality.

The Shame and Rage the conceived at so
glaring a Proof of his Disrespect, and the Ridicule
to which she had exposed herself, were 1o
great, that the could not find Words severe
enough to express her Resentment; but, protesting
that no Consideration whatever Should
oblige her to converse with him again, the ordered
him instantly to quit her Chamber;
and assured him, if he ever attempted to approach
her again, she would submit to the molt
terrible Sites of her Father's Resentment, rather
than be obliged to see a Person who had,
by his unworthy Behaviour, made himself her
Scorn and Aversion.

Glanville, who saw himself going to be discarded
a second time, attempted, with great

Submission, to move her to recal her cruel
Sentence; but Arabella, bursting into Tears,
complained so pathetically of the Cruelty of her
Destiny, in exposing her to the hated Importunities
of a Man she defpiltld, and whose Pre.
fence was so insupportable, that Gi:z'iilet, thinking
it best to let her Rage evaporate before he
attempted to pacify her, quitted her Chamber;
cursing Statira and Orontes a thoufandltimes,
and loading the Authors of those Books with all.
the Imprecations his Rage could suggest.

The Adventure of the Books continued.
N this Temper he went to the Gardens to
I pas over the Chagrin this unfortunate Accident
had given him; when, meeting the Marquis,
who insisted upon knowing the Cause of
that ill Humour, so visible in his Countenance,
Glanville related all that had passed; but, in
Spite of his Anger, it was impossible for him
to repeat the Circumfiances of his Disgrace
without laughing, as well as the Marquis ; who
thought the Story so extremely divesting, that
he would needs hear it over again.

However, Cbarles; laid he, though I shall do
what I can to gain your Pardon from Bella, yet
I hall not scruple to own you acted extremely
wrong, in not reading what fie desired you;
for, besides losing an Opportunity of obliging
her, you drew yourself into a terrible Dilemma;

E2 ' f

for how was it possible for you to evade a Discovery
of the Cheat you put upon her, when
she began to talk with you upon those Passages
The had desired you to read ?

I acknowlege my Error, my Lord, answered
Glanville; but if you restore me to my Cousin's
Favour again, I promise you to repair it by a
different Behaviour for the future.

I'll see what I can do for you, said the Marquis;
leaving him, to go to Arabella's Apartment,
who had retired to her Closet, extremely
afflicted at this new Insult she had received
from her Cousin: Her Grief was the more
poignant, as he was beginning to imagine, by
the Alteration in his Behaviour, that he would
prove such a Lover as the wished; for Mr.
Glanville's Person and Qualifications had attracted
her particular Notice: And, to speak
in the Language of Romance, (he did not hate
him; but, on the contrary, was very much
diffused towifh him well: Therefore, it was no
Wonder she extremely resented the Affront she
had received from him.
The Marquis, not finding her in her Chamber,
proceeded to her Closet, where her Women
informed him she was retired; and, knocking
gently at the Door, was admitted by arabella'
whom he immediately discerned to have been
weeping very much; for her fine Eyes were red
and swelled, and the Traces of her Tears might
frill be observed on her fair Face; which, at the
Sight of the Marquis, was overspread with a
Blush, as if the was conscious of her Weak.
news in lamenting the Crime her Cousin had been
pity of.

The Marquis drew a favourable Omen for his
Nephew from her Tears and Confusion; but,
not willing to increase it, by acknowleging he
had observed it, he told her he was come, at
Mr. Glanville's Request, to make up the Quarrel
between them.

Ah! my Lord, interrupted .patella, speak
no more to me of that unworthy Man, who
has so grossly amused my Favour, and the Privilege
1 allowed him: His Baseness and Ingratitude
are but too manifest; and there is nothing
I so much regret as my Weakness in restoring
him to Part of my good Opinion, after he had
once forfeited it, by an Insolence not to be paralleled.


Indeed, Bella, said the Marquis, smiling, you
resent too deeply these slight Matters: I can't
think my Nephew so guilty as you would have
me believe he is; and you ought neither to be
angry or surprised, that he preferred your conversation
before reading in a foolish old-fashioned
Book that you put in his Hands.

If your Lordship had ever read there Books,
replied Arabella, reddening with Vexation, 'tis
probable you would have another Opinion of
them; but, however that may be, my Coufm is
not to be excused for the Contempt he shewed
to my Commands; and for daring, by the Cheat
he put on me, to expose me to the Shame of
seeing myself so ridiculoufly-impofed upon.

However, you must forgive him, said the
Marquis; and I insist upon it, before I quit your
Apartment, that you receive him into Favour.

Pardon me, my Lord, replied Arabella; this
is what I neither can, nor ought to do; and I

E 3 hope

hope you will not wrong me so much as to
continue to desire it.

Nay, Bella, said he, this is carrying Things
too far, and making trifling Dispute of too
great Consequence: I am surprised at your
Treatment of a Man whom, after all, if ever
you intend to obey me, you mus consent to
marry.

There is no Question, my Lord, replied she,
hut it would be my Glory to obey you in whatever
is possible; but this you command me now
to do, not being so, I conceive you will rather
impute my Refusal to Necessity, than Choice.

How! returned the Marquis, will you endeavour
to persuade me, that it is not possible
Mir. Glanville should be your Husband ?

'Tis impossible he should be so with my Consent,
resumed Arabella; and I cannot give it
without wounding my own Quiet in a most
sensible manner.

Come, come, Bella, said the Marquis (fretting
at her extreme Obstinacy), this is too much:
1 am to blame to indulge your Foibles in this
Manner: Your Cousin is worthy of your assertion,
and you cannot refuse it to him without
incurring my Displeasure.

Since my Affection is not in my own Power
to bestow, said Arabella, weeping, I know not
how to remove your Displeasure; but, questionless,
I know how to die, to avoid the EffeCts
of what would be to me the most terrible Misfortune
in the World.

Foolish Girl! interrupted the Marquis, how
strangely sto you talk ? Are the Thoughts of

Death become so familiar to you, that you speak
of dying with so little Concern ?

Since, my Lord, resumed the, in an exalted
Tone, Ido not yield, either inV virtue or Courage,
to many others of my Sex, who, when perse
cited like me, have fled to Death for Relief, i
know not why I should be thought less capable
of it than they; and if Jirtimifa, Candace, and
the beautiful Daughter of Cleopatra, could brave
the Terrors of Death for the sake of the Men
they loved, there is no Question but I also could
imitate their Courage, to avoid the Man I have
so much Reason to hate.

The Girl is certainly distracted, interrupted
the Marquis, excessively enraged at the strange
Speech she had uttered: These foolish Books my
Nephew talks of have turned her Brain! Where
are they? pursued he, going into her Chamber:
I'll burn all I can lay my Hands upon.

Arabella, trembling for the Fate of her Books,
followed her Father into the Room; who seeing
the Books which had caused this woful Adventure
lying upon the Table, he ordered one
of her Women to carry them into his Apartment,
vowing he would commit them all to the
Flames.

Arabella not daring, in the Fury he was into
interpose, he went out of the Room, leaving
her to bewail the Fate of so many illustrious
Heroes and Heroines, who, by an Effect of a
more cruel Tyranny than any they had ever experienced
before, were going to be cast into the
merciless Flames; which would, doubtless, pay
very little Regard to the divine Beauties of the
admirable Clelia, or the heroic Valour of the

E 4 brave

brave Orontes; and the rest of those great
Princes and Princesses, whose Actions Arabia
proposed for the Model of hers.

Fortune, however, which never wholly forsook
these illustrious Personages, rescued then
from so unworthy a Fate, and brought Mr.
Glanville into the Marquis's Chamber just as he
was giving Orders to have them destroyed.

s 81 J
THE
Female QUIXOTE.

In which the Adventure of the Books is

HE Marquis, as soon as he saw
Mr. Glanville, told him he was
T 9 resolved to cure Arabella of her

Whims, by burning the Books
that had put them into her Head:
I have seized upon some of them, pursued he,
smiling; and you may, if you please, wreak
your Spite upon there Authors of your Disgrace,
by burning them yourself.

E $ Though

Though I have all the Reason in the World
to be enraged with that Incendiary Stanza, said
Glanville laughing, for the. Mischief the has
done me; yet I cannot consent to put such an
Affront upon my Cousin, as to burn her favourite
Books: And now I think of it, my Lord,
pursued he, I'll endeavour to make a Merit with
Lady Bella by saving them: Therefore spare
them, at my Request, and let me carry them
to her. I shall be quite unhappy till we are
Friends again.

You may do as you will, said the Marquis;
but I think it encouraging her in her Follies to
give them to her again.

Glanville, without replying, eagerly took up
the Books, for fear the Marquis should change-his
Mind ; and, highly delighted with the Opportunity
he had got of making his Peace with
Lady Bella, ran to her Apartment, loaded with
these kind Intercessors; and, making hisWay by
Lucy, who would have opposed him, penetrated
even into the Closet of the melancholy Fair-one,
who was making bitter Reflections on the Cruelty
of her Destiny, and bewailing her Lots
with a Deluge of Tears.

As ridiculous as the Occasion of there Tears
was, yet Glanville could not behold them without
being affected: Afumingtherefore, a Countenance
as sad as he was able, he laid the Books
before her; and told her, he hoped she would:
excuse his coming into her Presence without
her Permission, since it was only to restore her
those Books, whose Loss she seemed so greatly
to lament; and added, that it was with much
Difficulty he prevailed upon the Marquis not to

burn them immediately; and his Fears, that he
might really do as he threatened, made him
snatch them up, and bring them, with so little
Ceremony, into her Closet.

Arabella, whole Countenance Brightened into
a Smile of pleasure Surprize at the Sight of her
recovered Treasure, turned her bright Eyes upon
Glanville with a Look of Complacency that went
to his Heart.

I well perceive, said Ihe, that, in exaggerating
the Merit of this little Service you have done
me, you expect I should sussex it to cancel your
pat Offences: I am not ungrateful enough to
be insensible of any Kindness that is shewn me;
and, tho' I might be excused for suspecting it
was rather Policy than Friendihip, that induced
you to seek my Satisfaction, by saving their innocent
Aims of my Father's Displeasure, nevertheless
I pardon you upon the Supposition,
that you will, for the future, avoid all Occasion
of offending me.

At these Words, she made a Sign to him to
be gone, fearing the Extravagance of his Joy
would make him throw himself at her Feet to
thank her for the infinite Favour ale had conferred
upon him; but, finding he seemed disposed
to Ray longer, she called one of her Women
into the Closet; and, by some very significant
Frowns, gave Glanville to understand his
Stay was displeasing; so that he left her, with a
very low Bow, highly pleased at her having
repealed his Banishment; and, aspired the marquis,
that nothing could have happened more
fortunate for him, than his intended Disposal ot

E 6- * his

his Daughter's Books, since it had proved the.
Means restoring him to her Favour.

Which contains a very natural Incident.
ROM this Time Mr. Glanville, tho' he
was far from coming up to Lady Bella's
Idea of a Lover, yet, by the Pains he apparently
seemed to. be at in obliging her, made every
Day some Progress in her Esteem. The Marquis
was extremely pleated at the Harmony
which subsisted between them ; thos he could
'have wished to have seen their Marriage advance
a little faster; but Glanville, who was better acquainted
with Arabella's Foible than the Marquis,
assured him, he would ruin all his Hopes,
if he pressed her to marry; and intreated him
to leave it intirely to him, to dispose her to consent
to both their Wishes.

The Marquis was satisfied with his Reasons,
and, resolving not to importune his Daughter;
upon that Subjel, any more, they lived for
some Months in a perfect Tranquillity; to which
an Illness the marquis was seized with, and
which was, from the first, thought to be dangerous
gave a sad Interruption.

Arabella's extreme Tenderness upon this occasion,
her anxious Solicitude, her pious Cares,
and never-ceasing Attendance at the Bedside of
her lick Father, were so many new Charms,

that engaged the Affection of Glanville more
strongly. As the Marquis's Indisposition increased,
so did her Care and Assiduity: She would
not allow any one to give him any thing but herself;
bore all the pettish Humours of a sick Man
with a furprifingSweetnefs and Patience; watched
whole Nights, successively, by his Bedside; and
when, at his Importunity, the contented to take
any Rest, it was only upon a Couch in his
Chamber, from whence no Intreaties could
make her remove. Mr. Glanville partook with
her in these Fatigues; and, by his Care of her
Father, and Tenderness for her, confirmed her
in the Esteem fne had entertained of him.

The Marquis, who had struggled with the Violence
of his Distemper for a Fortnight, died
on the Fifteenth Day in the Arms of Arabella,
who received his last Looks; his Eyes never removing
themselves from her Face, till they were
closed by Death. Her Spirits, which the De-fire
she had of being useful to him, had alone
supported, now failed her at once; and (he fell
upon thebes, without Sense motion, as soon
as she saw him expire.

Mr. Glanville, who was kneeling on the other
Side, and had been holding one of his Uncle's
Hands, started up in the most terrible Consternation,
and, seeing the Condition (he was in,
flew to her Relief: Her Women, while he supported
her, used all the Endeavours they could
think of to recover her ; but the continued so
long in her Swoon, that they apprehended she
was dead; and Glanville was resigning himself
tip to the most bitter Sorrow, when (he. opened
her Eyes; but it was only to close them again.

Her Paintings continued the whole Day; and
the Physicians declaring the was in great Danger,
from her extreme Weakness, The was carried
to Bed in a Condition that seemed to promise
very little Hopes of her Life.

The Care of the Marquis's Funeral devolving
upon Mr. Glanville, he sent a Messenger express
for his Father, who was appointed Guardian
to Lady Bella; the Marquis having fires asked
her if (he was willing it should be so. This
Gentleman arrived Time enough to be Witness
of that sad Ceremony, which was performed
with a Magnificence suitable to the Birth and
Fortune of the Marquis.

Lady Bella kept her Bed several Days, and
her Life was thought to be in Danger; but her,
Youth, and the Strength of her Constitution,
overcame her Disease; and, when she was so
well recovered as to be able to admit of a Visit
from her Uncle, Mr. Glanville sent for Permission
to introduce him: The afflicted Arabella
granted his Request; but, being then more indisposed
than usual, the intreated they would desert
their Visit for an Hour or two, which they
complied with; and, returning at the appointed
Time, were conducted into her Dressing-Room
by Luc', who informed them her Lady wasjuft
fallen into a Slumber.

Mr. Glanville, who had not sein her for
some Days, expected her waking with great
Impatience; and pleased himself with describing
her, with a Lover's Fondness, to his Father,
when the Sound of her Voice in the next Room
interrupted him.

C H A P. III.
Which treats of a consolatory Visit, and

other grave Matters.
/R AB EL LA, being then awaked from her
J Slumber, was indulging hey Grief by Complaints,
which her Women wert so used to hear,
that they never offered to disturb her. Merciless
Fate! said she, in the most moving Tone
imaginable, Cruel Destiny! that, not contented
with having deprived my Infancy of the soft
Cares, and tender Indulgences, of a Mother's
Fondness, has robbed me of the only Parent I
had left, and exposed me, at there early Years,
to the Grief of lofmg him, who was not only
ny Father, but my Friend, and Protector of
my Youth !

Then, pausing a Moment, the renewed her
Complaints with a deep Sigh: Dear Relics of
the best of Fathers! pursued she, Why was it
not permitted me to bathe you with my Tears ?
Why were those sacred Remains of him, from
whom I drew my Life, snatched from my Eyes,
ere they had poured their Tribute of Sorrow
over them? Ah ! pitiless Women ! said she to
her Attendants, you prevented me from performing
the laftpious Rites to my dear Father!
You, by your cruel Care, hindered me from
eating my sad Heart, by paying him the last
Duties he could receive from me ! Pardon, 0
dear and sacred Shade of my loved Father !
pardon this unwilling Neglea of thy afflicted

Child, who, to the las Moment of her wretched
Life, will bewail thy Loss !

Here she ceased speaking; and Mr. Glanville,
whom this Soliloquy had much less confounded
than his Father, was preparing to go in, and
comfort her; when the old Gentleman flopping
him with a Look of great Concern : My Niece
is certainly much worse than we apprehend,
said he: She is in a Delirium: OurPrefencc may,
perhaps, discompose her too much.

No, Sir, replied Glanville, extremely confused
at this Suspicion; my Cousin is not so bad
as you suppose: It is common enough for People
in any great Affliction to ease themselves by
Complaints.

But these, replied the Knight, are the strangers
Complaints I ever heard, and favour so much of
Phrensy, that I am persuaded her Head is not
quite right.

Glanville was going to reply, when Lucy, entering,
told them her Lady had ordered their
Admission: Upon which they followed her into
Arabella's Chamber, who was lying negligently
upon her Bed.

Her deep Mourning, and the black Hawse,
which covered Part of her fair Face, was so advantageous
to her Shape and Complexion, that
Sir Charles, who had not seen her since she grew
up, was thick with an extreme Surprize at her
Beauty, while his Son was gazing on her so
passionately, that he never thought of introducing
his Father to her, who contemplated her with
as much Admiration as his Son, though with less
passion.

Arabella, rising from her Bed, saluted her
Uncle with a Grace that wholly charmed him;
and, turning to receive Mr. Glanville, she burst
into Tears at the Remembrance of his having
assisted her in her lait Attendance upon her Father.
Alas ! Sir, said she, when we saw each
other lall, we were both engaged, in a very
melancholy Office: Had it pleated Heaven to
have spared my Father, he would, doubtless,
have been extremely sensible of your generous
Cares; nor'fhall you have any Reason to accuse
me of Ingratitude, since I Ihall always acknowlege
your Kindness as I ought.

If you think you owe me any Obligation, returned
Glanville, pay me, dearest Cousin, by
moderating your Sorrow: Indeed you sussex
yourself to fink too much under an Affliction
which is impossible to be remedied.

Alas! answered Arabella, my Grief is very
slight, compared to that of many others upon
the Death of their Relations: The Great Syfi-
gambia, who, questionless, wanted neither Fortitude
nor Courage, upon the News of her
Grand-daughter's Death, wrapt herself up, in her
Veil; and, resolving never more to behold the
Light, waited for Death in that Posture.

Generates, upon the Loss of his Wife, built
a magnificent Tomb for her; and, (hutting himself
up in it, resolved to pass away the Remainder
of his Life with her Ashes. These, indeed,
were glorious Effeas of Piety and Assertion,
and unfeigned Signs of an excessive Sorrow:
What are the few Tears I shed to such
illustrious Instances of Grief and Affection, as
these?

Glanville, finding his Cousin upon this Strain,
blushed extremely, and would have changed the
Subject; but the old Gentleman, who had neve;
heard of there two Persons she mentioned, !who
expressed their Sorrow for their Lofils in to
Range a Manner, was surprised at it; and \v;ls
resolved to know more about them.

Pray, Niece, said he, were you acquainted
with there People, who could not submit to the
Dispensation of Providence, but, as one may
say, flew in the Face of Heaven by their Ipsa -
thence ?

I am very well acquainted with their History,
resumed Arabella; and I can assure you, they
were both very admirable Persons.

Oh ! Oh ! their History! interrupted the
Knight I What, I warrant you, they are to be
found in the Fairy Tales, and those sort of Books !
Well, I never could like such Romances, not
1; for they only spoil Youth, and put strange
Notions into their Heads.

I am sorry, resumed Arabella, blushing with
Anger, that we are like to differ in Opinion
upon so important a Point.

Truly, Niece, said Sir Hates, if we never
differ in any thing else, I shall be very easy about
this slight Matter; tho' I think a young Lady
of your fine Sense (for my Son praises you to
the Skies for your Wit,) Should not be so fond
of such ridiculous Nonsense as these Story-books
are filled with.

Upon my Word, resumed Arabella, all the
Respect I owe you cannot hinder me from telling
you, that I take it extremely ill you should,
in my Presence, rail at the finest Productions in

the World: I think, we arc infinitely obliged
to three Authors, who have, in so sublime a Style,
delivered down to Posterity the heroic Aaions
of the bravest Men, and most virtuous of Women:
But for the inimitable Pen of the famous
Sidery, we had been ignorant of the Lives of
many great and illustrious Persons: The warlike
Actions of Oroondates, Princes, Juba, and
the renowned Artaban, had, haply, never been
talked of in our Age; and those fair and chaste
Ladies, who were the Objects of their pure and
constant Passions, had still been buried in Obscurity;
and neither their divine Beauties, or singular
Virtue, been the Suhjct of our Admiration
and Praise. But for the famous Scenery,
we had not known the true Cause of that Alison
of Clelia's, for which the Senate decreed her a
Statue; namely, Her casing herself, with an
unparalleled Courage, into the Tyber, a deep
and rapid River, as you must certainly know,
and swimming to the other Side. It was not, as
the RomanHiftorians falsly report, a Stratagem to
recover herself, and the other Hostages, from the
Power of Parent; it was to preserve her Honour
from Violation by the impious Sixtus,
who was in the Camp. But for Scudery, we had
still thought the inimitable Poetess Sappho to bea
loose Wanton, whose Verses breathed nothing
but unchaste and irregular Fires: On the contrary,
she was so remarkably chaste, that she
would never even content to marry; but, loving
Phaon, only with a Platonic Passion, obliged
him to restrain his Desires within the Compass
of a Brother's Affection. Numberless are the
Mistakes he has cleared up of this Kind, and

I question, if any other Historian, but himft1f,
knew that Cleopatra was really married to Judicis
Caesar; or that Cosa-io, her Son by this Marriage,
was not murdered, as was supposed, by
the Order of tAugztas, but married the fair
Queen ofEthiepia, in whose Dominions he took
Refuge. The prodigious Hats of Valour, which
he has recounted of those accomplished Prince:,
have never been equalled by the Heroes of either
the Greek or Roman Historians: How poor and
insignificant are the Actions of their Warriors
to Scudery's, where one of those admirable Heroes
would put whole Armies into Terror, and
with his single Arm oppose a Legion !

Indeed, Niece, said Sir Charles, no longer
able to forbear interrupting her, there are ail
very improbable Tales. I remember, when I
was a Boy, I was very fond of reading the history
of back the Giant killer, and Tom Tum b;
and these Stories so filled my Head, that I really
thought one of those little Heroes killed Men an
hundred Feet high; and that the ether, after a
great many surprising Exploits, was swallowed
up by a Cow.

You was very young, Sir, you say, interrupted
Arabella tartly, when those Stories gained your
Belief: However, your Judgment was certainly
younger, if you ever believed them at all; for
as credulous as you are pleased to think me, I
should never, at any Age, have been persuaded
such Things could have happened.

My Father, Madam, said Glanville, who
was strangely confused all this Time, bore Arms
in his Youth; and Soldiers, you know, never
trouble themselves much with reading.

Has my Uncle been a Soldier, said Arabella,
and does he hold in Contempt the Aaions of
the bravest Soldiers in the World ?

The Soldiers you speak of, Niece, said Sir
Charles, were indeed the bravest Soldiers in
the World; for I don't believe, they ever had
their Equals.

And yet, Sir, said Arabella, there are a great
Number such Soldiers to be found in Scudery.
Indeed, my dear Niece, interrupted Sir Charles,
they are to be found no-where else, except in
your Imagination, which, I am sorry to see, is
filled with such Whimsies.

If you mean this to affront me, Sir, resumed
Arabella, hardly able to forbear Tears, I know
how far, as my Uncle, I ought. to bear with
you : But, methinks, it is highly unkind to aggravate
my Sorrows by filch cruel Jests ; and,
since I am not in an Humour to sussex them,
don't take it ill, if I intreat you to leave me to
myself.

Mr. Glanville, who knew nothing pleased his
Cousin so much as paying an exact Obedience
to her Commands, rose up immediately; and,
bowing respectfully to her, asked his Father, If
he should attend him into the Gardens ?

The Baronet, who thought Arabella's Behaviour
bordered a good deal upon Rudeness, took
his Leave with some Signs of Displeasure upon
his Countenance; and, notwithstanding all his
Son could say in Excuse for her, he was extremely
offended.

What, said he, to Mr. Glanville, does she
fo:little underhand the Respect that is due to meas
hey Uncle, that the, so peremptorily, desired

me to leave her Room ? My Brother was to
blame to take so little Care of her Education
the is quite a Rustic!
Ah ! don't wrong your Judgment so much,
Sir, said Glanville; my Cousin has as little of
the Rustic as if she had passed all her Life in a
Court: Her fine Sense, and the nativeElegance
of her Manners give an inimitable Grace to her
Behaviour; and as much exceed the studied politeness
of other Ladies I have converted with,
as the Beauties of her Person do all I have ever
seen.

She is very handsome, I confess, returned Sir
Charles; but I cannot think so well of her Wit
as you do; for methinks she talks very oddly,
and has the Arangelt Conceits! Who, but herself,
would think it probable, that one Man
could put a whole Army to Flight; or commend
a foolish Fellow for living in a Tomb, because
his Wife was buried in it ? Fie, fie! there are
silly and extravagant Notions, and will make
her appear very ridiculous.

Mr. Glanville was so sensible of the Justness
of this Remark, that he could not help sighing;
which his Father observing, told him, That,
since she was to be his Wife, it was his Business
to produce a Reformation in her; for, added
he, notwithstanding the immense Fortune she
will bring you, I should be sorry to have a
Daughter-in-law, for whom I should blush as
often as the opens her Mouth.

I afllre you, Sir, said Mr. Glanville, I have
but very little Hopes, that I shall be so happy as
to have my Cousin for a Wife; for, tho' it was
my Uncle's Command I should make my Addresses

to her, she received me so ill, as a Lover,
that I have never dared to talk to her upon that
Subject since.

And pray, resumed Sir Charles, upon what
Terms are you at present ?

While I seem to pretend nothing to her, as a
Lover, replied Mr. Glanville, she is very obliging,
and we live in great Harmony together;
but I am persuaded, if I exceed the Bounds of
Friendship in my Professions, she will treat me
extremely ill.

But, interrupted Sir Charles, when she shall
know, that her Father has bequeathed you one
Third of his Estate, provided the don't marry
you, 'tis probable her Mind may change; and
you may depend upon it, since your Heart is so
much set upon her, that, as I am her Guardian,
I shall press her to perform the Marquis's Will.

Ah Sir, resumed Mr. Glanville, never attempt
to lay any Constraint upon my Cousin in
an Affair of this Nature: Permit me to tell you,
it would be an Abuse of the Marquis's generous
Confidence, and what I would never submit
to.

Nay, nay, said the old Gentleman, )you have
no Reason to fear any Compulsion from me
Tho' her Father has left me her Guardian, till
the is of Age, yet it is with such Restriction,
that my Niece is quite her own Miiilrc;d in that
¬∑Refpec; for tho' lie is directed to consult ne
in her Choice of an Husband, yet my Consist
is not absolutely necessary. The Marquis has
certainly had a great Opinion of his Daughter's
Prudence; and I hope, she will prove herself
worthy of it by her Conduct.

Mr. Glanville was so taken up with his Refletions
upon the State of his Affairs, that he
Invade but little Reply; and, as soon as he had
disengaged himself, retired to his Chamber, to
be at more Liberty to indulge his Meditations.
As he could not flatter himself, with having
made any Impression upon the Heart of Arabella,
he foresaw a thousand Inconveniences from the
Death of the Marquis; for, besides that he lost
a powerful Mediator with his Cousin, he feared
that, when the appeared in the World, her
Beauty and Fortune would attract a Croud of
Admirers, among whom, it was probable, she
would find some one more agreeable to her
Taste than himself. As he loved her with great
Tenderness, this Thought made him extremely
uneasy; and he would sometimes wish the Marquis
had laid a stronger Injunction upon her in
his Will to marry him; and regretted the little
Power his Father had over her: But he was too
generous, to dwell long upon these Thoughts,
and contented himself with doing all that was
honourable to obtain her, without seeking for
any Assistance from unjustifiable Methods.

CHA P. IV.
Which contains same common Occurrences,

bh' t placed in a new Light.
Arabella, in anew Days, leavings

Chamber, had so many Opportunities of
charming her Uncle by her Conversation,

which, when it did not turn upon any Incident
in her Romances, was perfectly fine, easy, and
entertaining, that he declared, he should quit
the Caffle with great Regret ; and endeavoured
to persuade her to accomrpa!,I him to Town:
But Arabella, who was deter 'ii , d to pass the
Year of her Mourning, ii il:- 1 ;:'- -
:. t file
had always lived in, abfoli.itci r*u.i: iv';
as her Curiosity was, to see L:i;,::,.

Mr. Glanville secretly rejoiced at this Resolution,
tho' he seemed desirous of making her
change it; but she was unalterable; and, therefore,
the Baronet did not think proper to presa
her any more.

Her Father's Will being read to her, file
seemed extremely pleased with the Articles in favour
of Mr. Clavicle, wishing him Joy of the
Estate that was bequeathed to him, with a nest
inchanting Sweetness.

Mr. Glanville sighed, and cast his Eyes on
the Ground, as he returned her Compliment,
with a very low Bow; and-sir Charles, observing
hisConfufion, told Arabella, that he thought
it was a very bad Omen for his Son, to with
him Joy of an Eftate,which he could not come to
the Possession of, but by a very great Misfortune.

Arabella, understanding his Meaning, blushed;
and, willing to change the Discourse, proceeded
to consult her Uncle upon the Regulation of her
House. Besides the Legacies her Father had
bequeathed to his Servants, those, who were
more immediately about his Person, she desired,
spright have their Salaries continued to them:
She made no other Alteration, than discharging
there Attendnniar retaining all the others; and

VOL. J. F sub

submitting to her Uncle the Management of her
Estates, receiving the Allowance he thought
proper to assign her, till she was of Age, of
which she wanted three Years.

Every Thing being settled, Sir Charles prepared
to return to Town. Mr. Glanville, who
desired nothing so much as to slay some time
longer with his Cousin in her Solitude, got his
Father to intreat that Favour for him of Arabella:
But she represented to her Uncle the Impropriety
of a young Gentleman's slaying with
her, in her House, now her Father was dead,
in. a manner so genteel and convincing, that
Sir Charles could press it no further; and all
that Mr. Glanville could obtain, was, a Perils
sion to visit her rome time after, provided he
could prevail upon his Sister, Miss Charlotte
Glanville, to accompany him.

The Day of their Departure being come, Sir
Charles took his Leave of his charming Niece,
with many Expressions of Seem and Affection;
and Mr. Glanville appeared so concerned, that
Arabella could not help observing it; and bade
him adieu with great Sweetness.

When they were gone, the sound her Time
hung heavy upon her Hands; her Father was
continually in her Thoughts, and made her extremely
melancholy: She recollected the many
agreeable Conversations she had had with Glanville;
and willed it had been confident with
Decency to have detained him. Her Books
being the only Amusement she had left, The applied
herself to reading with more Eagerness
than ever; but, notwithstanding the Delight
the took in this Employment, she had so many
Fours of Solitude and Melancholy to indulge

the Remembrance of her Father in, that she
was very far from being happy.

As she wished for nothing more passionately
than an agreeable Companion of her own Sex
aid Rank, an Accident threw a Perfun in her
WVay, who, for some Days, afforded her a little
Amusement. Stepping oneDay out ofhcrCoach,
to go into Church, fie saw a young Lady enter,
accompanied with z middle-aged Woman, who
teemed to be an Attendant. As Arabella had
never seen any one, above the Rank of a Gentleman
Farmer's Daughter, in this Church, her
Attention was immediately engaged by the Appearance
of this Stranger, who was very magnificently
dressed: Tho' she did not seem to be
more than eighteen Years of Age, her Stature
was above the ordinary Size of Women; and,
being rather too plump to be delicate, her mien
was so majestic, and such an.Air of Grandeur
was diffused over her whole Person, joined to
the Charms of a very lovely Face, that Arabella
could hardly help thinking she saw the beautiful
Candace before her, who, by Scudery's Description,
very much resembled this Fair one.

Arabella, having heedfully observed overlooks,
thought she saw a great Appearance of Melancholy
in her Eyes, which filled her with a generous
Concern for the Misfortunes of i√≥f admirable
a Person; but, the Service beginning, she
was not at Liberty to indulge her Reflections
upon this Occasion, as she never suffered any
Thoughts, but those of Religion, to intrude
upon her Mind, during these pious Rites.

As the was going out of Church she observed
the young Lady, attended only with the Woman
who came with her, preparing to walk

2 hne,

home, and therefore stept forward, and, sati-ting
her with a Grace peculiar to herself, intreated
her to come into her Coach, and give
her the Pleasure of setting her down at her own
House: So obliging al Offer from a Person of
Arabella's Rank could not fail of being received
with great Respect by the young Lady, who was
not ignorant of all the Forms of Good-breeding;
and, accepting her Invitation, she stepped into
the Coach; Arabella obliging her Woman to
come in also, for whom, as she had that Day only
Lucy along with her, there was Room enough.

As they were going home, Arabella, who
longed to be better acquainted, intreated the
fair Stranger, as (he called her, to go to the castle,
and spend the Day with her; and she consenting,
they passed by the House where the
lodged, and alighted at the Cafle, where Arabella
welcomed her, with the most obliging Expressions
of Civility and Respect. The young
Lady, tho' perfectly versed in the Modes of
Town-Breeding, and nothing-meaning Ceremony,
was at a Loss how to make proper Returns
to the civilities of Arabella: The nativeElegance
and Simplicity of her Manners were accompanied
with so much real Benevolence of Heart,
such insinuating Tenderness, and Graces so irresistible,
that she was quite oppressed with
them; and, having spent most of her Time between
her Toilet and Quadrille, was so little
qualified for partaking a Conversation Ib refined
as Arabella's, that her.Difcourfe appeared quite
tedious to her, since it was neither upon fashions,
Assemblies, Cards, or Scandal.

Her Silence, and that Absence of Mind, which
Lie betrayed, made Arabella conclude, the was

under lome very great Affliction; and, to amuse
her after Dinner, led her into the Gardens, supposing
a Person, whose Uneasiness, as the did
not doubt, proceeded from Love, would be
pleated with the Sight of Groves and Streams,
and be tempted to disclose her Misfortunes,
while they wandered in that agreeable Privacy.
In this, however, she was deceived; for, tho' the
young Lady sighed several times, yet, when she
did speak, it was only of indifferent Things, and
not at all in the manner of an afflicted Heroine.

After observing upon a thousand Trifles, the
told Arabella at last, to whom the was desirous
of making known her Alliance to Quality, that
there Gardens were extremely like those of her
Father-in-law, the Duke of - stat

this Intimation, he expected Arabella
would be extremely surprised; but that Lady,
Whose Thoughts were always familiarized to Objects
of Grandeur, and would not have been
astonished, if she had understood her Guest was
the Daughter of aKing, appeared so little moved,
that the Lady was piqued by her Indifference;
and, after a few Moment's Silence, began to
mention going away.

Arabella, who was desirous of retaining her a
few Days, intreated her so obligingly to favour
her with her Company, for some time, in her
Solitude, that the other could not refuse ; and,
dispatching her Woman to the House where she
lodged, to inform them of her Stay at the Cafe,
would have dispensed with her coming again to
attend her, had not Arabella insisted upon the
contrary.

The Reserve, which the Daughter-in-law
of the Duke of Hill continued to maintain,

F 3 not-notwithstanding

the repeated Expressions of
Friendship arabella used to her, increased her
Curiosity to know her Adventures, which fie
was extremely surprised, she had never offered
to relate; but, attributing her Silence, upon this
Head, to her Modesty, file was resolved, as was
the Cotton in those Cases, to oblige her Woman,
who, flie presumed, was her Confidante,
to relate, her Lady's History to her; and sending
for this Person one Day, when (he was
alone, to attend her in her Closet, she gave
Orders to her Women, if the fair Stranger came
to inquire for her, to say the was then busy, but
would wait on her as soon as possible.

After this Caution, (he ordered Mrs. Morris
to be admitted; and, obliging her to sit down,
told her, she sent for her in order to hear from
her the History of her Lady's Life, which the
was extremely desirous of knowing.

Mrs. Morris, who was a Person of Sense,
and had seen the World, was extremely surprised
at this Request of Arabella, which was quite
contrary to the Laws of Good-breeding; and,
as she thought, betrayed a great deal of impertinent
Curiosity: She could not tell how to account
for the free Manner in which she desired her to
give up her Lady's Secrets, which, indeed, were
not of a Nature to be told; and appeared so
much confused, that Arabella took Notice of it;
and, supposing it was her Bashfulness which
caused her Embarrassment, she endeavoured to
re-afire her by the most affable Behaviour imaginable.


Mrs. Morris, who was not capable of much
Fidelity for her Lady, being but lately taken

into her Service, and not extremely fond of her,
thought file had now a fine Opportunity of recommending
hermit to Atralzlti, by telling her
all she knew of Miss Groves, for that was he;
Name ; and, therefore, told her, since the was
pleased to command it, she would give her what
Account she was able of her Lady; but intreated
her to be secret, because it was of great
Consequence to her, that her Affairs should not
be known.

I always imagined, said Arabella, that your
beautiful Mistress had some particular Reason
for not making herself known, and for coming
in this private Manner into this Part cf the
Country : You may allure yourself therefore,
that I will protect her as far as I am able, and
offer her all the Assistance in my Power to give
her: Therefore you may acquaint me with her
Adventures, without being apprehensive of a
Discovery that would be prejudicial to her.

Mrs. Allow-is, who had been much better
pleased with the Assurances of a Reward for the
Intelligence the was going to give her, looked
a little foolish at these fine Promises, in which she
had no Share; and Arabella, supposing (he was
endeavouring to recollect all the Passages of her
Lady's Life, told her, She need not give herself
the Trouble to acquaint her with any thing that
passed during the Infancy of her Lady, but proceed
to acquaint her with Matters of greater Importance:
And since, said she, you have, n:o
doubt, been most favoured with her Confidence,
you will do me a Pleasure to describe to me, exactly,
all the Thoughts of her Soul, as the has
communicated them to you, that I may the
better comprehend her History.

CHAP. V.
Tee History of Miss Groves, interspersed

HOUGH, Madam, said Mrs. Morris,
I have not been long in Miss Groves's Service,
yet I know a great many Things by the
means of her former Woman, who told them
to me, tho' my Lady thinks I am ignorant of
them; and I know that this is her second Trip
into the Country.

Pray, interrupted Arabella, do me the Fa-our
to relate Things methodically: Of what
Ile is it to me to know that this is your Lady's
second Trip, as you call it, into the Country,
ifs know not the Occasion of it ? Therefore begin
with informing me, who were the Parents
of this admirable young Person.

Her Father, Madam, said Mrs. Morris, was
a Merchant; and, at his Death, left her a large
Fortune, and so considerable a Jointure to his
Wife, that the Duke of , being then a Wi-lower,
was tempted to make his Addresses to
her. Mrs. Groves was one of the proudest Women
in the World; and this Offer flattering
her Ambition more than ever she had Reason to
expect, :'ihe married the Duke after a very short
Courtship; and carried Miss Groves down with
her to , where the Duke had a fine Seat,
nd where she was received by his Grace's
Daughters, who were much about her own Age,
with-greatCivility. . Miss Groves, Madam, was
then about twelve Years old, and was educated

with the Duke's Daughters, who, in a little
time, became quite disgusted with their new
Sister; for Miss Groves, who inherited her Mother's
Pride, tho' not her Understanding, in all
things affected an Equality with thole young
Ladies, who, conscious of the Superiority of
their Birth, could but ill bear with her Insolence
and Presumption. As they grew older, the Difference
of their Inclinations caused perpetual
Quarrels amongst them; for his Grace's Daughters
were serious, reserved, and pious. Miss
Groves affected noisy Mirth, was a great Romp,
and delighted in masculine Exercises.

The Duchess was often reflected on for suffering
her Daughter, without any other Company
than two or three Servants, to spend great
Part of the Day in riding about the Country,
leaping over Hedges and Ditches, exposing her
fair Face to the Injuries of the Sun and Wind;
and, by those coarse Exercises, contracting a
masculine and robust Air not becoming her Sex,
and tenderness: Yet the could not be prevailed
upon to restrain her from this Diversion, till it
was reported, lie had listened to the Addresses
of a young Sportsman, who used to mix in her
Train, when she went upon those Rambles, and
procured frequent Opportunities of converting
with her.

There is a great Difference, interrupted Arabella,
in suffering Addresses, and being betrayed
into an involuntary Hearing of them, and this
last, I conceive to have been the Case of your
Lady; for it is not very probable, the would
so far forget what Ihe owed to ho own Glory,

TF S as

as to be induced to listen quietly to Discourses
like those you mention.

However, Madam, resumed Mrs. norris,
the Duchess thought it necessary to keep her
more at home; but, even here, she was not
without meeting Adventures, and found a Lover
in the Person who taught her to write.

That, indeed, was a very notable Adventure,
said Arabella; but it is not strange, that Lowe
should produce such Metamorphoses: 'Tis not
very long ago, that I heard of a Man of Quality,
who disguised himself in a poor Habit, and
worked in the Gardens of a certain Nobleman,
whose Daughter he was enamoured with: 'These
things 'happen every Day.
The Person I speak of, Madam, said Mrs.
Morris, was never discovered to be any thing
better than a Writing-master; and yet, for all
that, Miss was smitten with his fine Person, and
was taking Measures to run away with him,
when the Intrigue was discovered, the Lover
dismissed, and the young Lady, whose faulty
Condut had drawn upon her her Mother's Dislike,
was sent up to London, and allowed to be
her own Mistress at Sixteen; to which unpardonable
Neglect of her Mother she owes the
Misfortunes that-have since befallen her.

Whatever may be the common Opinion of
this Matter, interrupted Arabella again, I am
persuaded the Writing-master, as you call him,
was some Person of Quality, who made use of
that device to get Access to his beautiful Mistress.
Love is ingenious in Artifices: Who would
have though, that, under-theme o.fdciplut,
&ftinple Attendant o the fair drtemnifa Princess

of Armenia, the gallant alexander Son of the great
and unfortunate Antony, by Queen Cleopatra,
was concealed, who took upon himself that
mean Condition for the sake of seeing his adored
Princess? Yet the Contrivance of Orontes, Prince
of the Magkageies, was far more ingenious, and
even dangerous; for this valiant and young
Prince, happening to see the Picture of the beautiful
Th7aleJfris, Daughter of the Queen of the
Amazons, he fell passionately in Love with her;
and, knowing that the Entrance into that Country
was forbid to Men, he dressed himself in
Womens Apparel; and, finding means to be
introduced to the Queen, and her fair Daughter,
whose Amity he gained by rome very singular
Services in the Wars, he lived several Years undiscovered
in their Court: I see, therefore, no
Reason to the contrary, but that this Writing-masser
might have been some illustrious Person,
whom ,ove had disguised; and, I am persuaded,
added she, smiling, that I hall hear more of him
anon, in a very different Character.

Indeed, Madam, said Mrs. Morris, whom
this Speech of Arabella had extremely surprised,
I never heard any thing more about him, thar
what I have related; and, for what I know, he
continues still to teach Writing; for I don't suppose
the Duchess's Displeasure could affect
him.

How is it possible, said Arabella, that you
can suppose such an Offence to Probability ? In
my Opinion, 'tis much more likely, that this
unfortunate Lover is dead thro' Despair; or,
'perhaps, wandering over the Wold in Search

F6 , of

of that Fair one, who was snatched from his
Hopes.

If it was his Design to seek for her, Madam,
resumed Mrs. Morris, he need not have gone
far, since she was only sent to London, whither
he might easily have followed her.

There is no accounting for these Things, said
.Arabella: Perhaps he has been imposed upon, and
made to believe, that it was she herself that banished
him from her pre fence: 'Tis probable too,
that he was jealous, and thought she preferred
lomeoneofhisRivalstohim. Jealousy inseparable
from trueLove; and theflighteftMatters imaginable
will occasion it: And, what is till more
wonderful, this Passion creates the greatest Disorders
in the most sensible and delicate Hearts.
Never was there a more refined and faithful
Passion, than that of the renowned Attainments for
Mandana; and yet this Prince was driven aloft
to Distraction by a Smile, which, he fansied,
he saw in the Face of his Divine Mistress,
at a time when Ihe had some Reason to believe
he was dead; and he was so transported with
Grief and Rage, that, tho' he was a Prisoner in
his Enemy's Camp, where the Knowlege ofhis
Quality would have procured uncertain Death,
yet he determined to hazard all Things for the
sake of presenting himself before Mandana, and
upbraiding her with her Infidelity when, in
Reality, nothing was farther from the Thoughts
of that fair and virtuous Princess, than slightness
he accused her of: So that, as I said before,
it is not at all to be wondered at, if this disguised
Lover of your Lady was driven to Despair by
Suspicions as grounded, perhaps as those of

Armaments, yet not the less cruel and tormenting.


Mrs. Morris, finding Arabella held her Peace
at these Words, went on with her History in
this manner: - Miss Groves, Madam, being
directed by her Woman in all things, took up
her Lodgings in her Father's House, who was a
broken Tradesman, and obliged to keep himself
concealed for fear of his Creditors: Here she
formed her Equipage, which confined of a.
Chair, one Footman, a Cook, and her Woman:
As she was indulged with the Command
of what Money she pleated, her Extravagance
was boundless: She lavished away large Sums
at Gaming, which was her favourite Diversion;
kept such a Number of different Animals for
Favourites, that their Maintenance amounted
to a considerable Sum every Year: Her Woman's
whole Family were supported at her Expence;
and, as she frequented all public Places,
and surpassed Ladies of the first Quality in Finery,
her Dress alone consumed great Part of her
Income. I need not tell you, Madam, that my
Lady was a celebrated Beauty: You have yourself
been pleased to say, that the is very handsome.
When she first appeared at Court, her
Beauty, and the uncommon Dignity of her Person,
at such early Years, made her the Object
of general Admiration. The King was particularly
struck with her; and declared to those about
him, that Miss Groves was the finest Woman
at Court. The Ladies, however, found means
.to,explain away all that was flattering in this
Divination: They said, Miss Groves was clumsy;
audit was her Resemblance to the unwieldy German

Ladies that made her so much admired by
his Majesty. Her Pride, and the Quality Airs
she assessed, were the Subjec of great Ridicule
to those that envied her Charms: Some Censures
were maliciously cast on her Birth; for,
as she was always styled the Duchess of - 's
Daughter, a Custom flie introduced herself, she
seemed to disclaim all Title to a legal Father.
Miss Groves, as universally admired as she was,
yet made but very few particular Conquests.
Her Fortune was known to be very considerable,
and her Mother's Jointure was to descend to her
after her Death: Yet there was no Gentleman,
who would venture upon a Wife ofMifs Groves's
Taste for Expence, as very few Estates, to which
she could pretend, would support her Extravagance.
- The Honourable Mr. L-, Brother
to the Earl of, was the only one, amidst
a Croud of Admirers, who made any particular
Address to her. This Gentleman was tolerably
handsome, and had the Art of makinghim-
disagreeable to the Ladies, by a certain Air of
Softness and Tenderness, which never failed to
make some Impression upon those he desired to
deceive.

Miss Groves was ravished with her Conquest,
and boasted of it so openly, that People, who
were acquainted with this Gentleman's Character,
foreseeing her Fate, could not help pitying
her.

A very few Months Courtship completed
the Ruin of poor Miss Groves: She fell a Sacrifice
to Oaths which hid been often prostituted
for the same inhuman Purposes; and became
so fond of her Betrayer, that it wa with great

Difficulty he could persuade her not to give him,
even in public, the mois ridiculous Proofs of
her 7Tndcrmjs. Her Woman pretends, that she
was ignorant of this Intrigue, till Miss Groves
growing big with Child, it could no longer be
concealed; it was at length agreed, file should
lie-in at her own Lodgings, to prevent any suspicions
from her retreating into the Country
but that Scheme was over-ruled by her Woman's
Mother, who advised her to conceal herself
some Village, not far from Town, till
the Affair was over.

Miss Groves approved f this second Proposal,
but took Advantage of her Shape, which, being
far from delicate, would not easily discover any
growing Bigness, to slay in Town as long as
the possibly could. When her Removal was
necessary, the went to the Lodgings provided for
her, a few Miles durant from London: And,
notwithstanding the Excuses which were framed
for this flodden Absence, the true Cause was
more than suspected by some busy People, who
industriously inquired into her Affairs.

Mr. L- saw her but seldom during her illness
: The Fear of being discovered was his Pretence:
But her Friends easily saw through this
Disguise, and were persuaded Miss Groves was
waning in his Affections.

As the had a very firing Constitution, she returned
to Town at the End of three Weeks:
The Child was dead, and she looked handsomer
than ever. Mr. L- continued his visits;
and the Town to make Remarks of
them. All this time the Duchess never troubled
herself about the Conduct of this unfortunate

young Creature: And the People the was
with had not the Goodness to give her any Hint
of her Misconduct, and the Waite of her Fortune:
On the contrary, they almost turned her
Head with their Flatteries, preyed upon her
Fortune, and winked at her Irregularities.

She was now a second time with Child: Her
Character was pretty severely handled by her
Enemies: Mr. L- began openly to flight her:
And (he was now several thousand Pounds in
Debt. The Mother and Sisters of her Woman,
in whose House fie still was, were base enough
to whisper the Fault she had been guilty of to
all their Acquaintances. Her Story became generally
known: She was shunned and neglected
by every body j and even Mr. L-, who had
been the Cause of her Ruin, intirely abandoned
her, and boasted openly of the Favours he had
received from her.

Miss Groves protested to her Friends, That
he had promised her Marriage; but Mr. L-
constantly denied it, and never scrupled to say,
when he was questioned about it, That he found
Miss Groves too easy a Conquer to make any
Perjury necessary. Her Tenderness, however,
for this base Man, was so great, that she never
could bear to hear him railed at in her Presence;
but would quarrel with the only Friends the had
lest, if they said any thing to his Disadvantage.
As she was now pretty far advanced with Child,'
she would have retired into the Country; but
the bad Condition of her Affairs made her Removal
impossible: In this Extremity she had
Recourse to her Uncle, a rich Merchant in the
City, who, having taken all the necessary Precautions

for his own Security, paid Miss Groves's
Debts, carrying on, in her Name, a Law-suit
v; th the Duchy!, for ibmc Lands, which were
t> be put into her Hand,, when ic was of Age,
slid which that great Lady, detained. Miss
Groves, being reduced to live upon something
lss than an Hundred a Year, quitted London,
;sad came into this Part ;f the Country, where
the was received by Mrs. Earnest, one of her
Woman's Sisters, who is married to a Country
Gentleman of some. Fortune: In her Louis file
lay-in of a Girl, which Mr. L- sent to demand,
and will not be persuaded to inform her
how, or in what manner, he has disputed of the
Child.

Her former Woman leaving her, I was received
in her Place, from whom I learnt all
these Particulars: And Miss Groves having
gained the Affections of Mr. Barnet's Brother,
her Beauty, and the large Fortune which she
has in Reversion, has induced him, notwithstanding
the Knowlege of her past unhappy Condut,
to marry her. But their Marriage is yet
a Secret, Miss Groves being apprehensive of her
Uncle's Displeasure for not consulting him in
her-Choice.

Her Husband is gone to London, with an
Intention to acquaint him with it; and, when
he returns, their Marriage will be publicly
owned.

Clinging what a judicious Reader whim

R S. Morris ending her Narration,

i ralila, who had not been able to
retiinii her Tears at some Parts of it, thanked
her for tie Trouble the had been at; and assured
her of ilhr Secrecy: Your Lady's Case,
said the, is much to be lamented; and greatly
resembles the unfortunate Cleopatra's, whom
Julius Caesar privately marrying, with a Promise
to own her for his Wife, when he should be
peaceable Master of the Roman Empire, left
that great Queen big with Child, and, never intending
to perform his Promise, suffered her to
be exposed to the Censures the World has so
freely cast upon her; and which the so little
deserved.

Mrs. Morris, seeing the favourable Light in
which Arabella viewed the Actions of her Lady,
did not think proper to say any thing to undeceive
her; but went. out of the Closet, not a
little mortified at her Disappointment: For The
saw she was likely to receive nothing for betraying
her Lady's Secrets, from Arabella: Who
seemed so little sensible of the Pleasure of Scandal,
as to be wholly ignorant of its Nature; and
not to know it when it was told her.

Miss Groves, who was just come to Lady
Bella's Chamber-door, to inquire for her, was
surprised to see her Woman come out of it;

,till who, upon meeting her, cxprelciTd cat
C:;;filulon. Miss fhi was going to ask her lime
libations concerning her Butinelb there,
came out of her Cloltt; and, seeing
hiss Grove ' in her Chamber, aikcd her Pardon
for staying so long from her.

I have been listening to your History, slid
he, with great Frankness, which your Woman
las been rciatinr,: And I ashore you I am extremely
sensible oi your Misfortunes.

Miss Groves, at these Words, blushed with
extreme Confusion; and Mrs. morris turned
pale with Astonishment and Fear. Arabella,
not sensible that she had been guilty of any Indiscretion,
proceeded to make Reflections upon
some Part of her Story; which, though they
were not at all disadvantageous to that young
Lady, fie received as so many Insults: And
asked Lady Bella, If she was not ashamed to
tamper with a Servant to betray the Secrets of
her Mistress ?

Arabella, a little surprised at so rude a Question,
answered, however, with great Sweetness;
and protested to her, that she would make no
ill Use of what she had learned of her Affairs:
For, in fine, Madam, said she, do you think I
am less fit to be trusted with your Secrets, than
the Princess of the Continues was with those of
Clclia; between whom there was no greater
Amity and Acquaintance, than with us ? And
you must certainly know, that the Secrets which
that admirable Person entrusted with Lyfimena,
were of a Nature to be more dangerous, if revealed,
than yours. The I-appiniefs of Clelia
- depended upon L:J/imcuia's 'fidelity: And the

Liberty, nay, haply), the Life. of .ronces, would
have bel ia Manner, if she had betrayed them.
'Though I do nor intend to arrogate to mnyclf
the Possession of those admirable Qualities whkh
adorned the Princess of the Leon:, a, yet I will
not yield to her, or any one clfc, in Generosity
and Fidelity: And if you will be pleased to repose
as much Confidence in me, as those illustrious
Lovers did in her, you shall he convinced I
will 'your as earnestly for your Interest, as that
air Princess did for thole of traces and Celia.

Miss Groves was so buscd in reflelillg upon
the Baseness of her Woman in exposing her,
that the heard not a Word of this fine Ha;a:ague
(at which Mrs. Mcrr;s, notwithstanding the
Cause she had for Uneasiness, could hardly help
laughing); but, flaming some of that Haughtiness
in her Looks, for which she used to be remarkable,
she told Lady Bella, that the imputed
her impertinent Curiosity to her Country Ignorance,
and ill Breeding: And she did not doubt
but she would be served in her own kind, and
meet with as bad Fortune as the had done; and,
perhaps, deserve it worse than she did: For
there are more false Men in the World besides
Mr. L - and Ihe was no handsomer than
other People.

Saying this, she flung out of the Room, her
Woman following, leaving Arabella in such
Confusion at a Behaviour of which she had
never before had an Idea, that for some Moments
she remained immoveable.

Recollecting herself, at last, and conceiving,
that Civility required she should endeavour to
appease this incensed Lady, she went down

Stairs after her; and, flopping her suit as the
was oing out of the House, intreated her to becalm,
and fuller her to vindicate herself from
the Imputation of being impertinent curious
to know her Affairs.
Miss Groves, quite transported with Shame
and Anger, refused absolutely to ita.
At least, Madam, said Arabella, slay till
my Coach can be got ready ; and don't think
of walking home, so slightly attended.

This Offer was as sullenly answered as the
other: And Arabella, finding she was determined
to venture home, with no other Guard
than her Woman, who silently followed her,
ordered two of her Footmen to attend her at
a finally Distance; and to defend her, if there
should be Occasion.

For who knows, said the to LIy', what Accident
may happen ? Some one or other of her
insolent Lovers may take this Opportunity to
carry her away; and I should never forgive
myself for being the Cause of such a Misfortune
to her.

Mrs. Morris having found it easy to reconcile
herself to her Lady, by alluring her, that
Lady Bella was acquainted with great Part of
her Story before; and that what she told her,
tended only to justify her Conduct, as she might
have'been convinced by what Lady Bella said;
they both went home with a Resolution to say
nothing of what had palled, with relation to the
Cause of the Disgust Miss Groves had received:
But only raid, in general, that Lady Bella was
the most ridiculous Creature in the'World; and

was so totally ignorant of good Breeding, tl].;
it was impossible to consent with her.

C H A P. VI.
Wrhkh treats of the Olympic Game;.

While Arablla was ruminating on
~W!/ the unaccountable Behaviour of her
rew Acquaintance, (he received a Letter from
her Uncle, informing her (for she had expressly
forbid Mr. Glanville to write to her), that
his Son and laughter intended to set out for her
Seat in a few Days.

This News was received with great Satisfaction
by A,-ablla, who hoped to find an
agreeable Companion in her Cousin; and was
not so insensible of Mr. Glanville's merit, as
not to feel time kind of Pleasure at the Thought
if seeing him again.
This Letter was soon followed, by the Arrival
of Mr. Glanville, and his Sister; who, upon
the Sight of Arabella, discovered bone Appearance
of Astonishment and Chagrin; for,
notwithstanding all her Brother had told'her of
her Accomplishments, she could not conceive
it possible for a young Lady, bred up in the
Country, to'be so perfectly elegant and genteel
as (he found her Cousin.

As Miss Charlotte had a large Share of Coquetry
in her Composition, and was fond of
Beauty iii none of her own Sex but herself, she

was {',r'r' to see Lady Bella possessed of so great
i Si;lar; and, being in Hopes her Brother had
drawn a flattering Figure of her Cousin, she
was extremely disappointed at finding the Original
so handsome.

Arabella, on the contrary, was highly pleased
with Miss Glanville; and, finding her Person
very agreeable, did not fail to commend her
Beauty: A sort of Complaisance mightily in
Use among the Heroines, who knew nut what
Envy or Emulation meant.

Miss Glanville received her Praises with
great Politeness, but could not find in her Heart
to return them: And, as soon as these compliments
were over, aMr. Glaniv-ll'e told Lady
Bella, how tedious he had found the snort absence
she had forced him to, and how great was
his Satisfaction at seeing her again.

I Ihall not dispute the Truth of your last assertion,
replied Arabella, smiling, since I verily
believe, you are mighty well satisfied at present;
but I know not how you will make it ;p-
pear, that an Absence, which you allow to be
short, has seemed so tedious to you for this is
a manifest Contradiction: However, pursued
she, preventing his Reply, you look so welland
so much at Ease, that I am apt to believe,
Absence has agreed very well with you.

And yet I assure you, Madam, said Mr. Glanville,
interrupting her, that I have suffered more
Uneasiness during this Absence, than I fear you
will permit me to tell you.

Since, replied Arabella, that Uneasiness has
neither made you thinner, nor paler, I don't
think you ought to be pitied: For, to say the

Truth, in these Sort of Matters, a Person's bare
Testimony has but little Weight.

Mr. Glanville was going to make her some
Answer; when Miss Glanville, who, while they
had been speaking, was adjusting her Dress at
the Glass, came up to them, and made the
Conversation more general.

After Dinner, they adjourned to the Gardens,
where the gay Miss Glanville, running eagerly
from one Walk to another, gave her Brother
as many Opportunities of talking to Lady Bella
as he could with: However, he flood in such
Awe of her, and dreaded so much another
Banishment, that he did not dare, otherwise
than by distant Hints, to mention his Passion;
and Arabella, well enough pleased with a Respect
that in some pleasure came up to her Expectation,
discovered no Resentment at Insinuations
flie was liberty to dissemble the Knowlege
of: And if he could not, by her Behaviour,
flatter himself with any great Hopes, yet he
found as little Reason, in Arabella's Language,
to despair.

Mils Glanville, at the End of a few Weeks,
was so tired of the magnificent Solitude she
lived in, that file heartily repented her Journey;
and insinuated to her Brother, her Inclination
to return to Town.

Mr. Glanville, knowing his Stay was regulated
by his Sister's, intreated her not to expose
him to the Mortification of leaving Arabella so
oxon; and promised her he would contrive pomp
Amusements for her, which should make her
relish the Country better than she had yet done.

/' '~ Accord-accordingly,

he proposed to Arablla to goto
the Races, which were to be held at
a few Miles from the Caffle: She would have
excited herself, upon account of her Mourning;
but Miss Glanville discovered so great an
Inclination to be present at this Diversion, that
.ralblla could no longer refuse to accompany
her.

Since, said she to Miss GInnaviee. you are
fond of public Diversions, it happens very
luckily, that these Races are to be held at the
Time youarehere: I never heard of them before,
and I presume 'tis a good many years since they
were last celebrated. Pray, Sir, purlieus she,
turning to Glanville, do not there Races, in
some Degree, resemble the Olympia; Games ? Do
the Candidates ride in Chariots ?

No, Madam, replied Glanville; the Jockeys
are mounted upon the fleetest Coursers they can
procure; and he who firft.reaches the Goal obtains
the Prize.

And who is the fair Lady that is to bestow it ?
resumed Arabella: I dare engage one of her
Lovers will enter the Lists; file will, duetbtl!s,
be in no less Anxiety than he; and the Shame
of being overcome, will hardly affect him with
more Concern, than herself; that is, provided
he be to happy as to have gained her Affections.
I cannot help thinking the fair Elijhin(la was
extremely happy in-this Particular: For fie had
the Satisfaction to see her secret Admirer Victor
in all the Exercises at the Olympic Games, and
carry away the Prize from many Princes, ard
Persons of rare Quality, who were Candidates
with him; and he had also the Glory to receive

VOL. I. G three

three Crowns in one Day, from the Hands of
his adored Princess; who, questionless, bestowed
them upon him with an infinite deal of
Joy.

What Sort of Races were those, Madam ?
said Miss Glanville; whose Reading had been
very confined.

The Olympic Games, Miss, said Arabella, so
galled from Olympia, a City near which they
were performed, in the Plains of Elis, confided
of Foot and Chariot-Races; Combats with the
Cestus; Wrestling, and other Sports. They
were inflituted in Honour of the Gods and
Heroes; and were therefore termed sacred, and
were considered as a Part of Religion.

They were a kind of School, or military Apprenticeship;
in which the Courage of the Youth
found constant Employment: And the Reason
why Victory in those Games was attended with
such extraordinary Applause, was, that their
Minds might be quickened with great and noble
Prospects, when, in this Image of War, they
arrived to a Pitch of Glory, approaching, jn
some respects, to that of the most famous Conquerors.
They thought this Sort of Triumph
one of the greatest Parts of Happiness of which
Human Nature was capable: So that when
Pagodas had seen his Sons crowned in the
Olympic Games, one of his Friends made him
this Compliment, Now, Diagram, you may die
satisfied; since you can't be a God. It would
tire you, perhaps, was I to describe all the exercises
performed there: But you may form a
general Notion of them, from what you have
doubtless read of Juris and Tournaments.

Really, said Miss Glanville, I never read
about any such Things.

No ! replied Arabella, surprised: Well, then,
I muss tell you, that they hold a middle Place,
between a Diversion and a Combat; but the
Ol)nypic Games were attended with a much
greater Pomp and Variety: And not only all
Greece, but other neighbouring Nations, were
in a manner drained, to furnish out the Appearance.


Well, for my Part, said Miss Glanville, I
never before heard of these Sort of Races; those
I have been at were quite different. I know
the Prizes and Bets are sometimes very confiderable.


And, doubtless, interrupted Arabella, there
are a great many Heroes who signalize themselves
at these Races; not for the sake of the
Prize, which would be unworthy of great Souls,
but to satisfy that burning Desire of Glory,
which spurs them on to every Occasion of gaining
it.

As for the Heroes, or Jockeys, said Ml Ti
Glanville, call them what you please, I believe
they have very little Share, either of the Profit
or Glory : For their Masters have the one, and
the Horses the other.

Their Masters! interrupted Arabella: What,
I suppose, a great many foreign Princes send their
Favourites to Combat, in their Name? I remember
to have read, that Facilitates triumphed
three times successively at the Olympic Games,
by means of one of his Domestics, who, in his
Master's Name, entered the Lists.

G 2 Mr.

Mr. Glanville, fearing his Sister would make
some absurd Answer, and thereby disoblige his
Cousin, took up the Discourse: And, turning
it upon the Grecian History, engrossed her conversation,
for two Hours, wholly to himself;
while Miss Glanville (to whom all they said was
quite unintelligible) diverted herself with humming
a Tune, and tinkling her Cousin's harpsichord;
which proved no Interruption to the
more rational Entertainment of her Brother and
Arabella.

Which concludes with an excellent moral

H E Day being come on which they designed
to be present at the Races (or, as
Arabella called them, the Games), Miss Glanville,
having spent four long Hours in dressing
herself to the greatest Advantage, in order, if
possible, to eclipse her lovely Cousin, whose
Mourning, being much deeper, was le's capable
of Ornaments, came into her Chamber; and,
finding her still in her Morning Dress, For
Heaven's sake, Lady Bella, said the, when do
you Purpose to be ready? Why it is almost
time o1 be gone, my Brother says, and here
you are not a bit dressed !

Don't be uneasy, said Arabella, smiling; and,
going to her Toilet, I shan't make you wait
long.

Miss Glanville, feating herself near the Table,
resolved to be present while her Cousin was
dressing, that she might have an Opportunity to
make some Remarks to her Disadvantage: But
she was extremely mortified, to observe the
Hail and Negligence fine m;aie her Women
use in this important Employment; and that,
notwithstanding her Indifference, nothing could
appear more Icvely and genteel.

Miss Glanville, hoc.\cvcr, pleased hc:rcf lvwkh
the Certainty of seeing her Cou.si's Drills
extremely ridiculed, for the peculiar Raison cf
her Gown: And theVcil, which, as ieco:nii:e :r
it was, would, by its Novelty, occasion great
Diversion among the Ladies, helped to com luther
for the Superiority of her Charm:; vwhic,
partial as the was to her own, she could nor help
secretly confessing.

Arabella being dressed in much less time
than her Cousin, Mr. Glanville was admit,
who led her down Stairs to her Coach-i;ich
was waiting: His Sister (secretly reigning
at the Advantage-r,;bdcia had over hein
having so respectful an Adorer) followed :
And, being placed in the Coach, they let outwith
great Appearance of Good-humour on all
Sides.

They got to - but just time enough to
see the Beginning of the firth Course: ilri,!li,
who fansied the Jockeys were Persians of gtrea.
Distinction, soon became interest; in the Fate
of one of them, wlho'e Appearance pleased her

G 3 im.oic

more than the others. Accordingly, she made
Vows for his Success, and appeared tl extremely
rejoiced at the Advantage he had gained, that
Mils Glanville maliciously told her, People
would make Remarks at the Joy she expressed,
and fansy she had a more than ordinary Interest
in that Jockey, who had first reached the Goal.

Mr. G wlavlle,
whom this impertinent Insinuation
of his Sister had filled with Confusion
and Spite, sat biting his Lips, trembling for
-the Eft'eA it would produce in Arabella: But
she, giving quite another Turn to her Cousin's
Words, I allure you, aid she, with a Smile,
I am not any further interested in the Fate of
this Person, who has hitherto been successful,
than what the Handsomeness of his Garb, and
the Superiority of his Skill, may demand, from
an unprejudiced Spectator: And, though I perceive
you imagine he is some concealed Lover
of mine, yet I don't remember to have ever
seen him: And I am confident it is not for my
lake that he entered the Lists; nor is it my
Presence which animates him.

Lord bless me, Madam ! replied Miss Glanville,
Who would ever think of such strange
things as there you talk of? No-body will pretend
to deny that you are very handsome, to be
sure; but yet, thank Heaven, the Sight of you
is not so dangerous, but that such sort of People,
as these are, may escape your Chains.

Arabella was so wholly taken up with the
Event of the Races, that she gave but very little
Heed to this sarcastic Answer of Miss Glanville;
whose Brother, taking Advantage of an Opportunity
which-bella gave him by putting her

Head quite out of the Coach, chid her very severely
for the Liberty the took with her Cousin.
,Arabella, by looking earnestly out of the Window,
had given so full a View of her fine Person
to a young Baronet, who was not many
Paces from the Coach, that, being struck with
Admiration at the Sight of so lovely a Creature,
he was going up to tome of her Attendants to
dfk who Ihe was, when he perceived Mr. Glanville,
with whom he was intimately acquainted,
in the Coach with her: Immediately he made
himself known to his Friend, being excessively
rejoiced at having cot an Opportunity of beginning
an Acquaintance with a Lady whole
Fight had so charmed him.

Mr. Glanville, who had observed the profound
Bow he made to Arabella, accompanied
with a Glance that shewed an extreme Admiration
of her, was very little pleated at this
Meeting; yet he dissembled his Thoughts well
enough in his Reception of him. But Misa
Glanville was quite overjoyed, hoping the would
now have her Turn of Gallantry and Compliment:
Therefore,accofting him in her ,
Dear Sir George, said she, you come in a
lucky Time to brighten up the Conversation:
Relations are such dull Company for one another,
'tis half a Minute since we have exchanged
a Word.

My Cousin, said Arabella smiling, has so
strange a Disposition for Mirth, thatched thinks
all her Moments are lost, in which she finds
nothing to laugh at: For my Part, I do so
earnestly long to know, to which of these Pretenders
Fortune will give the Victory, that I

G + cancan

sussex my Cares for them to receive no Interruption
from my Cousin's agreeable Gaiety.

Mr. Glanville, observing the Baronet gazed
upon Arabella earnestly while she was speaking.
those few Words, resolved to hinder him from
making any Reply, by asking him several Questions
concerning terraces, their Owners, ads
the Bets which were laid; to which Arabi,'l
added, And pray, Sir, said sie, do me the Favour
to tell me, if you know who that gallant
Man is, who has already won the first Course.

I don't know really, Madam, said Sir G:,oge,
what his Name is, extremely surprised at her
Manner of asking.

The Jockey had now gained the Goal a second
time; and Arabella' could not conceal her
Satisfaction. Questionless, said ae, he is a
very extraordinary Person; but I am afraid we
thais not have tl'e Pleasure of knowing who he
is; for if he has any Reason for keeping himself
concealed, he will evade any Inquiries alter hir,
by shipping out of the Lists while this Hurry and
Tumult lapis, as H-srtejfius did at the Olympic
Games; yet, notwithstanding all his Care, he
was discovered by being obliged to fight a single
Combat with one of the Persons whom he had
worried at those Games.

Mr. Glanville, who saw his Sister, by her
Coquetries with Sir George, had prevented
him from hearing great Part of this odd Speech,
proposed returning to the.Cafile; to which !
agreed: But, conceiving Civility obliged
her to offer the Convenience of a Lodging to a
Stranger of Sir George's Appearance, and who
was an Acquaintance of her Cousins, You must

permit me, said flee to Mr. Glanville, to intreat
your noble Friend will accompany us to
the Cafle, where he will meet with better Accommodations
than at any Inn he can find; for
I conceive, that, coming only to be a Spectator
of there Games, he is wholly unprovided with
a Lodging.

The Baronet, surprised at so uncommon a
Civility, was at a Loss what Answer to make
her at first; but, recollecting himself, he told
her that he would, if he pleased, do himself the
Honour to attend her home; but, as his Houle
was at no great Distance from - , he would
be put to no Inconveniency for a Lodging.

Miss Glanville, who was not willing to past
so soon with the Baronet, inhibited, with her
Cousin's Leave, upon his coming into the
Coach; which he accordingly did, giving his
Horse to the Care of his Servant; and they proceeded
together to the Castle; Arablla fill
continuing to talk of the Games, as she called
them, while poor Glanville, who was excessively
confuted, endeavoured to change the Discours,
not without an Apprehension, that every subject
he could think of, would afford Arabella an
Occasion of shewing her Foible; which, notwithstanding
the Pain it gave him, could not
lessen the Love he felt for her.

Sir George, whose Admiration of Lady Beta
increased the longer he saw her, was extremely
pleated with the Opportunity she had given him
of cultivating an Acquaintance with her: He
therefore lengthened out his Visit, in hopes of
being able to say some fine Things to her before
he went away; but Miss Glanville, who ftrc.v

G 5 by

by all the little Arts fie was Mistress of, to engage
his Conversation wholly to herself, put it
absolutely out of his Power; so that he was
obliged to take his Leave without having the
Satisfation of even pressing the fair Hand of
Airabella; so closely was he observed by herCou-
fin. Happy was it for him, that he was prevented
by her Vigilance from attempting a Piece
of Gallantry, which would, undoubtedly, have
procured him a Banishment from her Presence;
but, ignorant, how kind Fortune was to him in
balking his Designs, he was ungrateful enough
to go away in a mighty ill Humour with this
fickle Goddess: So little capable are poor Mortals
of knowing what is beRt for them!

Containing some curious Anecdotes.
L Lady Bella, from the Familiarity with

which Miss Glanville treated this gay Gentleman,
concluding him her Lover, and one
who was apparently well received by her, had a
strong Curiosity to know her Adventures; and
as they were walking the next Morning in the
Garden, she told her, that she thought it was
veryllrange they had hitherto observed such
other, as to banifhmutualTruft and
Confidence from their Conversation: Whence
comes it, Cousin, added she, being so young and
lovely as you are, that you, questionless, have
been engaged in many Adventures, you have

never reposed Trust enough in me to favour me
with a Recital of them ?

Engaged in many Adventures, Madam! returned
Miss Glanville, not liking the Phrase:
I believe I have been engaged in as few as your
Ladyship.

You are too obliging, returned Arabella,
who mistook what fie said for a Compliment;
for since you have more Beauty than I, and
have also had more Opportunities of making
yourself beloved, questionless you have a
greater Number of Admirers.

As for Admirers, said Miss Charlotte bridling,
I fansy I have had my Share ! Thank God, I
never found myself neglected; but, I assure
you, Madam, I have had no Adventures, as
you call them, with any of them.

No, really ! interrupted Arabella, innocently.


No, really, Madam, retorted Miss Glanville;
and I am surprised you should think so.

Indeed, my Dear, said Arabella, you are
very happy in this respect, and also very singular;
for I believe there are few young Ladies in
the World, who have any Pretensions to Beauty,
that have not given Rise to a great many
Adventures; and some of them haply very fatal.


If you knew more of theWorld, Lady Bella,
said Miss Glanville pertly, you would not be so
apt to think, that young Ladies engage themselves
in troublesome Adventures: Truly the
Ladies that are brought up in Town are not so
ready to run away with every Mi i they see.

G 6 No,

No, certainly, interrupted Arabella; they do
not give their ConTent to such Proceedings; but
for all that, they arc, doubtless, run away with
many times; for truly there are Some Men,
whose Passions are lb unbridled, that they will
have recourse to the most violent Methods to
possess themselves of the Objets they love.
Pray do you remember how oftell Indiana was
run away with ?

Not f indeed, Madam, replied Miss Glanville;
I know nothing about her; but I suppose
Ihe is a Jews, by her outlandish Name.

She was no few, said Arabella, tho' she favoured
that People very much; for the obtained
the Liberty of great Numbers of them from cyrus,
who had taken them Captives, and could
deny her nothing the asked.

Well, said Miss Glanville; and I suppose she
denied him nothing he asked; and so they were
even.

Indeed but she did tho', resumed Arabella;
for she refused to give him a glorious Scars
which she wore, tho' he begged it on his Knees.

And she was very much in the right, laid
ivlifs Glanville; for I see no Reason why a Lover
should expect a Gift of any Value from his
Mistress.

Doubtless, laid Arabella, such a Gift was
worth a Million of. Services; and, had he obtained
it, it would have been a glorious Distinction
for him: However, Manna refused it;
and, severely virtuous as you are, I am persuaded
you can't help thinking, she was a little too rigorous
in denying a favour to a Lover like
him-Se

Severely virtuous, Lady Bella! said Miss
Glanville, colouring with Anger: Pray what
do you mean by that ? Have you any Reason
to imagine, I would grant any Favour to a
Lover ?

Why, if I did, Cousin, said Arabella, would
it derogate so much from your Glory, think you,
to below a Favour upon a Lover worthy your
Esteem, and from whom you had received a
thousand Marks of a most pure and faithful passion,
and also a great Number of very singular
Services ?

I hope, Madam, said Miss Glanville, it will
never be my Fate to be so much obliged to any
Lover, as to be under a Necessity of granting
him Favours in Requital.

I vow, Cousin, interrupted Arabella, you
put me in mind of the fair and virtuous Antonio,
who was so rigid and austere, that she thought
all Expressions of Love were criminal; and was
so far from granting any Person Permission to
love her, that fie thought it a mortal Offence
to be adored even in private.

Miss Glanville, who could not imagine arabella
spoke this seriously, but that it was designed
to sneer at her great Eagerness to make
Conquests, and the Liberties she allowed herself
in, which had probably come to her Knowlege,
was so extremely vexed at the malicious Jest, as
she thought it, that, not being able to revenge
herself, she burt into Tears.

Arabella's Good-nature made her be greatly
affected at this Sight; and, asking her Pardon
for having unfeignedly occasioned her so much
Uneasiness, begged her to be composed, and

tell her in what The had offended her, that he
might be able to justify herself in her Apprehensions.


You have made no Scruple to own, Madam,
said she, that you think me capable of granting
Favours to Lovers, when, Heaven knows, I never
granted a Kiss without a great deal of Confusion.


And you had certainly much Reason for Confusion,
said drabella,,exceffively surprised at such
a Confession: I assure you I never injured you
so much in my Thoughts, as to suppose you
ever granted a Favour of so criminal a Nature.

Look you there now! said Miss Glanville,
weeping more violently than before: I knew
what all your round-about Speeches would come
to: All you have said in Vindication of granting
Favours, was only to draw me into a confession
of what I have done : How ungenerous
was that!

The Favours I spoke of, Madam, said Arabella,
were quite of another Nature, than those
it seems you have so liberally granted: Such as
giving a Scarf; a Bracelet, or some such Thing,
to a Lover, who had haply sighed whole Years
in Silence, and did not presume to declare his
Passion, till he had lost best Part of his Blood in
Defence of the Fair one he loved: It was when
you maintained, that Mandana was in the right
to refute her magnificent Scarf to the illustrious
Cyrus, that I took upon me to oppose our vividness;
and so much mistaken was Sin your
Temper, that I foolishly compared you to the
fair and wife Antonio, whole Severity was so
remarkable; but really, by what I understand

from your own Confession, your Disposition resembles
that of the inconsiderate Julia, who
would receive a Declaration of Love without
Anger from any one; and was not over-shy,
any more than yourself, of granting Favours almost
as considerable as that you have mentioned.


While Arabella was speaking, Miss Glanville,
having dried up her Tears, sat silently swelling
with Rage, not knowing whether she should
openly avow her Resentment for the injurious
Language her Cousin had used to her, by going
away immediately, or, breaking up the
Matter, appear still to be her Friend, that she
might have the more Opportunities of revenging
herself. The Impetuosity of her Temper
made her most inclined to the former; but the
Knowlege that Sir George was to Ray yet some
Months in the Country, made her unwilling to
leave a Place, where she might often see a Man
whose fine Person had made some Impression
upon her Heart; and, not enduring to leave such
a charming Conquest to Arabella, she resolved
to suppress her Resentment for the present; and
listened, without any Appearance of Discomposure,
to a fine Harangue of her Cousin upon
the Necessity of Reserve, and distant Behaviour,
to Men who presumed to declare themselves
Lovers, enforcing her Precepts with Examples
drawn from all the Romances she had ever read;
at the End of which The embraced her, and
assured her, if fie had said any thing earth, it
proceeded from her great Regard to her Glory,
of which she ardently wished to lee her as fond
as herself.

Miss Glanville constrained herself to make a
Reply that might not appear disagreeable: And
they were upon there Terms, when Mr. Glanville
came up to them, and told Lady Bella, Sir
George had sent to intreat their Company at his
House that Day: But, added he, as I presume
you will not think proper to go, on account of
your Mourning, neither my Sister nor I will accept
the Invitation.

I dare say, interrupted Miss Glanville hastily,
Lady Bella will not expect such a needless Piece
of Ceremony from us; and, if Ihe don't think
proper to go, she won't confine us.

By no means, Cousin, said Arabella, smiling;
and, being persuaded Sir George makes the Entertainment
purely for your Sake, it would not
be kind in me to deprive him of your Company.


Mr. Glanville, being pleased to find his cousin
discovered no Inclination to go, would have
persuaded his Sister not to leave Lady Bella
But Miss Glanville looked so much displeased at
his Requefi, that he was obliged to insist upon
it no more; and, both retiring to dress, Lady
Bella went up to her Apartment, and betook
herself to her Books, which supplied the Place
of all Company to her.

Miss Glanville, having taken more than ordinary
Pains in dressing herself, in order to appear
charming in the Eyes of Sir George, came
in to pay her Compliments to Lady Bella before
the went, not doubting but she would be chagrined
to see her look so well: But Lady Bella,
on the contrary, praised the Clearness of her
Complexion, and the Sparkling of her Eyes.

I question not, said she, but you will give
Fetters to more Persons than one To-day; but
remember, I charge you, added the smiling,
while you are taking away the Liberty of others,
to have a special Care of your own.

Miss Glanville, who could not think it possible,
one Woman could praise another with
all Sincerity, cast a Glance at the Glass, fearing
it was rather because she looked but indifferently,
that her Cousin was so lavish in her
Praises; and, while she was setting her features
in a Mirror which every Day represented
a Face infinitely more lovely than her own, Mr.
Glanville came in, who, after having very respectfully
taken Leave of Lady Bella, led his
Silver to the Coach.

Sir George, who was extremely mortified to
find Lady Bella not in it, handed Miss Glanville
out with an Air so reserved, that she rallied
him upon it; and gave her Brother a very
unpleasing Emotion, by telling Sir George, fie
hoped Lady Bella's not coming along with them,
would not make him bad Company.

As he was too gallant to sussex an handsome
young Lady, who spread all her Attractions for
him, to believe he regretted the Absence of another
when she was present; he coquetted with
her so much, that Mr. Glanville was in hopes
his Sister would wholly engage him from Lady
Bella.

C H A P. X.
In wh.'ch our Heroine is engaged in a very

N the mean time, that solitary Fair one was
alarmed by a Fear of a very unaccountable
Nature; for, being in the Evening in her Closet,
the Windows of which had a Prospect of the
Gardens, the saw her illustrious concealed Lover,
who went by the Name of Edward, while
he was in her Father's Service, talking with
great Emotion to her House-Steward, who
seemed earnestly to listen to some Propositions
he was making to him. Her Surprize at this
Sight was so great, that she had not Power to
observe them any longer; but, feating herself in
her Chair, The had just Spirits enough to call
Lucy to herAfliftance; who, extremely frighted
at the pale Looks of her Lady, gave her a
Smelling-bottle, and was preparing to cut her
Lace, when Arabella, preventing her, told her
in a low Voice, that she feared hie (hould be
betrayed into the Hands of an insolent Lover,
who was come to steal her away. Yes, added
she with great Emotion, I have seen this presumptuous
Man holding a Conversation with
one of my Servants; and tho' I could not possibly,
at this Defiance, hear their Discourse,
yet the Gestures they used in speaking, explained
it too well to me; and I have Reason to expect,
I shall sussex the same Violence that many
illustrious Ladies have done before me; and be

carried away by Force from my own House, as
they were.

Alas! Madam! said Lucy, terrified at this
Discourse, who is it that intends to carry your
Ladyship away ? Sure no Robbers will attempt
any Mischief at such a time as this !
Yes, Lucy, replied Arabella, with great Gravity,
the work kind of Robbers; Robbers who
do not prey upon Gold and Jewels; but,
what is infinitely more precious, Liberty and
Honour. Do you know that Person who called
himself Edward, and worked in ticfe Gardens
like a common Gardener, is now in the House,
corrupting my Servants; and, questionless, preparing
to force open my Chamber, and carry
me away ? And Heaven knows when I shall be
delivered from his Chains.

God forbid, said Lucy, sobbing, that ever
such a Lady should have such hard Hap ! What
Crime, I wonder, can you be guilty of, to deserve
to be in Chains?

My Crime, resumed Arabella, is to have attractions
which expose me to there inevitable
Misfortunes, which even the greatest Princesses
have not escaped-But, dear Lucy, can you
not think of some Methods by which I may
avoid the Evil which waits me? Who knows
but that he may, within these few Moments,
force a Passage into my Apartment? These
flight Locks can make but a poor Resistance to
the Violence he will be capable of using.

Oh dear Madam! cried Lucy, trembling,
and pressing near her, what shall we do ?

I asked your Advice, said Ihe; but I perceive
you are lets able than myself to think of anything

to save mes-Ah! Glanville, pursued she,
sighing, would to Heaven thou wert here now!

Yes, Madam, said Lucy, Mr. Glanville,
I am sure, would not sussex any one to hurt
your Ladyship.

As thou values my Friendship, said Arabella,
with great Earnestness, never acquaint him
with what hasjuft now escaped my Lips: True,
I did call upon him in this Perplexity; I did
pronounce his Name; and that, haply, with a
Sigh, which involuntarily forced its Way: And,
questionless, if he knew his good Fortune, even
amidst the Danger of losing me for ever, he
would regent some Emotions of Joy: But I
should die with Shame at having so indiscreetly
contributed to his Satisfaction: And, therefore,
again I charge you, conceal, with the utmost
Care, what I have said.

Indeed, Madam, said Lucy, I shall tell him
nothing but what your Ladyship bids me; and
I am so frighted, that I can think of nothing
but that terrible Man, that wants to carry you
away. Mercy on us ! added she, Starting, I
think I hear somebody on the Stairs !

Do not be alarmed, said Arabella, in a majestic
Tone: It is I who have most Reason to
fear: Nevertheless, I hope the Grandeur of my
Courage will not fink under this Accident.
Hark, somebody knocks at the Door of my
Antechamber-My own Virtue shall support
met-Go, Lucy, and ask who it is.

Indeed I can't, Madam, said she, clinging
to her: Pray pardon me; Indeed I am so afraid,
I cannot stir.

Weak-fouled Wench! said Arabella, How
unfit art thou for Accidents like there! Ah!
had Cylcni.a and Artesian been like thee, the
fair Terence, and the Divine Princess of Media,
had not so eagerly intreated their Ravishers to
afford them their Company in their Captivity:
But go, I order you, and ask who it is that
is at the Door of my Apartment: They
knock again: Offer at no Excuses; but do your
Duty.

Lucy, seeing her Lady was really angry, went
trembling out of the Closet; but would go no
farther than her Bedchamber, from whence she
called out to know who was at the Door.

I have some Business with your Lady, said
the House-Steward (for it was he that knocked):
Can I speak with her at present ?
Lucy, a little reassured by his Voice, made
no Answer; but, creeping softly to the Door of
the Antechamber, double-locked it; and then
cried out in a Transport, No, I will take Care
you shall not come to my Lady.
And why, pray, Mrs. Lucy? said the Steward:
What have I done, that you are so much my
Enemy ?

You are a Rogue, said Lucy, growing very
courageous, because the Door was locked between
them.

A Rogue! said he, What Reason have you
for calling me a Rogue? I assure you I will acquaint
my Lady with your Insolence. I came
to speak to her Ladyship about Edward; who
prayed me to intercede for him, that he maybe
taken again into her Service: For he says,
my Lady never believed any thing against him;

and that was my Business: But, when I see
her, I'll know whether you are allowed to abuse
me in this manner.

Arabella, by this time, was advanced as
far as the Bedchamber, longing to know what
sort of Conference Lucy was holding with her
intended Ravisher: When that faithful Confidante,
seeing her, came running to her, and
whispered her, that the house-Steward was at
the Door, and said he wanted to intercede for
Edward.

All! the Traitor! salt lralcU.a, retiring
again: Has he, then, really bargained with that
disloyal Man, to deliver up his Mifirefs ? I am
undone, Lucy, said she, unless I can find a
Way to escape out of the House. They will,
questionless, soon force the Doors of my Apartment.


Suppose, said Lucy, your Ladyship went
down the Stairs that lead from your Dressing-room
into the Garden; and you may hide yourself
in the Gardener's House till Mr. Glanville
come.

I approve, said Arabella, of one Part of your
Proposal: But I shall not trust myself in the
Gardener's House; who, questionless, is in the
Plot with the rest of my perfidious Servants,
since none of them have endeavoured to advertise
me of my Danger. If we can gain the
Gardens undiscovered, we may get out by that
Door at the Foot of the Terrace, which leads
into the Fields; for you know I always keep
the Key of that private Door: So, Lucy, let us
commend ourselves to the Direction of Providence,
and be gone immediately.

But what stall we do, Madam, said Lucy,
when we are got out ?

Why, said Arabella, you shall contra me
to your Brother's; and, probably, we may meet
with some generous Cavalier by the Way, who
will proceed us till we get thither: However, as
I have as great a Danger to fear within Doors,
as without, I will venture to make my Escape,
though I should not be so fortunate as to meet
with any Knight who will undertake to protect
me from the Danger which I may apprehend
in the Fields.

Saying this, fie gave the Key of the Door to
Lucy, whose Heart beat violently with Fear;
and, covering herself with some black Cypress,
which she wore in the Nature of a Veil, went
softly down the little Staircase to the Terrace,
followed by Lucy (who looked eagerly about her
every Step that she went) ; and, having gained
the Garden-door, hastily unlocked it, and fled,
as salt as possible, cross the Fields, in order to
procure a Sanctuary at William's House: Arabella,
begging Heaven to throw some generous
Cavalier in her Way, whose Protection file
might implore, and, taking every Tree at a
Distance for a Horse and Knight, hastened her
Steps to meet her approaching Succour; which,
as soon as she came near, miserably balked her
Expectations.

Though Jllaiam's Farm was not more than
two Miles from the Castle; yet Arabella, unused
to such a rude Way of Travelling, began
to be greatly fatigued: The Fear she was in of
being pursued by her apprehended Ravisher, had
so violent an EffeCt upon her Spirits, that she

was hardly able to prosecute her Flight; and, to
complete her misfortunes, happening to fumble
over a Stump of a Tree that lay in her Way,
she strained her Ancle; and the violent Anguish
She felt, threw her into a Swoon.

Lucy, upon whose Arm she leaned, perceiving
her fainting, screamed out aloud, not knowing
what to do with her in that Condition: She
placed her upon the Ground; and, supporting
her Head against that fatal Stump, began to rub
her Temples, weeping excessively all the time.
Her Swoon still continuing, the poor Girl was
in inconceivable Terror: Her Brother's House
was now but a little Way off; but it being impossible
for her to carry her Lady thither without
fume Help, the knew not what to resolve
upon.

At length, thinking it better to leave her fora
few Moments, to run for Assistance, than to
lit by her and see her peril for want of it, Ihe
left her, though not without extreme Agony;
and flew, with the utmost Eagerness, to her
Brother's. She was lucky enough to meet
him just coming out of his Door; and, telling
him the Condition in which she left her Lady,
he, without asking any Questions about the
Occasion of so strange an Accident, notwithstanding
mismanagement, ran with all Speed to
the Place where Lucy had left her: But, to their
Astonishment and Sorrow, The was not to be
found: They walked a long time in Search of
her; and Lucy, being almost distracted with
Fear lest Ihe had been carried away, made
Complaints that so puzzled her Brother he
knew not what to say to her: But, finding their

Search fruitless, they agreed to go home to ths:
Caiilc, supposing, with sonic Appearance of
Reason, that they might hear of her there.

Here they found nothing but Grief and Confusion.
I\Mr. Glanville and his Silver were just
returned, and had been at Lady Bclla's Apartment;
but, not finding her there, they asked
her Women where she was, who, not knowing
any thing of her Flight, concluded she wain
the Garden with Lucy. Mr. Glanville, flr-
piled at her being at that Hour in the Garden,
ran eagerly to engage her to come in, being apprehensive
fc would take Cold, by staying lt
late in the Air: But, not finding her in any of
her usual Walks, he ordered several of the
Servants to assist him in searching the whole
Garden, sending them to different Places: But
they all returned without Success; which filled
him with the utmost Consternation.

He was returning, excessively uneasy, to the
House, when he saw Lucy; who had been suit
told, in answer to her Inquiries about her Lady,
that they were gone to look for her in the
Garden; and running up to Mr. Glanville,
who hoped to hear News of Lady Bella from
her, Oh! Sir, said she, is my Lady found?

What! Lucy, said Mr. Glanville (more
alarmed than before), do not you know where
she is ? I thought you had been with her.

Oh ! dear, cried Lucy, wringing her Hands;
for certain my poor Lady was stolen away while
he was in that fainting Fit. Sir, said she to
Glanville, I know who the Person is that my
Lady said (and almost broke my Heart) would

VOL. H keep

keep her in Chains: He was in tlhc 1iul i
nL
many Hours ago.

Mr. Glanville, suspecting this was fonte new
Whim of Arabella's, would not sussex Lucy to
say any more before the Servants, who stood
gaping with Astonishment at the strange Things
Ihe uttered; but bid her follow him to ills
Apartment, and he would hear what file could
inform him concerning this Accident. He
would, if possible, have prevented his Sister
from being present at the Story; but, not being
able to form any Excuse for not suffering her to
hear every thing that related to her Cousin, they
1ll three went into his Chamber; where lie desired
Lucy to tell him what she knew about her
Lady.

You mush know, Sir, said Lucy, sobbing,
that there came a Man here to take away my
Lady: A great Man he is, though he worked
in the Gardens; for he was in Love with her:
And so he would not own who he was.

And pray, interrupted Miss Glanville,; Who
told you he was a great Man, as you say ?

My Lady told me, said Lucy: But, howsomever,
he was turned away; for the Gardener
says he catched him stealing Carp.

A very great Man, indeed, said Miss Glanville,
that would Steal Carp !

You must know, Madam, said The, that was
only a Pretence: For he went there, my Lady
says, to drown himself.

Bless me! cried Miss Glanville, laughing;
the Girl's distracted, fire. Lord! Brother,
don't listen to her nonsensical Tales; we shall
never find my Cousin by her.

Cave her to me, said Mir. Glan-vil-, whispering,:
Perhaps I may discover something by her
;)ilcourli:, that will give us some Light into this
Fair.

Nay, I'll slay, I am resolved, answered she;
fur I long to know where my Coulin is: Tho',
do you think what this Girl says is true, about
a great Man disguised in the Gardens ? Sure my
Cousin could never tell her such Stuff: But,
now I think of it, added flie, Lady 'Blldi,
when we were speaking about the Jockey,
talked something about a Lover: I now believe
it is as the Girl says. Pray let's hear her out.

Mr. Glanville was ready to die with Vexation,
at the Charmer of his Soul's being thus exposed
but there was no Help for it.

Pray, said he to Luc', tell us no more :bout
i'hi; Man: But, if you can guess where vjur
Lady is, let me know.

In;.ccd I can't, Sir, said she; for my Lady and
I both stole out of the House, for fear Edward
iL.ould break open the Doors of her Apartment;
and we were running as tuft as possible to my
Brithe;-'s House (where the said she would hide
il self till you came); but my poor dear Lady
tell down and hurt herself lo much, that the
tinted away: I tried what I could to fetch her
again; but the did not open her Eyes: Sa I ran
like Lightning to my Brother, to come and help
me to carry her to the Farm ; but, when we
came back, she was gone.

What do you say ? cried Mr. Glanville, with
a uLitrac'cd Look: Did you leave her in that
Condition in the Fields ? And was she not to
he found when you came back ?

H 2 No,

No, indeed, Sir, laid Lucy, weeping, we
could not find her, though we wandered about
a long time.

Oh Heavens ! said he, walking about the
Room in a violent Emotion, Where can she e ?
What is become of her? Dear Sister, pursued
he, order somebody to toddle my Horse; I'll
traverse the Country all Night in quest of her.

You had best inquire, Sir, said Lucy, if
Edward is in the House: He knows, may be,
where my Lady is.

Who is he? cried Glanville.
Why the great Man, Sir, said Lucy, whom
we thought to be a Gardener, who came to
carry my Lads' away; which made her get out
of the House as sars as she could.

This is the ftrangeftStory, faidMifs Glanville,
that ever I heard: Sure nobody would be so
mad to attempt such an Ation; my Cousin has
the oddest Whims !

Mr. Glanville, not able to listen any longer,
charged Lucy to say nothing of this Matter to
any one; and then ran eagerly out of the Room,
ordering two or three of the Servants to go in
Search of their Lady: He then mounted his
Horse in great Anguish of Mind, not knowing
whither to direct his Course.

CHA P. XI.
In which the Lady is wonderfully del

T to return to Arabella, whom we left
in a very melancholy Situation: Lucy
had not been gone long from her before she
opened her Eyes; and, beginning to come perfectly
to herself, was surprised to find her
Woman not near her: The Moon shining very
bright, she looked round her, and called Lucy
as loud as she was able; but not seeing her, or
hearing any Answer, her Fears became lo powerful,
that the had like to have relapsed into her
Swoon.

Alas! unfortunate Maid that I am! cried the,
weeping excessively, questionless I am betrayed
by her on whose Fidelity I relied, and who was
acquainted with my molt secret Thoughts: She
is now with my Ravisher, directing his Pursuit,
and I have no Means of escaping from his
Hands! Cruel and ungrateful Wench, thy unparalleled
Treachery grieves me no lets than all
my other Misfortunes: But why do I say, Her
Treachery is unparalleled ? Did not the wicked
Atlanta betray her Mistress into the Power of
her insolent Lover Ah ! Arabella, thou art
not tingle in thy Misery, since the divine Man-dana
was, like thyself, the Dupe of a mercenary
Servant.

Having given a Moment or two to there sad
Reflections, the rose from the Ground with an

H 3 Intention

ictcn:;;. t ;a',kcn. but he; c nlCIc v.,, l 'S
) ;iii!,
tilsit ',c could! hardly love: Hir Tear; L can

her; ain was refitting herself up to DcLifair,

hen Chaise, drive-c by a young Gent!eml;;n,
pafiid by her. Ir.i .,> , thanking Heaven for
finding this Relief, called out a loud as the
could, conjuring him to slay.

The Gentleman, hearing a Woman's Voice,
flopped immediately, and asked what she
wanted. Generous Stranger, said Arabella, advancing as
well as was the able, do not refuse yourAfllifance
to save me from a most terrible Danger: I am
pursued by a Person whom, for very urgent
Reasons, I desire to avoid. I conjure you,
therefore, in the Name of her you love best, to
protect me ; and may you be crowned with the
Enjoyment of all your Wiles, for so charitable
an Dion !

If the gentleman was surprised at headdress,
he was much more astonished at the Beauty of
her who made it: Her Stature; her Shape, her
inimitable Complexion; the Lustre of her fine
Eyes, and the thousand Charms that adorned
her whole Person, kept him a Minute silently
gazing upon her, without having the Power to
make her an Answer.

Arabella, finding he did not speak, was extremely
disappointed. Ah! Sir, said she,
What do you deliberate upon? Is it possible
you can deny so reasonable a Request, to a
Lady in my Circumstances ?

For God's sake, Madam, silt the Gentles
alighting, and approaching her, let me
know who you are, and how 1 can be of any
Service to you.

As for my Quality, said Arabella, be assured
it is not mean ; and let this Knowlcre suffice at
present: The Service I desire of you is, to convey
me to some Place where I may be in Safety
for this Night: To-morrow I will intreat you
to let some Persons, whom I shall name to you,
know where I am; to the end they may take
proper Measures to secure me from the Attempts
of an insolent Man, who has driven me from
my own House, by the Designs he was going
to execute.

The Gentleman saw there was some Mystery
in her Case, which she did not choose to explain;
and, being extremely glad at having so
beautiful a Creature in his Power, told her she
might command him in all she pleased; and,
helping her into the Chaise, drove off as fall ashe
could; Arabella suffering no Apprehensions
from being alone with a Stranger, since nothing
was more common to Heroines than fitch Adventures
; all her Fears being of Edward, whom
file fansied every Moment flie saw pursuing
them: And, being extremely anxious to be il
some Place of Safety, she urged her Protector to
drive as fast as possible; who, willing to harsher
at his own House, complied with her Request;
but was so unlucky in his Haste, as to overturn
the Chaise. Though neither Arabella nor himself
were hurt by the Fall, yet the Necessity
there was to slay some time to put the Chaise
in a Condition to carry them any farther, filled

H 4 her

her with a thousand Apprehensions, lest they
Should be overtaken.

In the mean time, the Servants of.Jr'bcZ^,,
among whom lEditard, not knowing how much
le was concerned ill her Flight, was resolves
to d(cikiuifh himself by his Zeal in fearclhin
tor her, had difpelfiid themselves about in different
Places: Chance conducted Edward to
rile very Spot where ace was: When Arabella,
perceiving him while he was two or three
Paces oft, Oh ! Sir, cried the, behold mini
Persecutor! Can you resolve to defend me
against the Violence lie comes to offer me ?

The Gentleman, looking up, and seeing a
Man in Livery approaching them, asked her, If
that was the Person the complained of; and
if he was her Servant ?

If he is my Servant, Sir, replied she, blushing,
he never had my Permission to be so : And,
indeed, no one else can boast of my having
granted them such a Liberty.

Do you know whose Servant he is, then,
Madam ? replied the Gentleman, a little surprised
at her Answer; which he could not well
understand.

You throw me into a great Embarrassment,
Sir, resumed Arabella, blushing more than before:
Questionless, he appears to be mine;
but, since, as I told you before, he never discovered
himself to me, and I never permitted
him to assume that Title, his Services, if ever I
received anyfrom him, were not at all considered
by me, as Things for which I was obliged to
him.

The Gentleman, still more amazed at answers
so little to the Purpose, was going to dc-fire
her to explain herself upon this strange As-fair;
when Edward, coming up dole to Arabella,
cried out in a Transport, Oh ! Madam !
thank God you are found.

Hold, impious Man! said Arabella, and do
not give Thanks for that which, haply, may
prove thy Punishment. If I am found, thou
wilt be no better for it: And, if thou continued
to persecute me, thou wilt probably meet with
thy Death, where thou thinnest thou hast found
thy Happiness.

The poor Fellow, who understood not a
Word of this Discourse, flared upon her like
one that had lost his Wits; when the Protector
of Arabella, approaching him, asked him, with
a stern Look, What he had to say to that
Lady, and why he presumed to follow her ?

As the Man was going to answer him, Mr.
Glanville came galloping up; and Edward, feeing
him, ran up to him, and informed him,
that he had met with Lady Bella, and a Gentleman,
who seemed to have been overturned in a
Chaise, which he was endeavouring to refit;
and that her Ladyship was offended with him
for coming up to her; and also, that the Gentleman
had used some threatening Language to
him upon that Account.

Mr. Glanville, excessively surprised at what
he heard, flopped; and, ordering a Servant who
came along with him, to run back to the
Castle, and bring a Chaise thither to carry Lady
Bella home, he asked Edward several more
Questions relating to what she and the Gentle

5 man

man had slid to him: And, notwithstanding
his Knuwlere of her ridiculous Humour, he
ould not help being alarmed by her Behaviour,
iior concluding that there was something very
mysterious in the Affair.

While he was thus conversing with Edward,
iratei/a,l who had spied him almost as soon,
was filled with Apprehension to see him hold so
quiet a Parly with her Ravisher: The more she
rcefleed upon this Accident, the more her suspicions
increased; and, persuading herself at
hast, that Mr. Glanville was privy to his
Designs, this Belief, however improbable,
wrought so powerfully upon her Imagination,
that the could not retain her Tears.
Doubtless, said she, I am betrayed, and the
perjured Glanville is no longer either my Friend
or Lover: He is this Moment concerting measures
with my Ravisher, how to deliver me into
his Power; and, like Phililafpes, is glad of an
Opportunity, by this Treachery, to be rid of a
Woman whom his Parents and hers had defined
for his Wife.

Mr. Glanville, having learned all he could
from Edward, alighted; and, giving him his
Horse to hold, came up to Arabella: And, after
expressing his Joy at meeting with her, begged
her to let him know what Accident had brought
her, unattended, from the Castle, at that time:
of Night.

If by this Question, slid the incensed Arabella,
you would persuade me you are ignorant
of the Cause of my Flight, know, your Dissimulation
will not succeed; and that, having Reason
to believe you are equally guilty with him from

whose intended Violence I fled, I shall have recourse
to the Valour of this Knight you see with
me, to defend me, as well against you, as that
Ravisher, with whom I see you leagued-Ah i
unworthy Cousin, pursued file, What dost thou
propose to thyself by so black a Treachery?
What is to be the Price of my Liberty, which
thou so freely disposes of? Has thy Friend
there, said she (pointing to Edward), a Sister,
or any Relation, for whom thou carteret, by
delivering me up to him ? But, assure thyself,
this Stratagem shall be of no Use to thee: For,
if thou art base enough to oppress my valiant
Deliverer with Numbers, and thinnest, by Violence,
to get me into thy Power, my Cries
shall arm Heaven and Earth in my Defence.
Providence may, haply, send some generous
Cavaliers to my Rescue; and, if Providence fails
me, my own Hand shall give me Freedom; for
that Moment thou offered to seize me, that
Moment shall be the last of my Life.
Whiledrabellawas speaking, the youngGentle-
man and Edward, who listened to her, eagerly,
thought her Brain was disturbed: But Mr.
Glanville was in a terrible Confusion, and silently
cursed his ill Fate, to make him in
Love with a Woman so ridiculous.

For Heaven's sake, Cousin, said he, striving
to repress some Part of his Disorder, Do not
give way to these extravagant Notions: There is
nobody intends to do you any Wrong.

What ! interrupted she, would you persuade
me, that that Impostor there, pointing to Edward,
has not a Design to carry me away;

H 6 which

which you, by supporting him, are not equally
guilty of ?

Who? I ! Madam ! cried out Edward: Sure
your Ladyship does not fuf(tcc me of such a
strange Design ! God knows I never thought of
such a Thing!

Ah! Dissembler ! interrupted isabella, do
not make use of that sacred Name to mask thy
impious Falshoods: Confess with what Intent
you came into my Father's Service disguised.

I never came disguised, Madam, returned
Edward.

No! said Arabella: What means that Dress
in which I see you, then?

'Tis the Marquis's Livery, Madam, said
Edward, which he did not order to be taken
from me when I left his Service.

And with what Purpose didst thou wear it ?
said she, Do not your Thoughts accuse you of
your Crime?

I always hoped, Madam said he.
You hoped! interrupted Arabella: frowning,
Did I ever give you Reason to hope ? I will not
deny but I had Compafion on you; but even
That you was ignorant of.

I know, Madam, you had Compassion on
me, said Edward; for your Ladyship, I always
thought, did not believe me guilty.

I was weak enough, said the, to have Compassion
on you, though I did believe you guilty.

Indeed, Madam, returned Edward, I always
hoped, as I said before (but your Ladyship
would not hear me out), that you did not believe
any malicious Reports; and therefore you
had Compassion on me.

I had no Reports of you, said Ihe, but what
mv own Observation gave me; and that was
sufficient to convince me of your Fault.

Why, Madam, said Eiarll, did your Lady
ship see me steal the Carp then, which was the
Fault unjustly laid to my Charge ?

Mr. ;glanville, as much Cause as he had for
Uneasiness, could with great Difficulty restrain
Laughter at this ludicrous Circumstance; for he
<(uefled what Crime Jrahcllai was accusing him
of: As for the young Gentleman, he could not
conceive what (he meant, and longed to hear
what would be the End of rich a strange Conference.
But poor Arabella was prodigiously
confounded at his mentioning so low an Affair;
not being able to endure that Glanville and
her Protector should know a Lover of her's
could be suspected of so base a Theft.

The Shame the conceived at it, kept her
silent for a Moment: But, recovering herself at
last, No, said she, I knew you better than to
ive any Credit to such an idle Report: Persons
of your Condition do not commit such paltry
Crimes.

Upon my Soul, Madam, said the young
Gentleman, Persons of his Condition often do
worse.

I don't deny it, Sir, said Arabella; and the
Design he meditated of carrying me away was
infinitely worse.

Really, Madam, returned the Gentleman,
if you are such a Person as I apprehend, 1
don't see how he durst make such an Attempt.


It wei r possible, Sir, said flie, that I might
be carried away, though I was of greater Qi a-
lit than I ann: Were not llmrilaina Candtlfce,
Clelia, and many other Ladies who underwent
the same Fate, of a Quality more illustrious
than mine?

Really, Madam, said he, I know none of
these Ladies.

No, Sir! said arabella; extremely mortified.
Let me intreat you, Cousin, interrupted Glanville
(who feared this Dispute would be very
tedious), to expose yourself no longer to the
Air at this time of Night: Suffer me to conduce
you home.

It concerns my Honour, said she, that this
generous Stranger mould not think I am the
only one that was ever exposed to these insolent
Attempts. You say, Sir, pursued the, that
you don't know any of these Ladies I mentioned
before: Let me ask you, then, If you are
acquainted with Parthenmli7, or Cleopatra ?' who
were both, for some Months, in the Hands of
their Ravishers.
As forPartheniffiJ, Madam, neither have I heard
of her; nor do I remember to have heard of
any more than one Cleopatra: But she was never
ravished, I am certain; for she was too willing.

How! Sir, said arabella: Was Cleopatra
ever willing to run away with her Ravisher?

Cleopatra was ashore, was Ille not, Madam?
said he.

Hold thy Peace, unworthy Man, said Arabella;
and profane not the Memory of that fair
and glorious Queen, by such injurious Language:
That Queen, I say, whose Courage was

equal to her Beauty; and her Virtue fulraflcd
vy neither. Good Heavens! \\hiat a black
Defamer have I chosen for my Piotciorl !

Mr. Glanville, rejoicing to lee Ar/laclla in a
Disposition to be offended with her new Acquaintance,
resolved to tooth her a little, in
hopes of prevailing upon her to return home.
Sir, said he to the Gentleman, who could not
conceive why the Lady should so warmly defend
Cleopatra, you were in the Wrong to cast
stich Refic&cions upon that great Queen (repeating
what he had heard his Cousin say before):
For all the World, pursued he, knows
ile was married to Julius C0trJa.

Though I commend you, said Arabella, for
taking the Part of a Lady so hafcly vilified ; yet
let not your Zeal for her Honour induce you
to say more than is true for its Justification
for thereby you weaken, instead strengthening,
what may be said in her Defence. One
Falsehood always supposes another, and renders
all you can say suspected: whereas pure, unmixed
Truth, carries Condition along with it,
and never fails to produce its desired Effect.

Suffer me, Cousin, interrupted Glanville, to
represent to you, the Inconvenience you will
certainly feel, by staying so late in the Air:
Leave the Justification of Cleopatra to some
other Opportunity; and take care of your own
Preservation.

What is it you require of me ? said Araallda.
Only, resumed Glanville, that you would he
pleased to return to the Cafile, where my Sister,
and all your Servants, are inconsolable ibr your
Absence.

But who can assure me, answered file, that
I shall not, by returning home, enter voluntarily
into my Prison ? For, to hay the Truth,
I Still more than ilfpe you abet the Dcfizrls
of this Man; since I behold you in his Party,
and ready, no doubt, to draw your Sword in
his Defence: How will you le able to clear
yourself of this Crime ? Yet I will nature to
return to my House, provided you will swear
to me, you will offer me no Violence, with
regard to your Friend there: And also I insist,
that he, from this Moment, disclaim all intentions
of persecuting me, and banish himself
from my Presence for ever. Upon this Condition
I pardon him, and will likewise pray to
Heaven to pardon him also. Speak, presumptuous
Unknown, said she to Edward, Wilt
thou accept of my Pardon upon the Terms I
offer it thee ? And wilt thoutake thyself to tome
Place where I may never behold thee again ?

Since your Ladyship, said Edward, is resolved
not to receive me into your Service, I shan't
trouble you any more: But I think it hard to
be punished for a Crime I was not guilty of.

'Tis better, said Arabella, turning from him,
that thou shouldst complain of my Rigour, than
the World tax me with Lightness and Indiscretion.
And now, Sir, said she to Glanville, I
nul trust myself to your Honour, which I confess
I do a little suspect: But, however, 'tis
possible you have repented, like the poor Prince
ThraJfySluzs, when he submitted to the Suggestions
of a wicked Friend, to carry away the
fair Alkionida, whom he afterwards restored.
Speak, Glanville, pursued she, are you desirous;,

imit.a;ilun that virtuous Prince, ur do you
hill retain your former Sentiments ?

Upon my Word, Madam, slid GLnmv,^,Z
you will make me quite mad, if you gio on il.
this manier: Pray let me see you safe home;
:rid then, if you please, you may forbid my
iktralicc into the Cafile, if you suspect mc of
tiny had Intentions towards you.

'Isis enough, said flie ;I will trust you. As
so, you, Sir, speaking to the young Gentleman,
you are so unworthy, in my Apprehensions, by
the Calumnies you have uttered against a Person
of that Sex which merits all your Admiration
and Reverence, that I hold you very unfit
to be a Protector of any of it: The-before I
dispense with your Services upon this Occasion
and think it better to trust myself to the Conduct
of a Person, who, like Tbrafjblbunls, by his Repentance,
has restored himself to my Confidence,
than to one, uho, though, indeed, he
has never betrayed me, yet seems very capable
of doing so, if he had the Power.

Saying this, she gave her Hand to Glanville,
who helped her into the Chaise that was come
from the Castle; and the Servant, who brought
it, mounting his Horse, Mr. Glanville drove
her Home, leaving the Gentleman, who, by
this time, had refitted his Chaise, in the
greatest Astonishment imaginable at her unaccountable
Behaviour.

T H E
THE
Female QuIXOTE.

Two Conversations, out of which the

?R/,BE¬£LL'A, continuing to rumi-
^ 2 , nate upon her Adventure during
R { t their little Journey, appeared so
√≥& ~- low and reserved, that Mr. G/an-
1,-,i~ , vile, tho' he ardently wished t'-
know all the Particulars of her Slight, aid
Meeting with that Gentleman, whole Company
he found her in, was obliged to! fu)pprclj
his Curiosity for the present, out of a Fear o,f
displeasing her. As soon as they alighted it t'i2

Castle, her Servants ran to receive her at the
Gates, expressing their Joy to see her again, by
a thousand confused Exclamations.

Mils Glanville, being at her Toilet when she
heard of her Arrival, ran down to welcome her,
in her Hurry forgetting, that as her Wlomlll had
been curling her Hair, she had no Cap on.

Arabella received her Compliments with a
little Coolness; for, observing that her Grief
for her Absence had not made her neglect any
of her usual Solicitude about hier Person, she
could not conceive it had been very great: Therefore,
when she had made some slight Answer
to the hundred Questions she asked in a Breath,
file went up to her Apartment; and, calling
Lucy, who was crying with Joy for her Return,
flie questioned her strictly concerning her
leaving her in the Fields, acknowleging to
her, that she suffered her Fidelity, tho' she
wished, at the same time, the might be able to
clear herself.

Lucy, in her Justification, related, after her
punctual Way, all that had happened: By
which, Arabella was convinced she had not betrayed
her; and was also in rome Doubt, whether
Mr. Glanville was guilty of any Design
against her.

Since, said the to Lucy, thou art restored to
my good Opinion, I will, as I have always
done, unmask my Thoughts to thee. I confess
then, with Shame and Confusion, that I
cannot think of Mr. Glanville's assisting the Unknown
to carry me away, without refuting a
moR poignant Grief: Questionless, my
will surprise thee and could I conceal it

from myself, I would from thee; but, alas ! it is
certain, that I do not hate him; and I believe
1 never stall, guilty as he may be in my Apprehensions.


Hare him ! Madam, said Lucy : God forbid
you Should ever hate Mr. Glai;viil, who, I am
ire, loves your Ladyship as well as he does his
own Sister !

You are very confident, Lucy, said Arabella
bustling, to mention the XVord Love to me:
If I thought my Cousin had bribed thee to it, I
should be greatly incensed: However, tho' 1
forbid you to talk of his Passion, yet I elicit
you to tell me the Violence of his 'passports
when I was missing; the Threats he uttered
against my Ravishers; the Complaints
he made against Fortune; the Vows he offered
for my Preservation; and, in fine,
whatever Extravagances the Excels of his Sorrow
forced him to commit.

I allure you, Madam, said Lury, I did not
hear him say any of all this.

What ! interrupted Arabella: And didst thou
not observe the Tears trickle from his Eyes,
which, haply, he shrove to conceal ? Did he
not shrike his Bosom with the Vehemence of
his Grief; and cast his accusing and despairing
Eyes to Heaven, which had permitted such a
Misfortune to befal me ?

Indeed, Madam, I did not, resumed Lz ';
but he seemed to be very sorry j and said, He
would go and look for your Ladyship.

Ah ! the Traitor! interrupted Arabella in a
Rage: Fain would I have found out omne excuse
for him, and justified him in my ;

but he is unworthy of these favourable
'Thoughts: Speak of him no more, I command
you; he is guilty of assisting my Ravisher to
carry me away; and therefore merits my eternal
)Displeasure: But tho' I could find Reasons
to clear him even of that Crime, yet he is guilty
of Indifference and Insensibility for my Loss,
since he neither died with Grief at the News of
it; nor needed the interposition of his Sister, or
the Desire of delivering me, to make him live.

Arabella, when she had said this, was silent;
but could not prevent fonte Tears stealing down
her fair Face : Therefore, to conceal her Uneasiness,
or to be at more Liberty to indulge it,
she ordered Luc to make haste and undress
her; and, going To-bed, passed the finally Remainder
of the Night, not in Rest, which she
el-rv much needed, but, in Reflections on all
thePaafages of the precedingDay: And. finding,
cr imagining she found, new Reasons for condemning
Mr. Glanville, her Mind was very
far from being at Ease.

In the Morning, lying later than usual, fie
received a Message from Mr. Glanville,, inquiring
after her Health; to which the answered,
That he was too little concerned in the
preservation of it, to make it necessary to acquaint
him.

Miss Giianj'lile soon after sent to desire permission
to drink her Chocolate by her Bedside;
which as The could not in Civility refuse, she
was very much perplexed how to hide her Melancholy
from the Eyes of that discerning Lady,
who, the questioned not, would interpret it
in favour of lhr Brother.

Upon M il; G/anlvile's Appearance, she fort c,!
herself to assume a chearful Look, asking her
Pardon, for receiving her in Bed; and complaining
of bad Rest, which had occasioned her
lying late.

Mils Glanville, after answering her Compliments
with almost equal Politeness, proceeded
to ash her an hundred Questions concerning
the Cause of her Absence from the Caffle: Your
Woman, pursued she, laughing, told us a strange
Medley of Stuff about a great Man, who was a
(Gardener; and wanted to carry you away:
Sure there was nothing in it ! Was there ?

You muss excuse me, Cousin, laid ./i[izlli,
if I do not answer your Questions precisely now:
'Tis sufficient that I tell you, Certain Reasons
obliged me to a& in the Manner I did, for nv
own Preservation ; and that, another time, you
shall know my History; which will explain
many things you seem to be surprised at, at:
percent.

Your History, said Miss Glanville! Why,
will you write your own History then ?

I shall not write it, said Arabella; tho', questionless,
it will be written after my Death.

And must I wait till then for it, resumed
Miss Glanville, gaily ?

No, no, interrupted Arabella: I mean to
gratify your Curiosity sooner; but it will not be
yet a good time; and, haply, not till you have
acquainted me with yours.

Mine! said Miss Glanville: It would not be
worth your hearing; for really I have nothil,
to tell, that would make an History.

You have, questionless, returned AraJ.l:li,,
gained many Victories over Hearts; have occasioned
many Quarrels between your Servants,
ly favouring some one, more than the others:
Probably, you have caused some Bloodshed
and have not escaped being carried away once
or twice : You have alio, I suppose, undergone
some Persecution, from those who have the
Disposal of you, in Favour of a Lover whom
you have an Aversion to; and lastly, there is
haply some one among your Admirers, who
is happy enough not to be hated by you.

I assure you, interrupted Miss Glanville, I hate
none of my Admirers ; and I can't help thinking
you very unkind to ufc my Brother as you
do: I am sure, there is not one Man in an hin-died,
that would take so much from your Hands
as he does.

Then there is not one Man in an hundred,
resumed Arabella, whom I should think worthy
to serve me: But, pray, Madam, What ill
Usage is it your Brother complains of ? I have
treated him with much less Severity than he had
Reason to expect; and, notwithstanding he had
the Presumption to talk to me of Love, I have
endured him in my Sight; an Indulgence, for
which I may haply be blamed in After-ages.

Why, sure, Lady Bella, said Miss Glanville,
it would be no such Crime for my Brother to
love you !

But it was a mortal Crime to tell me so, interrupted
Arabella.

And why was it such a mortal Crime to tell
you so, said Miss Glanville ? Are you the first
Woman by Millions, that has been told so ?

Doubts, returned ArLf-'.'ia, I am the id'ir
Woman of my Quality, that ever was told so
by any Man, till after an infinite N;u:'!:e ' c
Services, and secret Sufferings: And t!ily), I
am of the illustrious Mlacmlldi's ?sind; so, Cite
said, That flie should think it an u:;ia'!donab!e
Presumption, for the greatest King onr Earth to
tell her he loved her, tho' after Ten Years of the
mot faithful Services, and concealed Torments.


Ten Years ! cried out Miss Glanville, in
Amazement; Did she consider what Alterations
ten Years would make in her Face, and
how much older she would be at the End (i
Ten Years, than she was before ?

Truly, said .arabella, it is not usual to confider
such little Matters so nicely ; one never tithe
Idea of an Heroine older than Eighteen,
tho' her History begins at that Age; a!d t!lr
Events, which compose it, contain the Space
of Twenty more.

But, dear Cousin, returned miss G/l/a /nz
do you resolve to be Ten Years a courting ? Or
rather, will you be loved in Silence Ten Yearn,
and be courted the other Ten S ;;nd so marry
when you are an old Woman ?

Pardon me, Cousin, relic ,draldlla; 1
must really find Fault with the Coolness of
your language. Courting, and Old Woman
What strange Terms ! Let us, I beseech-iu,
end thisDifpute: If you have any thing to any in
Justification of your Brother, v.hich, I filppcte,
was the chief Intention of your Visit, I stall n!
be rude enough to restrain you; tho' I could
wish you would not lay me under the Necesse

1. I sit

city of hearing what I cannot persuade myself
to believe.

Since, returned Miss Glanville, I know of
no Crime my Brother has been guilty of, I have
nothing to say in his Justification: I only know,
that he is very much mortified at the Meagre
yop sent him this Morning; for I was with him
when he received it: But pray, What has he
done to offend you ?

If Mr. Glanville, interrupted Arabella, hopes
for my Pardon, he nuit purchase it by his Repentance,
and a sincere Confession of his Fault;
which you may much better underhand from
himself, than from me: And, for this Purpose,
I will condescend to grant him a private Audience,
at which I desire you would be present;
and also, I should take it well, if you will let
him know, that he owes this Favour wholly to
your Interposition.

Miss Glanville, who knew her Brother was
extremely desirous of seeing Arabella, was glad
to accept of these strange Terms; and left her
Chamber, in order to acquaint him with that
Lady's Intentions.

A solemn Interview.
N the mean time, that Fair-one, being risen,
and negligently dressed, as was her Custom,
went into her Closet, sending to give Miss

Glanville Notice, That fie was ready to see her.
'I'his Message immediately brought both the
Brother and the Sister to her Apartment: And
Miss Glanville, at her Brother's Request, flaying
in the Chamber, where The busied herself
in looking at her Cousin's Jewels, which lay
upon the Toilet, he came alone into the Closet,
in so much Confusion at the Thoughts of
the ridiculous Figure he made in complying
with Arabella's fantastical Humours, that his
Looks persuading her, there was some great
Agitation in his Mind, the expected to see him
fall at her Feet, and endeavour to deprecate
her Wrath by a Deluge of Tears.

Mr. Glanville however disappointed her in
that respect; for, taking a Seat near her, he
began to intreat, her with a smiling Countenance,
to tell him in what he had offended her;
protesting, that he was not conscious of doing
or saying any thing to displease her.

arabella was greatly confused at this Question,
which she thought she had no Reason to expect;
it not being possible for her to tell him the was
offended, that he was not in abfoluteDefpair for
herAbfence, without, at the same time, confessing
the looked upon him in the Light of a Lover,
whose Expressions of a violent Passion would not
have displeased her: Therefore, to disengage
herself from the Perplexity his Question threw
her into, she was obliged to offer some Violence
to her Ingenuousness ; and, contrary to her real
Belief, tax him again with a Design of betraying
her into the Power of the Unknown.

Mr. Glanville, tho' excessively vexed at her
persisting in so ridiculous an Error, could hardly

help singling at the flcrn Manner in which file
fiokc; but, knowing of what fatal Consequence
it would be to him, if he indulged any Gaiety
ins l so lc-n a Conference, he composed his
Looks to a Gravity suitable to the Occasion;
.lnd asked her, in a very submissive Tone, What
Motive the was pleated to assign for so extraordinary
a Piece of Villainy, as that she supposed
him guilty of?

Truly, answered she, blushing, I do not pretend
to account for the Actions of wicked and
ungenerous Persons,
But, Madam, resumed Glanville, if I must needs
be suffered of a Design to seize upon your Person,
methinks it would have been more reasonable
to suppose, I would rather use that Violence
in Favour of my own Pretensions, than
those of any other whatever; for, tho' you have
expressly forbid me to tell you I love you, yet
I hope, you still continue to think I do.

I assure you, returned Arabella, assuming a
severe Look, I never gave myself the Trouble to
examine your Behaviour with Care enough to
be sensible,. if you still were guilty of the Weakness,
which displeased me; but, upon a Supposition,
that you repented of your Fault, I was
wailing to live with you upon Terms of Civility
and Friendship, as became Persons in that
Degree of Relationship in which we are: Therefore,
if you are wise, you will not renew the Remembrance
of those Follies I have long since
pardoned; nor seek Occasions of offending me
by new ones of the same kind, left it produce a
more severe Sentence than that I formerly laid
pont you.

However, Madam, lrtuirned Aiv. (;,',.i.;.'i/,
you must fnffir nm to afire you, 'hat ny own
Intermit, which was greatly concerned in your
Safety, and my Principles of Honour, whenever
allow me to engage in so villainous an
Enterprize, as that of abetting aly l'erfon in
stealing you away: Nur can I conceive, how
you possibly could imagine a Fellow, who wa, :
your menial Servant, could form so presumptuous
and dangerous a Design.

By your Manner of speaking, resumed ,tray
one would imagine you were really ignorant,
both of the Quality of that presumptuous
Man, as well as his designed Offence: But
yet, 'tis certain, I saw you in his Company
and saw you ready to draw your Sword in his
Defence, against my Deliverer. Glad I not the
Evidence of my own Senses, for your Guilt, I
muff confers, I could not be persuaded of it by
any other Means: Therefore, since Appearances
are certainly against you, it is not strange, if
I cannot consent to acquit you in my Apprehends,
till I have more certain Confirmation of
your Innocence, than your bare Testimony only;
which, at present, has not all the Weight with
me it had some time ago.

I protest, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, who
was strangely perplexed, I have Reason to think
my Case extremely hard, since I have brought
myself to be fufipeaed by you, only through my
Eagerness to find you, and Solicitude for your
Welfare.

Doubtless, interrupted Arabella, if you are
innocent, your Case is extremely hard; yet
it is not singular; and therefore you have

I 3 less

less Reason to complain : The valiant Coria-hastes,
who was the most passionate and faithful
Lover imaginable, having, by his admirable
Valour, assisted the Ravishers of his adored
Cleopatra against those who came to rescue her;
and, by his Arm alone, opposed to great Numbers
of their Enemies, facilitated the Execution
of their Design, had the Mortification afterwards
to know, that he had, all that time,
been fighting against that Divine Princess, who
loaded him with the most cruel Reproaches for
the Injury he had done her: Yet Fortune was
so kind, as to give him the Means of repairing
his Fault, and restoring him to some Part of
her good Opinion; for, covered with Wounds
as he was, and fatigued with fighting, before,
yet he undertook, in that Condition, to prevent
her Ravishers from carrying her off; and,
for several Hours, continued fighting alone with
near Two hundred Men, who were not able to
overcome him, notwithstanding his extreme
Weariness, and the Multitude of Blows which
they aimed athim: Therefore, Glanville, considering
you, as Cleopatra did that unfortunate
Prince, who was before suffered by her, as
neither guilty nor innocent, I can only, like her,
wish you may find some Occasion justifying
yourself, from the Crime laid to your Charge:
'fill then, I must be under necessity of banifli-
ingyou from my Presence, with the same consolatory
Speech the used to that unfortunate
Princeton therefore, Glanville, go, and
endeavour your own Justification; I desire
you should effect it, no less than you do yourself;
and, if my Prayers can obtain from

Heaven this Favour for you, I Ihall not
scruple to offer some in your behalf."

C H A P. III.
In which the Interviews is ended, not mlucki

to the Lover's Satisfaction, but exactly
conformable to the Rules of romance.
.ARABELLA, when the had pronounced
Ac these Words, bluffed excessively, thinking
she had said too much: But, not seeing
any Signs of extreme Joy in the Face of Glanville,
who was silently cursing Cleopatra, and
the Authors of those Romances, that had ruined
so noble a Mind; and exposed him to perpetual
Vexations, by the unaccountable Whims
they had raised-Why are you not gone, said
she, while I am in an Humour not to repent of
the Favour I have shewn you?

You must excuse me, Cousin, said Mr.
Glanville, peevishly, if I do not think so highly
as you do of the Favour. Pray how am 1
obliged to you for depriving me of the Pleasure
of seeing you, and sending me on a Wild-goose
Chace, after Occasions to justify myself of a
Crime I m-wholly innocent of, and would
scorn to colnit ?

Though, resumed Arabella, with great Calmness,
I have Reason to be dissatisfied with the
cool and unthankful manner in which you ret

4 clive

crit my Indulgence, yet I shall not change the
;v.iour~able Disposition I am in towards you, ,
you provoke mel to it by new Acts of Disobedience:
Therefore, in the Language of
J','patra, I stall tell you. -
Upon my Soul, Madam, interrupted Glans
I have no Patience with that rigorous
Gipsy, whose Example you follow so exactly,
to my Snow: Speak in your own Language,
I beseech you; for I am sure neither hers,
nor any one's upon Earth, can excel it.

Yet, said Arabella, striving to repress some
Inclination to smile at this Sally, notwithstanding
your unjust Prohibitions, I shall make use
of the Language of that incomparable Lady, to
tell you my Thoughts; which are, That 'tis
possible you might be sufficiently justified in my
Apprehensions, by the Anxiety it now appears
you had for my Safety, by the Probability which
I find in your Discourse, and the good Opinion
I have of you, were it not requisite to make
your Innocence apparent to the World, that soit
might be lawful for Arabella to readmit you,
with Honour, into her former Esteem and
Friendship.

Mr. Glanville, seeing it would be in vain to
attempt to make her alter her fantastical Determination
at this time, went out of the Closet
without deigning to make any Reply to his
Sentence, though delivered in the Language of
the admirable Cleopatra: But his ill Humour
was so visible in his Face, that arabella,
who
mistook it for an Excess of Despair, could not
help feeling sone kind of Pity for the Rigour
which the Laws of ITno3r and Romance

obliged her to use him with. And, while Me
sat meditating upon the Scene which had
tuft passed, Mr. Glanville returned to his own
Room, glad that his Sister, not being in Arabella's
Chamber, where head left her, had no
Opportunity of observing his Discontent, which
She would not fail to inquire the Cause of.

Here he sat, ruminating upon the Follies of
.arabella, which he found grew more glaring
every Day: Every thing furnished Matter for
some new Extravagance; her Charater was so
ridiculous, that he could propose nothing to
himself but eternal Shame and Disquiet, in the
Possession of a Woman, for whom he must
always blush, and be in Pain. But her Beauty
had made a deep Impression on his Heart: He
admired the Strength of her Understanding;
her lively Wit; the Sweetness of her Temper;
and a Thousand amiable Qualities which distinguished
her from the rest of her Sex: Her
Follies, when opposed to all those Charms of
Mind and Person, seemed inconsiderable and
weak ; and, though they were capable of given.
him great Uneasiness, yet they could not teller;
a Passion which every Sight of her bo muche
more confirmed.

As he feared it was impossible to help loving
her, his IHappinief depended upon curing her ct
her romantic Notions; and, though he knew-not
how to effet tIch a Change in her 'a. x\:a
necessary to complete it, yet he would nor despair,
but comforted linifelf with l-Iopes ol
what he had not Courage to attempt. Sometimes
he fansied Company, and an Acquaintance
wvih the world, would produce the Ali

5 vernon

iteration he wished: Yet he dreaded to see her
exposed to Ridicule by her fantastical Behaviour,
and become the Jest of Persons who were not
possessed of half her Understanding.

While he traversed his Chamber, wholly
engrossed by these Refletions, Miss Glanville
was entertaining Sir George, of whose coming
she was informed while the was in Arabella's
Chamber.

C HA P. IV.
In which our Heroine is greatly difap-

I SS Glanville, supposing her Brother
would be glad not to be interrupted in
his Conference with Lady Bella, did not allow
any one to acquaint them with Sir George's
Visit; and, telling the Baronet her Cousin was
indisposed, had, by these means, all his conversation
to herself.

Sir George, who ardently wished to see Lady
Bella, protract his Visit, in hopes that he
should have that Satisfation before he went
away. And that fair Lady, whose Thoughts
were a little discomposed by the Despair the apprehended
Mr. Glanville was in, and fearful of
the Consequences, when the had sat some time
after he left her, ruminating upon what had
happened, quitted her Closet, to go and inquire
of Miss Glanville, in what Condition his Mind

seemed to be when he went away; for (he never
doubted but that he was gone, like Coriolanus,
to seek out for some Occasion to manifest his
Innocence.

Hearing, therefore, the Voice of that Lady,
who was talking and laughing very loud in one
of the Summer-parlours, and being terrified
with the Apprehension, that it was her Brother
with whom she was thus diverting herself, lie
opened the Door of the Room precipitately;
and, by her Entrance, filled Sir George with
extreme Pleasure; while her unexpected Sight
produced a quite contrary Effect on Miss Glanville.


Arabella, eased of her Fear, that it was Mr.
Glanville, who, instead of dying with Despair,
was giving Occasion for that noisy Laugh of his
Sister, saluted the Baronet with great Civility;
and, turning to Miss Glanville, I must needs
chide you, said (he, for the Insensibility with
which it appears you have parted with your
Brother.

Bless me, Madam, interrupted Miss Glanville,
what do you mean ? Whither is my Brother
gone ?

That, indeed, I am quite ignorant of, resumed
Arabella; and I suppose he himself hardly
knows what Course he shall take: But he has
been with you, doubtless, to take his Leave.

Take his Leave! repeated Miss Glanville:
Has he left the Castle so suddenly then, and
gone away without me?

The Enterprize upon which he is gone, said
Arabella, would not admit of a Lady's Company:
And, face he has left so considerable an

1 6 toss.

I-Hotlag with me as yourself, I expel he will
not be long before he return; and, I hope, to
the Satisfaction of us both.

Miss Glanville, who could not penetrate into
the Meaning of her Cousin's Words, began to
be Strangely alarmed: But, presently, supposing
file had a mind to divert herself with her Fears,
Ihe recovered herself, and told her she would go
up to her Brother's Chamber, and look for him.

Arabella did not offer to prevent her, being
very desirous of knowing, whether he had not
left a Letter for her upon his Table, as was the
Custom in those Cases: And, while she was
gone, Sir George seized the Opportunity of saying
an hundred gallant Things to her, which
she received with great Indifference; the most
extravagant Compliments being what she expected
from all Men: And, provided they did
not directly presume to tell her they loved her,
no Sort of Flattery or Adulation could displease
her.

In the mean time, Miss Glanville, having
found her Brother in his Chamber, repeated to
him what Lady Bella had laid, as she supposed,
to fright her.

Mr. Glanville, hearing this, and that Sir
George was with her, hastened to them as fast
as possible, that he might interrupt the foolish
Stories he did not doubt file was telling.

Upon Miss Glanville's Appearance with her
Brother, Airabella was astonished.

I apprehended, Sir, said the, that you were
fine Miles from the Castle by this time: But
your Delay and Indifference convince me, you

neither expect nor wish to find the means of being
justified in my Opinion.

Pray, Cousin, interrupted Glanville (speaking
softly to her), let us leave this Dispute to some
other time.

No, Sir, resumed she, aloud, myrHonour is
concerned in your Justification: Nor is it fit I
should submit to have the Appearance of Amity
for a Person who has not yet sufficiently cleared
himself of a Crime, with too much Reason laid
to his Charge. Did Coriolanus, think you, ad
in this manner? Ah! if he had, doubtless,
Cleopatra would never have pardoned him: Nor
will I any longer sussex you to give me repeated
Causes of Discontent.

Sir George, seeing Confusion in Mr. Glanville's
Countenance, and Rage in Arabella's, began to
think, that what he had at first took for a Jest,
was a serious Quarrel between them, at which
it was not proper he should be present; and was
preparing to go: When isabella, flopping him
with a graceful AAion-

If, noble Stranger, said (he, you are so partial
to the Failings of a Friend, that you will
undertake to defend any unjustifiable Action he
may be guilty of, you are at Liberty to depart:
But, if you will promise to be an unprejudiced
Hearer of the Dispute between Mr. Glanville
and myself, you fall know the Adventure
which has given Rise to it and will be Judge
of the Reasonableness of the Commands I have
laid on him.

Though, Madam, said Sir George (bowing
very low to her), Mr. Glanville is my Friend,
yet there is no Likelihood I shall espouse his Interest

against yours: And a very strong Prepossession
I feel in Favour of you, already persuades
me, that I shall give Sentence on your
Side, since you have honoured me so far, as to
constitute me Judge of this Difference.

The solemn Manner in which Sir George
(who began to fufpea Lady Bella's peculiar
Turn) spoke this, pleased her infinitely; while
Mr. Glanville, vexed as he was, could hardly
forbear laughing: When Arabella, after a Look
of Approbation to Sir George, replied;

I find I have unwillingly engaged myself to
more than I first intended: For, to enable you
to judge clearly of the Matter in Dispute, 'tis
necessary you hould know my whole History.

Mr. Glanville, at this Word, not being able
to constrain himself, uttered a Groan, of the
same Nature with those which are often heard in
the Pit at the Representation of a new Play.
Sir George understood him perfectly well; yet
seemed surprised: And Arabella, starting up,

Since, said she, I have given you no new
Cause of Complaint, pray, from whence proceeds
this Increase of Affliction ?

1 assure you, Cousin, answered he, my As-fluxion,
if you please to term it so, increases
every Day; and I believe it will make me mad
at las: For this unaccountable Humour of
yours is no. to be borne.

You do not seem, replied Arabella, to be far
from Madness already: And if your Friend
here, upon hearing the Passages between us,
should pronounce you guilty, I shall be at a
Loss, whether I ought to treat you as a Madman,
or a Criminal. Sir, added she, turning

to Sir George, you will excuse me, if, for certain
Reasons, I can neither give you my History
myself, nor be present at.the Relation of it: One
of my Women, who is most in my Confidence,
iliall acquaint you with all the Particulars of
my Life: After which I expect Mr. Glanville
will abide by your[Decifion, as, I assure myself,
I shall be contented to do.

Saying this, she went out of the Parlour, in
order to prepare Lucy for the Recital she was to
make.

Mr. Glanville, resolving not to be present at
this new Absurdity, ran out after her; and
went into the Garden, with a wrong Inclination
to hate the lovely Visionary who gave him such
perpetual Uneasiness; leaving his Sister alone
with the Baronet, who diverted herself extremely
with the Thoughts of hearing her Cousin's
History; assuring the Baronet, that he might
something very curious in it, and find Matter
sufficient to laugh at; for she was the most
whimsical Woman in the World.

Sir George, who resolved to profit by the
Knowlege of her Foible, made very little Reply
to Miss Glanville's Sneers; but waited patiently
for the promised History, which was
much longer coming than he imagined.

CHAP. V.
Some curious Instructions for relating an

IR Bell A, as soon as the left them,
A went up to her Apartment; and, calling
Lucy into her Closet, told her that she had
made Choice of her, since she was best acquainted
with her Thoughts, to relate her
History to her Cousins, and a Person of Quality
who was with them.

Sure your Ladyflip jilts with me, said Lucy:
How can I make a History about your ladyship
?

There is no Occasion, replied Arabella, for
you to make a History: There are Accidents
enough in my Life to afford Matter for a long
one: All you have to do is to relate them as
exactly as possible. You have lived with me
from my Childhood, and are infiru√≥ced in all
my Adventures; so that you must be certainly
very capable of executing the Task I have honoured
you with.

Indeed, said Lury, I muss beg your Ladyship
will excuse me: I never could tell how to repeat
a Story when I have read it; and I know
it is not rich simple Girls as I can tell Histories:
It is only fit for Clerks, and such Sort of People,
that are very learned.

You are learned enough for thatPurpofe, said
Arabella; and, if you make so much Difficulty
in performing this Part of your Duty, pray how

came you to imagine you were fit for my Service,
and the Distinction I have favoured you
with ? Did you ever hear of any Woman that
refused to relate her Lady's Story, when desired ?
Therefore, if you hope to possess my Favour
and Confidence any longer, acquit yourself
handsomely of this Talk, to which I have preferred
you.

Lucy, terrified at the Displeasure flIe saw in
her Lady's Countenance, begged her to tell
her what she must say.

Well ! exclaimed Arabella: I am certainly
the most unfortunate Woman in the World !
Every thing happens to me in a contrary manner
from any other Person! Here, instead of my
desiring you to soften those Parts of my History
where you have greatest room to flatter; and
to conceal, if possible, some of those Disorders
my Beauty has occasioned; you ask me to tell
you what you muss say ; as if it was not necessary
you should know as well as myself, and be
able, not only to recount all my Words and.
Aaions, even the smallest and most inconsiderable,
but also all my Thoughts, however instantaneous;
relate exactly every Change of my
Countenance; number all my Smiles, Half-similes,
Blushes, Turnings pale, Glances, Pauses,
Full-flops, Interruptions; the Rise and Falling
of my Voice; every Motion of my Eyes; and
every Gesture which I have used for there Ten
Years pat; nor omit the smallest Circumstance
that relates to me.

Lord bless me ! Madam, said Lucy, excessively
astonished, I never, till this Moment,
it seems, knew the hundredth thousandth Part

of what was expended from me: I am sure, if I
had, I would never nave gone to Service; for I
might well know I ;.,as not fit for such Slavery.

There is no such great Slavery in doing all I
have mentioned to you, interrupted Arabella : It
requires, indeed, a good Memory, in which I
never thought you deficient; for you are
punctual to the greatest Degree of Examines in
recounting every thing one desires to hear from
you.

Lucy, whom this Praise soothed into good
Humour, and flattered with a Belief, that she
was able, with a little Intrusion, to perform
what her Lady required, told her, if she pleased
only to put her in a Way how to tell her
History, the would engage, after doing it once,
to tell it again whenever she was desired.

Arabella, being obliged to comply with the
odd Request, for which there was no Precedent
in all the Romances her Library was stuffed
with, began to inform her in this manner:

First, said the, you must relate my Birth,
which you know is very illustrious; and, because
I am willing to spare you the Trouble of
repeating Things, that are not absolutely necessary,
you must apologize to your Hearers for
shipping over what paled in my Infancy, and the
first Eight or Teniers of my Life; not failing,
however, to remark, that, from some sprightly
Sallies of Imagination, at those early Years,
those about me conceived marvellous Hopes of
my future Understanding: From thence you
must proceed to an accurate Description of my
Person.

What! Madam, interrupted Lucy, must I
tell what Sort of,Perfon you have, to People
who have seen you but a Moment ago ?

Questionless you must, replied Arabella; and
herein you follow the Examples of all the 'Squires
and Maids who relate their Matters and Ladies
Fissures: For, though it be to a Brother, or
near Relation, who has seen them a thousand
times, yet they never omit an exact Account of
their Persons.

Very well, Madam, said Lucy: I shall be
fire not to forget that Part of my Story. I with
I was as perse in all the rest.

Then, Lucy, you must repeat all the conversations
I have ever held with you upon the
Subjects of Love and Gallantry, that your Audience
may be so well acquainted with my
Humour, as to know exactly, before they are
told, how I shall behave, in whatever Adventures
befal mes-After that, you may proceed
to tell them, how a noble Unknown saw me at
Church; how prodigiously he was firuckwith
my Appearance; the tumultuous Thoughts
that this first View of me occasioned in his
Mind.

Indeed, Madam, interrupted Lucy again, I
can't pretend to tell his Thoughts: For how
should I know what they were ? None but
himself can tell that.

However that may be, said Arabella, I expect
you should decipher all his Thoughts, as
plainly as he himself could do; otherwise my
History will be very imperfect: Well, I suppose
you are at no loss about that whole Adventure,
in which you yourself bore so great a Share; i

need not give you any further Inllh'urions
concerning it: Only you mull be sure, ass
said before, not to omit the least circumstance
in my Behaviour, but relate everything
I d fid, a, nd thought, upon that occasion.
The disguised Gardener must appear
next in your Story: here you will of necessity
be a little deficient, since you are not able to
acquaint your Hearers with his true Name and
Quality; which, questionless, is very illustrious.
However, above all, I must charge you not to
mention that egregious Mistake about the Carp;
for, you know how-here

Miss Glanville's Entrance put a Flop to
the Instructions Lucy was receiving: For she
told Arabella, that Sir George was gone.

How! returned the, is he gone ? Truly I
am not much obliged to him for the Indifference
he has shewed to hear my Story.

Why, really, Madam, said Miss Glanville,
neither of us expected you would be as good
as yourWord, you were so long in sending your
Woman down: And my Brother persuaded Sir
George you were only in Jest; and Sir George has
carried him home to Dinner.

And is it at Sir George's, replied Arabella,
that your Brother hopes to meet with an Occasion
of clearing himself ? He is either very insensible
of my Anger, or very conscious of his
own Innocence.

Miss Glanville, having nothing to say in
Answer to an Accusation she did not understand,
changed the Discourse: And the two
Ladies palled the rest of the Day together, with
tolerableGood-humour on Miss Glanville's Side;

who was in great hopes of making a Con!iqlucf
of the Baronet, before whom isabella had
made herself ridiculous enough: But tha. Ladjr
was far from being at Ease ; the had laid herself
under a Necessity of banishing Mr. Glanville, if
he did not give some convincing Proof of his
Innocence; which, as Matters flood, she
thought would be very hard for him to procure;
and, as she could not absolutely believe him
guilty, (le was concerned she had gone so far.

CH A P. VI.
A very Heroic Chapter.
.M R. Glanville, coming home in the Evening,

a little elevated with the Wine,
of which he had drank too freely at Sir George's,
being told the Ladies were together, entered the
Room where they were sitting; and, beholding
isabella, whose Pensiveness had given an inchanting
Softness to her Face, with a Look of
extreme Admiration-upon

my Soul, Coulin, said he, if you continue
to treat me so cruelly, you'll drive me
mad. How I could adore you this Moment,
added he, gazing passionately at her, if I might
but hope you did not hate me !

Arabella, who did not perceive the Condition
he was in, was better pleased with this Address
than anyhe had reversed; and, therefore, instead

of chiding him, as she was wont, for the Freedom
of his Expressions, she cast her bright Eyes
upon the Ground, with so charming confusion,
that glanville, quite transported, threw himself on
his Knees before her; and, taking her Hand,
attempted to press it to his Lips: Lut fie,
hastily withdrawing it-from

whence is this new Boldness ? said flie:
And what is it you would implore by that prostrate
Posture ? I have told you already upon
what Conditions i will grant you my Pardon.
Clear yourself being an Accomplice with my
designed Ravisher, and I am ready to restore
you to my Esteem.

Let me perish, Madam, returned Glanville,
if I would not die to please you, this Moment!

It is not your Death that I require, said she:
And, though you should never be able to justify
yourself in my Opinion, yet you might, haply,
expiate your Crime, by a less Punishment than
Death.

What shall I do, then, my Angelic Cousin ?
resumed he.

Truly, said she, the Sense of your Offence
ought so mortally to affliA you, that you should
invent some strange kind of Penance for yourself,
severe enough to prove your Penitence sincere.
You know, I suppose, what the unfortunate
Orontes did, when he found he had
wronged his adored Thalefris by an injurious
Suspicion.

I with he had hanged himself, said Mr. Glanville,
rising up in a Passion, at seeing her again
in her Altitudes.

And why, pray, Sir, said Arabella, arc yot;
so revere upon that poor Prince? who was,
haply, infinitely more innocent than yourself.

Severe, Madam! said Glanville, fearing he
had offended her: Why, to be sure, he was a
sad Scoundrel, to use his adored ThaleJlris as he
did: And I think one cannot be too severe
upon him.

But, returned Arabella, Appearances were
against her; and he had some Shadow of Reason
for his Jealousy and Rage: Then, you know,
amidst all his Transports, he could not be prevailed
upon to draw his Sword against her.

What did that signify ? said Glanville: I suppose
he scorned to draw his Sword upon a
Woman: That would have been a Shame indeed.


That Woman, Sir, resumed Arabella, was
not such a contemptible Antagonist as you think
her: And Men, as valiant, possibly, as Orontes
(though, questionless, he was one of the most
valiant Men in the World), have been cut in
Pieces by the Sword of that brave Amazon.

Lord bless me! said Miss Glanville, I should
be afraid to look at such a terrible Woman: I
am sure she muss be a very masculine Sort of
Creature.

You are much mistaken, Miss, said Arabella:
For Thaleflris, tho' the most flout and courageous
of her Sex, was, nevertheless, a per-set
Beauty; and had as much Harmony and
Softness in her Looks and Person, as she had
Courage in herbert, and Strength in her Blows.

Indeed, Madam, resumed Miss Glanville, you
can never persuade me, that a Woman who can

sight, and cut People to Pieces with her Blows,
can have any Softness in her Pcrifn : She must
needs have very masculine Hands, that could
give such terrible Blows: And I can have no
Notion of the Harmony of a Person's Looks,
who, by what you say, must have the Heart of
a Tyger. But, indeed, I don't think there ever
could be such a Woman.

What! Miss, interrupted Arabella: Do you
pretend to doubt, that there ever was such a
Person as Tlbaleflris, Queen of the Amazons?
Does not all the World know the Adventures
of that illustrious Princess; her Affection for the
unjust Orontes, who accused her of having a
scandalous Intrigue with Alexander, whom file
went to meet, with a very different Design, upon
the Borders of her Kingdom? The injurious
Letter he wrote her, upon this Suspicion, made
her resolve to seek for him all over the World,
to give him that Death he had merited, by her
own Hand: And it was in those Rencounters
that he had with her, while she was thus incensed,
that he forbore to defend himself against
her, though her Sword was often pointed to his
Breast.

But, Madam, interrupted Mr. Glanville,
pray what became of this Queen of the amazons
? Was she not killed at the Siege of Troy ?

She never was at the Siege of Troy, returned
Arabella: But The assisted the Princes who besieged
Babylon, to recover the'Liberty of Station
and Parifatis: And it was in the opposite
Party that the met with her faithless Lover.
-If he was faithless, Madam, said Mr. Glanville,
he deserves to die; And I will, with all

my Soul, she had cut him in Pieces with that
famous Sword of hers that had done such Wonders.


Yet this faithless Man, resumed Arabella,
whom you seem tohave buchan Aversion to, gave
so glorious a Proof of his Repentance and Sorrow,
that the fair Queen restored him to her
Favour, and held him in much dearer Affection
than ever: For, after he was convinced of her
Innocence, he was resolved to punish himself
with a Rigour equal to the Fault he had been
guilty of; and, retiring to the Woods, abandoned
for ever the Society of Men; dwelling in a
Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, passing the
Days and Nights in continual Tears and Sorrow
for his Crime : And here he proposed to
end his Life, had not the fair malcfltris found
him out in this Solitude; and, struck with the
Sincerity of his Repentance, pardoned him;
and, as I have said before, restored him to her
Favour.

And, to shew you, said Glanville, that I am
capable of doing as much for you ; I will, if
you insist upon it, seek out for some Cave, and
do Penance in it, like that Orontes, provided
you will come and fetch me out of it, as that
same fair Queen did him.

I do not require so much of you, said Arabella;
for 1 told you before, that, haply, you are
justified already in my Opinion; but yet it is
necessary, you should find out some Method of
convincing the World of your Innocence; other-wife
it is not fit I should live with you upon
Terms of Friendship and Civility.

VOL. I. K Well,

Well, well, Madam, said Glanville, I'11
convince you of my Innocence, by bringing that
Rascal's Head to you, whom you suspect I
was inclined to assist in stealing you away.

If you do that, resumed Arabella, doubtless
you will be justified in my Opinion, and the
World's also ; and I shall have no Scruple to
treat you with as much Friendship as 1 did before.


My Brother is much obliged to you, Madam,
interrupted Miss Glanville, for putting
him upon an ACtion, that would cost him his
Life !

I have so good an Opinion of your Brother's
Valour, said Arabella, that I am persuaded he
will find no Difficulty in performing his Promise
; and I make no question but I shall see him
covered with the Spoils of that Impostor, who
would have betrayed me; and I flatter myself,
he will be in a Condition to bring me his Head,
as he bravely promises, without endangering his
own Life.

Does yourLadyfhip consider, said Miss Glanville,
that my Brother can take away no Person's
Life whatever, without endangering his
own?

I consider, Madam, said Arabella, your Brother
as a Man poflt'fed of Virtue and Courage
enough to undertake to kill all my Enemies
and Persecutors, though I had ever so many;
and I presume, he would be alive to perform
as many glorious Ations for my Service, as
either 7tuba, Calais, Armaments, or Artaban,
who, though not a Prince, was greater than any
of them.

If those Persons you have named, said Miss
Glanville, were Murderers, and made a Practice
of killing People, I hope my Brother will be
too wise to follow their Examples: A strange
kind of Virtue and Courage indeed, to take
away the Lives of one's Fellow-Creatures ! How
did such Wretches escape the Gallows, I wonder
?

I perceive, interrupted Arabella, what kind
of Apprehensions you have: I suppose you
think, if your Brother was to kill my Enemy,
the Law would punish him for it: But pray
undeceive yourself, Miss: The Law has no
Power over Heroes; they may kill as many
Men as they please, without being called to any
Account for it; and the mole Lives they take
away, the greater is their Reputation for Virtue
and Glory. The illustrious Artaban, from the
Condition of a private Man, railed himself to
the sublimest Pitch of Glory by his Valour; for
be not only would win half a dozen Battles ina
Day; but, to shew that Victory followed him
where-ever he went, he would change Parties,
and immediately the Vanquished became conquerors;
then, returning to the Side he had
quitted, changed the Laurels of his former
friends into Chains. He made nothing of
tumbling Kings from their Thrones, and giving
away half a dozen Crowns in a Morning; for
his Generosity was equal to his Courage; and
to this Height of Power did he raise himself
by his Sword. Beginning at first with petty
Conquests, and not disdaining to oppose his
glorious Arm to sometimes less than a Score of
his Enemies; so, by degrees, enuring himself

K 2 toto

conquer inconsiderable Numbers, lie came
at last to be the Terror of whole Armies, who
would fly at the Sight of his single Sword.

This is all very astonishing indeed, said Miss
Glanville: However, Must intreat you, not to
;lifitt upon my Brother's quarrelling and fight
with People, since it will be neither for
four Honour, nor his Safety; for I am afraid,
if he was to commit Murder to please you, the
Laws would make him sussex for it; and the
World would be very free with its Censures on
your Ladyship's Reputation, for putting him
upon such shocking Crimes.

By your Discourse, Miss, replied Arabella,
one would imagine, you knew as little in what
the good Reputation of a Lady consists, as the
Safety of a Man ; for certainly the one depends
intirely upon his Sword, and the other
upon the Noise and Buffle she makes in the
World. 'he Blood that is shed for a Lady,
enhances the Value of her Charms ; and the
more Men a Hero kills, the greater his Glory,
and, by Consequence, the more secure he is.
If to be the Cause of a great many Deaths, can
make a Lady infamous; certainly none were
ever more lo, than Mandana, Cleopatra, and
Statira, the most illustrious Names in Antiquity;
for each of whom, haply, an hundred
thousand Men were killed: Yet none were ever
so unjust, as to profane the Virtue of those Divine
Beauties, by causing any Censures upon
them for there glorious Esteems of their Charms,
and the heroic Valour of their Admirers.

I muss confess, interrupted Miss Glanville,
I should not be for) to have a Duel or Two

sought for me in Hyde-park; but then I would
not have any Blood Shed for the World.

Glanville here interrupting his Sitter with a
Laugh, Arabella also could not forbear smiling
at the harmless Kind of Combats her Cousin
was fond of.

But to put an End to the Conversation, and
the Dispute which gave Rise to it, she obliged
Mr. Glanville to promise to fight with the impostor
Edward, whenever he found him; and
either take away his Life, or force him to confess,
he had no Part in the Design he had meditated
against her.

This being agreed upon, Arabella, conducing
Miss Glanville to her Chamber, retired to
her own; and passed the Night with much
greater Tranquillity, than she had done the
preceding; being satisfied with the Care ole
had taken of her own Glory, and persuaded
that Glanville was not unfaithful; a circumstance,
that was of more Consequence to her
Happiness, than ole was yet aware of.

In? which our Heroine is suffered of Ingens

X -
HILE these things passed at the

Castle, Sir George was meditating on
the Means he should use to acquire the Esteems
of Lady Bella, of whose Person he was a little

K 3 enamoured,

enamoured, but of her Fortune a great deal
more.

By the Observations he had made on her Behaviour,
he discovered her peculiar Turn : He
was well read in Romances himself, and had
actually employed himself some Weeks in giving
a new Version of the Grand Cyrus; but
the prodigious Length of thessaly he had undertaken,
terrified him so much, that he gave it
over: Nevertheless, he was perfectly well acquainted
with the chief Characters in most of
tile French Romances ; could tell every thing
that was borrowed from them, in all the new
Novels that came out; and, being a very accurate
Critic, and a mortal Hater of Dryden, ridiculed
him for want of Invention, as it appeared
by his having recourse to these Books for the
most fining Characters and Incidents in his
Plays. AImnanzor, he would say, was the Copy
of the famous Artaban in Cleopatra, whose Exploits
Arabella had expatiated upon to Miss
Glanville, and her Brother : His admired Character
of Calantha in Marriage a-la-mode, was
!ran from Berij in the Grand Cyrus; and
the Story of Ofnyn and Benfayda, in his Conquest
granada, taken from SefoJ'is and Time-villa
in that Romance.

Fraught therefore with the Knowlege of all
the Extravagances and Peculiarities in those
Books, he resolved to make his Addresses to
Arabella in the Form they prescribed; and,
not having Delicacy enough to be disgusted with
the Ridicule in her Character, served himself
with her Foibles fit. his Designs.

It being necessary, in order to his better Acquaintance
with Arabella, to be upon very
friendly Terms with Miss Giianvile and her
Brother, he said a thousand gallant Things to
one, and seemed so little offended with the
Gluoin he observed upon the Countenance of
the other, who positively allured him, that
Arabella meant only to laugh at him, when (he
promised him her History, that he intreated
him, with the most obliging Earnestness, to favour
him with his Company at his House, where
lie omitted no sort civility, to confirm their
Friendship and Intimacy ; and persuaded him,
by several little and seemingly unguarded Expressions,
that he was not so great an Admirer
of Lady Bella, as her agreeable Cousin Miss
Glanville.

Having thus secured a Footing in the Castle,
he furnished his Memory with all the necessary
Rules of making Love in Arabella's Taste, and
deferred his next Visit no longer than till the
following Day; but Mr. Glanville being indisposed,
and not able to see Company, he knew
it would be in vain to expect to see Arabella,
since it was not to be imagined, Miss Glanville
could admit of a Visit, her Brother being
ill; and Lady Bella must be also necessarily engaged
with her.

Contenting himself, therefore, with having
inquired after the Health of the Two Ladies,
he returned home, not a little vexed at his Disappointment.


Mr. Glanville's Indisposition, increasing every
Day, grew at last dangerous enough to fil his
Sister with extreme Apprehension,. arabella,

K 4 keeping

keeping up to her Forms, sent regularly every
Day, to inquire after his Health; but did not
offer to go into his Chamber, though Miss
Glanville was almost always there.

Asflieconceived his Sickness to be occasioned
by the Violence of his Passion for her, fie expected
some Overture should be made her by
his Sister, to engage her to make him a Visit;
lich a Favour being never granted by any Lady
to a sick Lover, till she was previously informed,
her Presence was necessary to hinder the Increase
of his Distemper.

Miss Glanville would not have failed to represent
to her Cousin the Incivility and Carelessness
of her Behaviour, in not deigning to
come and see her Brother in his Indisposition,
had not Mr. Glanville, imputing this Neglect
to the Nicety of her Notion., which he had
upon other Occasions experienced, absolutely
forbid her to say any thing to her Cousin upon
this Subject.

Miss Glanville being thus forced to Silence,
by the Fear of giving her Brother Uneasiness,
.Isabella was extremely disappointed to find,
that, in Five Days Illness, no Application had
been made to her, either by the sick Lover, or
his Sister, who she thought interested herself
too little in his Recovery ; so that her Glory
obliging her to lay some Constraint upon herself,
Ihe behaved with a Coolness and Insensibility,
that increased Miss Glanville's Aversion
to her, while, in Reality, she was extremely
concerned for her Cousin's Illness; but not
supposing it dangerous, since they had not recourse
to the usual Remedy, of beseeching a

Visit from the Person who e Presence was
alone able to work a Cure, flie resolved to wait
patiently the Event.

However, she never failed in her Respect to
Mils Glanville, whom file visited every' Morning,
before the went to her Brother; and also
constantly dined with her in her own Apartment,
inquiring always, with great Sweetness,
concerning her Brother's Health; when perceiving
her in Tears one Day, as (he came in,
as usual, to dine with her, she was extremely
alarmed; and asked with great Precipitation,
If Mr. Glanville was worse ?

He is so bad, Madam, returned Miss Glanville,
that I believe it will be necessary to send
for my Papa, for fear he should die, and he
not see him.

Die, Miss ! interrupted Arabella eagerly:
No, he muss not die; and shall not, if the Pity
of Arabella is powerful enough to make him
live. Let us go then, Cousin, said she, her
Eyes streaming with Tears ; let us go and visit
this dear Brother, whom you lament: Haply
my Sight may repair the Evils my Rigour
has caused him; and since, as I imagine, he has
forlorn, through the profound Respect he has
for me, to request, the Favour of a Visit, I
will voluntarily bestow it on him, as well for
the Affection I bear you, as because I do not
wish his Death.

You do not wish his Death, Madam! said
Miss Glanville, excessively angry at a Speech,
in her Opinion, extremely insolent: Is it such
a mighty Favour, pray, not to wist the Death
of my Brother, who never injured you ? I am

K 5 sure,

sure, your Bch:wvioaur has been so extremely inhuman,
that i have repented a thousand
times, we ever came to the Castle.

Let us not ware the time in idle Reproaches,
slid Arabella: If my Rigour has brought your
Brother into this Condition, my Compassion
can draw him out of it: It is no more than
what all do sussex, who are possessed of a violent
Passion; and few Lovers ever arrive to the
Pression of their Mistress, without being several
times brought almost to their Graves,
cither by their Severity, or some other Cause:
But nothing is more easy, than to work a Cure,
in these Cases ; foi the very Sight of the Person
beloved sometimes dcxs it, as it happened to
Armaments, when the Divine MAandana condescended
to visit him: A few kind Words,
spoken by the fair Princess of Persia to Oroon-
casts, recalled him from the Gates of Death i
;ind one Line from Parifatis's Hand, which
brought a Command to Lysimachus to live, made
him not only resolve, but even able, to obey
hermits

Glanville, quite out of Patience at this
tedious Harangue, without any Regard to ceremony',
flounced out of the Room; and ran to
her Brother's Chamber, followed by Isabella,
who imputed her rude Haste to a Suspicion,
that her Brother was worse.

their Entrance into the Room, Mass

Glanville inquired us the Physician, just
going out, How he found her Brother ? Who
replied, that hi Fever was increased since last
Night; and that it would not (seeing Arabella
preparing to go ta his Bedside) be proper to
disturb him.

Saying this, he bnw'd, and went out; and
Miss Glanville, repeating what the Physician hud
lid, begged her to dfcer speaking to him till
another time.

1 know, said flie, that he apprehends, the
Sight of me will cause so many tumultuous
Motions in the Soul of his Patient, as miy prrnte
prejudicial to hin: Nevertheless, since hi
Disorder is, quefliun!eic, more in his Mind than
Bodied I may prove, lh.pl', a better Ri. wfician
than he since I arn more likely, than he, to
cure an Illness I have caused

this, she walked up to Mr. Gazelle's
Bedside, who, seeing her, thanked her, with a
weak Voice, for coming to see him assuring
her, he was very sensible of the Favour a- did
him-you

must not, said fne, blushing, thank me
too much, lest I think the Favour I have done
you, is really of more Consequence than [
imagined, since it merits so many Acknowledge

6- ments:


ments: Your Physician tells us, pursued she,
that your Life is in Danger; but I persuade
myself, you will value it so much from this
Moment, that you will not protract your Cure
any longer.

Are you mad, Madam, whispered Miss Glanville,
who stood behind her, to tell my Brother,
that the Physician says he is in Danger ?
I suppose you really with he may die, or you
would not talk so.

If, answered fie, whispering again to Miss
Glanville, you are not satisfied with what I have
already done for your Brother, I will go as 'far
as Modesty will permit me: And gently pulling
open the Curtains;

Glanville, said she, with a Voice too much
Tailed for a tick Person's Ear, I grant to your
Sifter's Solicitations, what the fair Stairs did
to an Interest yet more powerful, since, as you
know, it was her own Brother, who pleaded
in Favour of the dying Orontes: Therefore,
considering you in a Condition haply no less
dangerous, than that of that passionate Prince,
I condescend, like her, to tell you, that I do not
wish your Death; that I intreat you to live;
and, lastly, by all the Power I have over you,
I command you to recover.

Ending these Words, she closed the Curtain,
that her transported Lover might not see her
Blushes and Confusion, which were so great,
that, to conceal them, even from Miss Glanville,
she hurried out of the Room, and retired
to her own Apartment, expecting, in a little
time, to receive a Billet, under the sick Man's
Hand, importing, that, in Obedience to her

Commands, he was recovered, and ready to
throw himself at her Feet, to thank her for that
Life she had bestowed upon him, and to dedicate
the Remains of it to her Service.

Miss Glanville, who flayed behind her, in a
strange Surprize at her ridiculous Behaviour;
though she longed to know what her Brother
thought of it, finding he continued silent,
would not disturb him. The Shame he conceived
at hearing so absurd a Speech from a
Woman he passionately loved ; and the Desire
he had, not to hear his Sister's Sentiments upon
it; made him counterfeit Sleep, to avoid
any Discourse with her upon so disagreeable a
Subject.

That Day his Fever increased; and the next,
the Physician pronouncing him in great Danger,
a Messenger was dispatched to Town, to
hasten the Coming of Sir Charles and poor
Miss Glanville was quite inconsolable, under
the Apprehensions of losing him.

Arabella, not to derogate from her Character,
affected great Firmness of Mind upon this occasion
; she used the most persuasive Eloquence
to moderate her Cousin's Afflition, and caused
all imaginable Care to be taken of Mr. Glanville:
While any one was present, her Looks
discovered only a calm and decent Sorrow;
yet when she was alone, or had only her dear
Lucy with her, she gave free Vent to her Tears;
and discovered a Grief for Mr. Glanville's Illness,
little different from that the had felt for her
Father's.

As she now visited him constantly every Day,
she took an Opportunity, when flie was alone

by his Bedside, to chide him for his Disobedience,
in not recovering, as the had commanded
him.

Dear Cousin, answered he faintly, Can you
imagine, Health is not my Choice? And do
you think, I would fiiffr there Pains, if I could
possibly ease myself of them ?

Those Pains, replied isabella, mistaking his
Complaint, ought to have ceased, when the
Cause of them did ; and when I was no longer
rigorous, you ought no longer to have suffered:
But tell me, since you are, questionless,
one of the strangest Men in the World, and
the hardest to be comforted; nay, and I may
add, the most disobedient of all, that ever
wore the Fetters of Love; Tell me, 1 say,
what must I do to content you ?

If I live, Cousin, said Glanville-nay,
interrupted Arabella, since my Empire
over you is not so absolute as I thought; and
since you think fit to reserve to yourself the
Liberty of dying, contrary to my Desire; I
think I had better resolve, not to make any
Treaty with you: However, as I have gone
thus far, I will do something more; and tell
you, since I have commanded you to live, I
will also permit you to love me, in order to
make the Life I have bestowed on you, worthy
your Acceptance. Make me no Reply, said
the, putting her Hand on his Mouth; but begin
from this Moment to obey me.

Saying this, Ihe went out of the Room
few Hours after, his Fever being come to
a Height, he grew delirious, and talked very
wildly ; but a favourable Crisis ensuing, he fell

into a sound and quiet Sleep, and continued in
it for several Hours: Upon his waking, the
Physician declared, his Fever was greatly abated;
and the next Morning, pronounced him
out of Danger-miss

Glanville, transported with Jov, ran to
LadyBella, and informed her of this good News;
but as she did not make her the Acknowledgments
fie expected, for being the Cause of his
Recovery, she behaved with more Reserve
than Miss Glanville thought was necessary:
Which renewed her former Difgufts;yet, blinding
to displease her Brother, she concealed it
from the Observation of her Cousin-arabella,

being desirous of completing her
Lover's Cure by some more favourable Expressions,
went to his Chamber, accompanied
by Miss Glanville.

I see, said she, approaching to his Bedside,
with an inchanting Smile, that you know how
to be obedient, when you please; and I bezrin
to know, by the Price you set upon your Obedience,
that small Favours will not content you.

Indeed, my dearest Cousin, said Glanville,
who had found her more interested in his Recovery
than he expected, you have been very
obliging, and I will always moi gratefully own
it.

I am glad, interrupted Arabella, that Gratitude
is not banished from all your Family; and
that that Person in it, for whom I have the molt
Sensibility, is not intirely divested of its

hope, said Mr. Glanville, my Sister has
given you no Cdufc to complain of her.

Indeed but file has, replied Arabella; for,
notwithstanding fie is obliged to me for the
Life of a Brother, whom questionless the loves
very well; nevertheless, The did not deign to
make me the least Acknowlegement for what I
have done in your Favour: However, Glanville,
provided you continue to observe that
Respect and Fidelity towards me, which 1 have
Reason to hope for from you; your Condition
shall be never the worse for Miss Glanville's un-acknowledging
Temper; and I now confirm
the Grant I Yesterday made you, and repeat
it again ; That I permit you to love me, and
promise you not to be displeased at any Testimonies
you will give me of your Pafion, provided
you serve me with an inviolable Fidelity.

But, Madam, returned Mr. Glanville, to
make my Happiness complete, you mull also
promise to love me; or else what signifies the
Permission you give me to love you ?

You are almost as acknowledging as your
Sister, resumed Arabella, blushing; and if your
Health was perfectly re-established, questionless,
I should chide you for your Presumption; but
since something must be allowed to sick Persons,
whose Reason, one may suppose, is weakened
by their Indisposition, I will pardon your
Indiscretion at this time, and counsel you to
wait patiently for what Heaven will determine
in your Favour: Therefore endeavour to merit
my AffeCtion by your Respect, Fidelity, and
Services; and hope from my Justice, whatever
it ought to bestow-ending

this Speech, with a Solemnity of Accent,
that gave Mr. Glanville to underhand,

any Reply would offend her, he silently kissed
her fair Hand, which flie held out to him ; a
Favour, theseus upon which they now were,
and his Sickness, gave him a Right to expect-and,
finishing her Visit for that time, left him
to his Repose ; being extremely pleased at the
Profpea of his Recovery, and very well satisfied
at having so gracefully got over so great a Difficulty,
as that of giving him Permission to love
her: For by the Laws of Romance, when a Lady
has once given her Lover that Permission, she
may lawfully allow him to talk to her upon the
Subjea of his Passion, accept all his Gallantries,
and claim an absolute Empire over all his
Actions; reserving to herself the Right of fixing
the Time when flie may own her Affection:
And when that important Step is taken, and his
Constancy put toa few Years more Trial; when
he has killed all his Rivals, and rescued her from
a thousand Dangers ; file at lait condescends to
reward him with her Hand; and all her Adventures
are at an End for the future,

In which eur Heroine discovers her Knowlege

I R George, who had never missed
a Day, during Mr. Glanville's
Illness, in sending to the Castle,
now he was able to see Company,
visited him very frequently; and
sometimes had the Happiness to
meet with Arabella in his Chamber: But,
knowing the Conditions of her Father's Will,
and Mr. Glanville's Pretensions, he was obliged
to lay so much Constraint upon himself, in the
Presence ofMiG Glanville, and her Brother, that

he hardly durst trust his Eyes, to express his Admiration
(f her, for Fear of alarming them with
any Suspicion of his Designs: However, he
did not fail to recommend himself to her
Esteem, by a Behaviour to her full of the most
perse Respect ; and very often, ere he was
aware, uttered Come of the extravagant Compliments,
that the Gallants in the French Romances
use to their Mistresses.

If he walked with her in the Gardens, he
would observe, that the Flowers, which were
before languishing and pale, bloomed with fresh
Beauty at her Approach ; that the Sun shined
out with double Brightness, to exceed, impossible,
the Lustre of her Eyes; and that the Wind,
fond of kissing her celestial Countenance, played
with her fair Hair; and, by gentle Murmurs)
declared its Happiness

Miss Glanville happened to be present,
when he talked to her in this Strain, the would
suppose he was ridiculing her Cousin's fantastical
Turn; and when she had an Opportunity
of speaking to him alone, would chide hin
with a great deal of good Humour, for giving
hrr so much Diversion at her Cousin's Expence.


Sir George, improving this Hint, persuaded
Miss Glanville by his Answers, that he really
laughed at Arabella ; and, being now less fearful
of giving any Suspicion to the gay Coquet,
since the assisted him to deceive her, he applied
himself, with more Assiduity than ever, to insinuate
himself into Arabella's Favour.

However, the Necessity; he was under of being
always of Arabella's Opinion, sometimes

drew him into little Difficulties with Miss Glanville.
Knowing that young Lady was extremely
fond of Scandal, he told her, as a most agreeable
Piece of News, one Afternoon when he
was there, that he had seen Miss Groves, who,
he supposed, had come into the Country upon
the same Account as she had done a Twelvemonth
before: Her Marriage being yet a
Secret, the complaisant Baronet threw out an
Hint or two, concerning the Familiarity and
Correspondence there was between her and the
Gentleman to whom she was really secretly
married.

Miss Glanville, making the mole of this Intelligence,
said a thousand severe Things against
the unfortunate Miss Groves; which Arabella,
always benevolent and kind, could not bear.

I persuade myself, said she to her Cousin,
that you have been misinformed concerning this
Beauty, whose Misfortunes you aggravate by
your cruel Censures; and whoever has given
you the History of her Life, has, haply, done it
with great Injustice-why,

Madam, interrupted Miss Glanville,
do you think you are better acquainted with her
History, as you call it, who have never been in
Town, where her Follies made her so remarkable,
than Persons who were Eye-witnesses of
all her ridiculous Ations ?

I apprehended Arabella, that I, who have
had a Relation made to me of all the Passages
of her Life, and have been told all her most
secret Thoughts, may know as much, if not
more, than Persons who have lived in the same
Place with her, and have not had that Advantage;

and I think, I know enough to vindicate
her from many ciucl Aspersions.

Pray, Madam, returned Mils Glanville, will
your Ladyship pretend to defend her scandalous
Commerce with Mr. L- ?

I know not, Miss, laid isabella, why you
call her Intercourse with that perjured Man by
so unjust an Epithet. It Miss Groves be unchaste,
so was the renowned Cleopatra, whose Marriage
with 'aulis Ccijar is controverted to this Day.

And what Reasons, Madam, laid Miss Grains
have you fbr supposing, Its Groves was
married to Mr. L , since all the World
knows to the contrary ?

Very sufficient ones, said Arabella; since it is
hardly possible to suppose, a young Lady of M ifs
Groves's Quality would tain the Lustre of her
crescent by so shameful an Intrigue ; and also,
since there are Examples enough to be found of
Persons, who suffered under the same unhappy
Circumstances as herself; yet were perfectly
innocent, as was that great Queen I have mentioned
; who questionless, you, Sir, are sufficiently
convinced, was married to that illustrious
Conqueror; who, by betraying so great and si
fair a Queen, in great measure tarnished the
Glory ot his Laurels-married,

Madam! replier Sir George: Who
presumes to say, that fair Queen was not married
to that illustrious Conqueror ?

Nay, you know, Sir, interrupted Arabella,
many People did say, even while the was living,
that she was not married; and have branded her
Memory with infamous Calumnies, upon Account
of the Son she had by Cefar, the brave

C.vfiuio, who, under the Name of Cloismedon,
performed filch Miracles of Valour in Ethiopia.

I allure you, Madam, said Sir George, I was
always a great Admirer of the famous Cleome-don,
who was certainly the greatest Hero in the
World.

Pardon me, Sir, said Arabella; CIcomedon
was, questionless, a very valiant Man; but he,
and all the Heroes that ever were, muff give
place to the unequalled Prince of Mauritania;
that illustrious, and for along time unfortunate,
Lover of the Divine Cleopatra, who was Daughter,
as you questionless know, of the great
Queen we have been speaking of-dear

Heart ! said Mis Glanville, What is
all this to the Purpose ? I would fain know,
whether Sir George believes, Miss Groves was
ever married to Mr. L-.

Doubtless, I do, said he ; for, as Lady Bella
says, she is in the same unhappy Circumstance
with the great Cleopatra ; and if Julius Cefar
could be guilt)' of denying his Marriage with
that Queen, I see no Reason to suppose, why
Mr. L- might not be guilty of the same
kind of Injustice.

So then, interrupted Miss Glanville, blushing
with Spite, you will really offer to maintain,
that Mils Groves was married? Ridiculous!
How such a Report would be laughed at in London
!

I allure you, replied Arabella, if ever I go to
London, I shall not scruple to maintain that
Opinion to every one, who will mention that
Fair-one to me ; and ufc all my Endeavours to
confirm them in it.

Your Ladyship would do well, said Mils
Glanville, to persuade People, that Miss Groves,
at Fifteen, did not want to run away with her
Writing-master.

As I am persuaded myself, said Arabella, that
'Writing maier was some noble Stranger in
Disguise, who was passionately in Love with her,
I shall not sussex any body, in my Hearing, to
propagate such an unlikely Story ; but since he
was a Person worthy of her Affection, if the had
run away with him, her Fault was not without
Example, and even Excuse: You know what
the fair artemisia did for Alexander, Sir, pursued
[he, turning to Sir Gorge : I would fain
know your Sentiments upon the Action of that
Princess, which some have not scrupled to condemns


Whoever they are, Madam, said Sir George,
who condemn the fair Artemisia for what she
did for Alexander, are Miscreants and Slanderers;
and though that beautiful Princess has
been dead more than Two thousand Years, I
would draw my Sword in Defence of her Character,
against all who should presume, in my
Presence, to cast any Censures upon it.

Since you are so courageous, said Miss Glanville,
laughing excessively at this Sally, which,
she thought, was to ridicule her Cousin ; it is
to be hoped, you will defend a living Lady's
Character, who may thank you for it; and
make the World believe, that her, Correspondence
with Mr. L was intirely innocent;
and that (he never had any Design to run away
with her Writing-master,

Are you resolved, Cousin, said Lady Bclla,
to persist in that ridiculous Mistake, and take
a Nobleman for a Writing-master only because
his Love put him upon such a Stratagem
to obtain his Mistress?

Indeed, LadyBella, said Miss Glanville, smiling,
you may as well persuade me, the Moon
is made of a Cream Cheese, as that any Nobleman
turned himself into a Writing-master, to
obtain Miss Groves

it possible, Miss, said Arabella, that you
can offer such an Affront to my Understanding,
as to suppose, I would argue upon such a ridiculous
Syren m; and compare the Second glorious
Luminary of the Heavens to so unworthy
a Resemblance ? 1 have taken some Pains
to contemplate the Heavenly Bodies; and, by
Reading and Observation, am able to comprehend
some Part of their Excellence : Therefore
it is not probable, I should descend to such
trivial Comparisons; and liken a Planet, which,
haply, is not much less than our Earth, loathing
so inconsiderable, as that you name-pardon

me, dear Cousin, interrupted Miss
Glanville, laughing louder than before, if I divert
myself a little with the Extravagance ol
your Notions. Really I think, you have no
Reason to be angry, if I supposed you might
make a Comparison between the Moon and
a Cream Cheese; since you say, that same
Moon, which don't appear broader than your
Gardener's Face, is not much les; than the
whole World : Why, certainly, I live snore
Reason to trust my own Eyes, than such whimsical
Notions as thcfc.

VOL. I. L ,,:,,

Arabella, unwilling to expose her Cousin's Ignorance,
by a longer Dispute upon this Subject,
begged her to let it drop for the present;
and, turning to Sir George, I am very glad, laid
Ille, that having always had some Inclination to
excuse, and even defend, the Flight of Airte-
nina with Alexander, my Opinion is warranted
by that of a Person so generous as yourself: Indeed,
when we consider, that this Princess forsook
her Brother's Dominions, and fled away
with a Lover whom she did not hate ; questionless,
her Enemies accuse her, with some Appearance
of Reason, of too great Imbecility.

But, Madam, replied Sir George, her Enemies
will not take the Pains to examine her
Reasons for this Conduct-true,

Sir, resumed Arabella; for she was in
Danger of seeing a Prince, who loved her, put to
a cruel and infamous Death upon a public Scaffold
; and she did not resolve to fly with him,
till all her Tears and Prayers were found ineffectual
to move the King her Brother to
Mercy.

Tho', replied Sir George, I am extremely
angry with the indiscreet Clio, who discovered
Alexander to the Armenian King; yet what does
your Ladyship think of that gallant Ation of
his, when he saw him upon the Scaffold, and
the Executioner ready to cut off his Head ? How
brave it was of him, to pass undauntedly thro'
the prodigious Number of Guards that environed
the Scaffold; and, with his drawn Sword, run
the Executioner through-the Body, in the Sight
of them all! Then giving the Prince another

Sword, engage more than Two thousand Menin
his Defence!

Questionless, replied Arabella, it was a glorious
Action; and when I think, how the King
of Armenia was enraged to see such a Multitude
of Soldiers fly from the Swords of Two
Men, I cannot choose but divert myfelfwith
the Consternation he was in : Yet that was nothing
to the horrible Despair, which tormented
him afterwards, when he found, that Alexander,
after being again taken and imprisoned, had
broken his Chains, and carried away with hill
the Princess rti.iiefa his Sister.

C HA P. II.
In which a very pleasing Cc;'nvrfation is

A S Arabella was in this Part of her Discourse,

a Servant came to inform her, that
Sir Charles Glanville was just alighted. Upon
which, Miss Glanville flew to receive her Father;
and Arabella, walking a little flower after her,
gave Sir George an Opportunity of holding a little
longer Conversation with her.

I dare believe, Madam, said he, when you
read the Story of the unformniite /VY/-and,-,
your fair Eyes did not refuse to shed smit:'
Tears at the barbarous and fnamcfitl Dira;;
he was going to sussex: Yet I afluie )ou, time
melancholy as his Situation wa;. it ' j alb ' :v

L : .' '., . :,

glorious for him, since he had the sublime
Satisfaction of dying for the Person he adored;
and had the ravishing Pleasure to know, that his
Fate would draw Tears from that lovely Princess,
for whom he sacrificed his Life: Such a
Condition, Madam, ought to be envied rather
than pitied; for, next to the Happiness possessing
the Person one adores, certainly the
Glory of dying for her is moi to be coveted.

arabella, pleasingly surprised to hear Language
so conformable to her own Ideas, looked
for a Moment upon the Baronet, with a most
inchanting Complaisance in her

must be confessed, Sir, laid she, that you
speak very rationally upon these Matters; alit
by the Tenderness and Generosity of your Sentiments,
you give me Cause to believe, that
your Heart is prepossessed with some. Object
worthy of inspiring them.

Sir George seeming, as if he struggled to suppress
a Sigh; You are in the right, Madam,
said he, to suppose, that if my Heart be
prepossessed with any Object, it is with one,
who is capable of inspiring a very sublime Passion
; and I assure you, if ever it submits to any
Fetters, they shall be imposed on me by the
fairest Person in the World-since

Love is not voluntary, replied arabella,
smiling, it may happen, that your Heart
may be surprised by a meaner Beauty, than
such a one as you describe: However, as a
Lover has always an extraordinary Partiality
for the beloved ObjEt, 'tis probable, what
you fly may come to pas ; and you may b::

in Love with the fairest Person in the World,
ill your own Opinion.

They were now so near the House, that Sir
George could reply no other ways, than by a very
passionate Glance, which arabella did not oh-serve,
being in hate to pay her Respects to her
Uncle, who:n he met just going to Mr. Glanville.
Her Looks were directed to him. Si
Charles saluting her with great Affection, they
all went into Mr. Glanville's Chamber, who
received his Father with the utmost Refpet and
Tenderness; extremely regretting the Trouble
he had been at in taking a Journey to the
Castle upon his Account i and gently blaming
his Sister for her Precipitancy in alarming him
so soon.

Sir Charles, extremely overjoyed to find hin
so well recovered, would not allow him to
blame Miss Glanville for what she had done;
but, addressing himself to his Niece, he thanked
her for the Care she had taken of Mr. Neville,
in very obliging Terms.

Arabella could not help blushing at her
Uncle's Compliment, supposing he thanked ix:
for having restored her Cousin to his Health.

I assure you, Sir, said she, Mr. Glanville is
less obliged to my Commands, than to the
Goodness of his Constitution, for his Recovery
and herein he was not so obedient, as many
Persons I could name to him.

Mr. Glanville, willing to prevent the Company's
Observation upon this Speech, began to
acquaint his Father with the Rise and Progresses
his Distemper: But though the old
Gentleman whitened with great Attention to his

L 3 Son,

Son, while he was speaking ; yet not having lost
a Word of wlht arabella had said, as soon as lie
was done, he turned to his Niece, and asked
:cr, how she could be bo unjust, to accuse his
o.)n of Disobedience, because he did not reco-
xr, when the commanded him ? Why, Ma-imam,
added he, you want to carry your Power
;dirtier then ever any Beauty did before you;
since you pretend to make People sick and well,
whenever you please.

Really, Sir, replied Arabella, I pretend to
no more Power, than what I presume all others
.o my Sex have upon the like Occasions; and
since nothing is more common, than for a
Gentleman, though ever so tick, to recover in
Obedience to the Commands of that Person,
who has an absolute Power over his Life, I
conceive, I have a Right to think myself injured,
if Mr. Glanville, contrary to mine, had
thought proper to die-since,

said the old Gentlemen, smiling, my
Son has so well obeyed your Commands in recovering
his Health, I (hall tremble, lest, in
Obedience to a contrary Command of yours, he
Should die, and deprive me of an Heir ; a Misfortune,
which, if it (hould happen, I should
place to your Account.

I assure you, Sir, said Arabella, very gravely,
I have too great an Esteem for Mr. Glanville,
to condemn him to so severe a Punishment as
Death for light Offences: And since it is not
very probable, that he will ever commit such
Crimes against me, as can be only expiated by
his Death such as Infidelity, Disobedience,

ant the like ; you have no Reaobn to fear fur .
a Misfortune by my means-alas

! replied Sir George, you Beauties mate
very nice Distinctions in this Cafes; i:r.i
think, if you (lo not dircctiv command you.
Lovers to die, you are no-was accountable to:
their Death: And when a lover, as it often!
happens, dies through Despair of ever being abs::
to make himself beloved; or, being doomed to
Banishment or Silence, falls into a Fever, from
which nothing but Kindness can recover him ;
and, that being denied, le patiently expires; [
fly, when there 'ling s hippcn, as they certainly
do every Day ; low can you hold yourselves
guiltless of their Deaths, which are apparently
occasioned, either by your Soon c:
Insensibility ?

Sir Charles and miss Glanville were extremely
diverted at this Speech of Sir George's
and Mr. Glanville, thou h he would have wished
he had been raillying.any other Person's Follies
his Cousin's, yet could not help singling ac
the solemn Accent, in which he delivered himself


Arabella, mightily pleased with his Manner of
talking,, was resolved to furnish him with more
Occasions of diverting the Company at her Expence.


I see, answered (lie, you are one of those
Persons, who call a jus Decorum, which all
Ladies, who love Glory as they ought to do,
are obliged to preserve, by the Name of Severity:
But pray, what would you have a Lady
do, whom an importunate Lover presumes to
declare his Passion to ? You know it is notpcr-

L 4 mitted

mitted us to listen to such Discourses; and
you know also, whoever is guilty of rich an
Offence, merits a most rigorous Punishment:
Moreover, you find, that when a Sentence of
Banishment or Silence is pronounced upon them,
these unhappy Criminals are so conscious of the
of justice their Doom, that they never murmur
aganfR their Judge who condemns them; and
therefore, whatever are their Fates, in Consequence
of that Anger they have incurred, the
i.,:dies, thus offended, ought not to be charged
with it, as any cruel Exertion of their Power.

Such Eloquence as yours, Madam, replied
S;r George, might defend Things yet more unjustifiable:
However, you nuit give me Leave,
.A: being interested in the Safety of my Sex,
fill to be of Opinion, that no Man ought to
be hated, because he adores a beautiful Object,
and consecrates all his Moments to her service.


Questionless, resumed Arabella, he will not
be hated, while, out of the Refpet and Reverence
h:e beats her, he carefully conceals his Passion
from her Knowlege; but as soon as ever he
breaks through the Bounds, which that Re-pit
prescribes him, and lets her understand
his true Sentiments, he has Reason to expect
a most rigorous Sentence, since he certainly, by
that Presumption, has greatly deserved it.

If the Ladies, replied Sir George, were more
equitable, and would make some Distinction
between those who really love them in a passionate
and respectful Silence, and others who
do not feel the Power of their Charms, they
might spare themselves the Trouble of hearing

what so mortally offends them: But when a
Lady sees a Man every Day, who by his Looks,
Sighs, and Solicitude to please her, by his numberless
Services and constant Attendance of her,
makes it evident, that his Soul is possessed with
a violent Passion for her; I say, when a Lady
sees, and yet will not see, all this, and persists
in using a passionate Adorer with all the Indifference
due to a Man wholly insensible of the
Power of her Charms; what must he do in
such a mortifying Situation, but make known
his Torments to her that occasions them, ira
order to prevail upon her to have Come Scnfi
of what he does and feels hourly for her sake

But since he gains nothing by the Discovery
of his Passion, resumed Arabella; but, on time
contrary, loses the Advantages he was befor::
polled of, which were very great, since he
might see and discourse with his Mistress every
Day; and, haply, have the Honour to do her a great
many petty Services, and receive sone ot her
Commands; all these Advantages he loses, whPI
he declares he loves : And truly, I think, a Man
who is so unwise as to hazard certain Happiness
for a very improbable Hope, deserves to be
punished, as well for his Folly as Presumption;
and, upon both these Accounts, Banishment i:
not too rigorous a Sentence.

CHAP. III.
Definition of Love and Beauty. -

The necessary qualities of a Hero and
Hero fine.
T HOUGH, replied Mr. Glanville, you

are very severe in the Treatment you think
it necilatry our Sex should receive from yours;
yet I will some of our Town Beauties were,
if not altogether of your Opinion, yet sufficiently
so, as to make it not a Slavery for a
Man to be in their Company ; for unless one
talks of Love to there fair Courts the whole
time one is with them, they are quite displeased,
and look upon a Man who can think
any thing, but themselves, worthy his Thoughts
or Observation, with the utmost Contempt.
How often have you and I, Sir George, pursued
he, pitied the Condition of the few Men of
Sense, who are Sometimes among the Croud of
Beaux, who attend the Two Sister Beauties
to all Places of polite Diversion in Town ? For
those Ladies think it a mortal Injury done to
their Charms, if the Men about them have
Eyes or Ears for any Object but their Faces,
or any Sound but that of their Voices: So that
the Connoisseurs in Music, who attend them to
Ranelagh, must stop their Ears, like Ulysses,
hen the Siren Frafi sings; and the Wits, who
gallant them to the Side box, must lay a much
greater Constraint upon themselves, in order to

resist the Soul-moving Garrick ; and appear il-sensible,
while he is upon tile Stage.

Upon my Soul, added Sir George (forgetting
the Charater he assumed) when I have sec!
some Persons of my Acquaintance talking to
the elders of these Ladies, while one of Congreve's
Comedies has been acting; his Face
quite turned from the Stage, and hers overspread
with an eternal Smile; her file Etc;
sometimes lifted up in a beautiful Sur-prize, ar.!
little inchanting Giggle half-hid with her Fain
spite of their Inattention, 1 haivc been ready
to imagine, he was entertaining her with Remarks
upon the Play, which she was ji,.
pious enough to understand ; and yet I hal:
afterwards been informed by hinmrli', th,
nothing was lets in their Thoughts; and
all that Variety in her Face, and that extreme
seeming Earnestness in his Discourse, was cc -
cautioned by the mos trifling Subjects imaginable:
He perhaps had been telling her, how
the Sight of her Squirrel, which peeped ont of
her Pocket, surprised some Ladies she was
visiting; and what they said upon her 1ilidn!;
for it, when she was gone; bearing then at the
same time for their want of l)eicacy, m i
r:ct
knowing how to set a right Value upon fut h
pleasing Animals : Hence proceeded her Smiles ,
the lifting up of her Eyes, the half-closed
Laugh, and all the pretty Gestures that appeared
so wonderfully charming to al! those who did
not hear their Discourse: And it is utpo: nihil
Trifles as there, or else on the ilexiiifi;!e
Subjec' of their Charms, that all wh. are art m

L. 6 ;mio,;

bilious of being near these Miracles, are under
a Necessity of talking.

And pray, interrupted Arabella, What subject
afford Matter for a more pleasing Variety
of Conversation, than those of Beauty and
Love ? Can we speak of any Objet so capable
of delighting as Beauty, or of any Passion of the
Mind more sublime and pleasing than Love?

with Submission, Madam, said Glanville, I
conceive, all that can be said, either of Beauty,
or of Love, may be comprised in a very few
Words: All who have Eyes, and behold true
Beauty, will be ready to confers it is a very
pleasing Object ; and all that can be said of it,
may be said in very few Words; for when we
have run over the Catalogue of Charms, and
mentioned fine Eyes, fine Hair, delicate Complexion,
regular Features, and an elegant Shape,
we can only add a few Epithets more, such as
Lovely, Dangerous, Inchanting, Irresistible,
and the like ; and every thing that can be said
ps Beauty is exhausts. And so likewise it is
with Love ; we know that Admiration precedes
it, that Beauty kindles it, Hope keeps it
alive, and Despair puts an End to it; and that
Subjec may be as soon discussed as the other,
by the judicious Use of proper Words ; such as
Wounds, Darts, Fires, Languishing, Dying,
Torture, Rack, Jealousy, and a few more of
no Signification, but upon th s Subject.

Certainly, Sir, said Arabella, you have 'not
well considered what you say, since you maintain,
that Love and Beauty are Subjects easily
and quickly discussed : Take the Pains, I beseech
you, to refleCt a litle upon those numerous and

long Conversations, which these Subject have
given Rise to in Clelia, and the Grand Cyrus,
where the most illustrious and greatest Personages
in the World manage the Disputes; and the
agreeable Diversity of their Sentiments on those
Heads affords a molt pleasing and rational Entertainment:
You will there find, that the
greatest Conquerors, and Heroes of invincible
Valour, reason with the most exact and scrupulous
Nicety upon Love and Beauty ; the Superiority
of fair and brown Hair controverted
by Warriors, with as much Eagerness as they
dispute for Victory in the Field; and the different
Effects of that Passion upon discern:
Hearts defined with the utmost Accuracy and
Eloquence.

I mull own, interrupted Sir Charles, I
should have but a mean Opinion of those
Warriors, as you call them, who could busy
themselves in talking of such Trifles; and be
apt to imagine such insignificant Fellows, who
could wrangle about the Colour of their mistresses
Hair, would be the fii(t to turn their
Backs upon the Enemy in Battle.

is it possible, Sir, resumed isabella, glowing
with Indignation, that you can entertain
such unworthy Thoughts of Heroes, who merit
the Admiration and Praise of all Ages for
their inestimable Valour, whom the Spears of
a whole Army opposed to each of their single
Swords would not oblige to fly ? What think
you, Sir, pursued flie, looking at Sir Gorge, of
the injurious Words my Uncle has uttered
against those heroic Princes, whose Courage, I
believe, you areas well acquainted with as myself?

The great Oroondaies, the invincible Artaban,
the valiant and fortunate Armaments, the
irresistible c cuba, the incomparable Cleomnedo;r,
and an hundred other Heroes I could name, are
all injured by this unjust Assertion of my Uncle;
since certainly they were not more famous for
their noble and wonderful Actions in War, than
for the Sublimity and Constancy of their As-seasons
in Love.

Some of there Heroes you have named, replied
Sir George, had the Misfortune, even in
their Lives, to be very cruelly vilified: The
great Mandates was a long time accused or
Treachery to his Divine Princess ; the valiant
and unfortunate Armaments was fifpeacd of
Inconstancy; and the irresistible Juba reproached
with Infidelity and Baseness, by both
his Mistress and Friend.

I never knew you was so well acquainted
with there Persons, interrupted Mr. Glanville;.
and I fans it is but very lately that you have
given yourself the Trouble to read Romances.

I am not of your Opinion, said Arabella.
Sir George, questionless, has appropriated great
Part of hillside to the Perusal of those Books,
so capable of improving him in all useful Knowlege
; the Sublimity of Love, and the Quintessence
of Valour; which Two Qualities, if possessed
in a superlative Degree, form a true and
perfect Hero, as the Perfection of Beauty, Wit,
and Virtue, make a Heroine worthy to be served
by such an illustrious Personage ; and I dare
say, Sir George has profited so much by the
treat Examples of Fidelity and Courage he has
placed before his Eyes, that no Consideration

/

whatreicr could make him for one Moment
fail in his Constancy to the Divine Beauty he
adores; and, inspired by her Charms, he would
scorn to turn his Back, as my Uncle phrases it,
upon an Army of an hundred thousand Men.

Sam extremely obliged to you, Madam, fetid
Sir George, bowing his Head to the Ground,
to hide a Smile he could not possibly restrain,
for the good Opinion you have of my Courage
and Fidelity.

As for Sir Gene's Courage, Cousin, fail
Mr. Glanville laughing, I never disputed it:
And though it be indeed a very extraordinary
Exertion of it, to fight singly against an Army
of an hundred thousand Men; vet since you arc
pleased to think it probable, I am as willing to
believe Sir George may do it as any other Man;
but, as for his Fidelity in Matters of Love, I
greatly fulipea it, since he has been chdr2cd
with omen very flagrant Crimes of that Nature.


How, Sir ! resumed Airabella, Have you ever
been faithless then ? and, after having sworn,
haply, to devote your whole Life to the Service
of some Beauty, have you ever violated your
Oaths, and been baTe enough to forsake her ?

I have too much Complaisance, Madam,
said Sir George, to contradict Mr. Glanville,
who has been pleased positively to assert, that
I have been faithless, as you most unkindly
phrase it.

Nay, Sir, replied Arabella, this Accusation
is not of a Nature to be neglected ; and though
a King should say it, I conceive, if you are
innocent, yvu have a Right to contradict him,

and clear yourself: Do you consider how deeply
this Assertion wounds your Honour and Happiness
for the future? What Lady, think you,
will receive your Services, loaded as you are
with the terrible Imputation of Inconstancy?

Oh ! a; for that, Madam, said Miss Glanville,
I believe no Lady will think the worse
of Sir George for being faithless: For my
Part, I declare, nothing pleases me so much,
as gaining a Lover from another Lady; which
is a greater Compliment to one's Beauty, then
the Addresses of a Man that never was in Love
before-you

may remember, Cousin, replied Arabella,
that I said once before, your Spirit and
Humour resembled a certain girt Princess very
much; and I repeat it again, never was there
a greater Conformity in Tempers and Inclinations.


My Daughter, said Sir Charles, is mightily
obliged to you, Lady Bella, for comparing her
to a great Princess : Undoubtedly you mean it
as a Compliment.

If you think, said Arabella, that barely comparing
her to a Princess be a Compliment, I
must take the Liberty to differ from you: My
Cousin is not so many Degrees below a Princess,
as that such a Comparison should be thought
extraordinary ; for if her Ancestors did not
wear a Crown, they might, haply, have deserved
it; and her Beauty may one Day procure hera
Servant, whose Sword, like that of the great
Artaban, may win her a Sceptre ; who, with a
noble Confidence, told his Princes, when the
Want of a Crown was objected to him, I wear

a Sword, Madam, than can perform things
more difficult, that what you require ; and if
a Crown be all that I want to make me worthy
of you, tell me what Kingdom in the World
you choose to reign in, and I will lay it at your
feet.

That was a Promise, replied Sir George, fit
only for the great Artaban to make: But, Madam,
if you will permit me to make any Comparison
between that renowned Warrior and
myself, I would venture to tell you, that even
the great Artala!o was not exempted from the
Character of Inconstancy any more 'than myself,
since, as you certainly know, he was in
Love with Three great Princesses successively.

I grant you, replied Isabella, that artaban
did wear the Chains of ThreePrinceffes successively:
But it must also be remembred in his
Justification, that the Two First of these Beauties
refused his Adorations, and treated him with
Contempt, because he was not a Prince: Therefore,
recovering his Liberty, by those Disdains
they calf on him, he preserved that illustrious
Heart from Despair, to tender it with more
passionate Fidelity to the Divine Princess of the
Parthian; who, though greatly their Superior
in Quality and Beauty, did permit him to love
her. However, I must confess, I find something
like Levity in the Facility he found in
breaking his Fetters so often ; and when I confider,
that among all those great Heroes, whoso
Histories I have read, none but himself ever
bore, without dying, the Cruelties be experienced
from those Princesses, I am sometimes
;tempted to accuse him myself of Inconstancy .

But indeed every thing we read of that Prodigy
of Valour is wholly miraculous; and since the
Performance of Impossibilities was reserved for
him, I conclude this Miracle alto, among many
others, was possible to him, whom nothing was
ever able to resist upon Earth, However, pursued
she, rising, 1 stall not absolutely condemn
you, till I have heard your Adventures from
your own Mouth, at a convenient Time, when
I shall be able to judge how far you merit the
odious Appellation of Inconstancy.

Saying this, she saluted her Uncle, who had
for rome time been converting in a low Voice
with his Son, with a Grace wholly charming,
and retired to her Apartment. Miss Glanville
following her a few Moments after (the Compliment,
extravagant as it was, which she had
paid her, having procured her some Good-will
from the vain and interested Miss Glanville,
they converted together with a great deal of
good Humour till Dinner-time, which, because
Mr. Glanville was not absolutely recovered,
was served in his Chamber.

CH AP. IV.
In which our Heroine is engaged in a new

AS Mr. Glanville took a great deal of Pains
A to turn the Discourse upon Subjects, on
which the charming Arabella could expatiate,

without any Mixture of that Absurdity, which
mingled itself in a great many others; the rest
cf that Day and several others, were passed
very agreeably: At the End of which, Mr.
Granville being perfectly recovered, and able to
go abroad i the Baronet proposed to take the
Diversion of Hunting; which Arabella, with
was used to it, consented to partake of; but
being informed, that Miss Glanville could not
ride, and chose to slay at home, she would
have kept her Company, had not Sir Charr
insisted upon the contrary.

Astir George, and some other Gentlemen,
had invited themselves to be of the Party; Arabella,
on her coming down to amount her Horse,
found a great many young Gallants, ready to
offer her their Assistance upon this Occasion:
Accepting therefore, with great Politeness, this
Help from a Stranger, who was nearest her, she
mounted her Horse, giving Occasion to everyone
that was present, to admire the Grace with
which she sat and managed him. Her Shape
being as perfect as any Shape could possibly be,
her Riding-habit discovered all its Beauties:
Her Hat, and the white Feather waving over
Part of her fine black Hair, gave a peculiar
Charm to her lovely Face: And she appeared
with so many Advantages in this Dress and
Posture, that Mr. Glanville, forgetting all her
Absurdities, was wholly lost in the Contemplation
of so many Charms, as her whole Person
was adorned with.

Sir George, though he really admired Arabella,
was not so passionately in Love as Mr. Glanville;
and, being a keen Sportsman, eagerly purled

the Game, with the rest of the Hunters;
but Mr. Glanville minded nothing but his cousin,
and kept close by her.

After having rode a long time, Arabella, conceiving
it a Piece of Cruelty, not to give her
Lover an Opportunity of talking to her, as, by
his extreme Solicitude, he seemed ardently to
desire, coming to a delightful Valley, file flopped;
and told Mr. Glanville, that, being weary
of the Chace, she mould alight, and repose
herself little under the Shade of those Trees.

Mr. Glanville, extremely pleased at this
Proposition, dismounted; and, having helped
her to alight, seated himself by her oi the
Grass.

Arabella, expecting he would begin to talk to
her of his Passion, could not help blushing at the
Thoughts of having given him such an Opportunity;
and Mr. Glanville, endeavouring to ac-accommodate
himself to her Ideas of a Lover,
expressed himself inserts extravagant enough
to have made a reasonable Woman think he
was making' a Jeff of her: All which, however,
Arabella was extremely pleated with; and
she observed such a just Decorum in her answers,
that, as the Writers of Romance phrase
it, if she did not give him any absolute Hopes
of being beloved, yet The said enough to make
him conclude The did not hate him.

they had converted in this manner near a
Quarter of an Hour,'when Arablla, perceiving
a Man at a little Distance, walking very composedly,
shrieked out aloud; and, rifingwith the
utmost Precipitation, flew from Mr. Glanville,
and went to untie her Horse while his Astonishment

being so great at her Behaviour, that
he could not, for a Moment or two, ask her
the Cause of her

you not see, said she, out of Breath with
the Violence of her Apprehensions, the Person
who is coming towards us? It is the same,
who, fomeMonths ago, attempted to carry me
away, when I was riding out with only Two
Attendants: I escaped, for that time, the Danger
that threatened me; but, questionless, he
comes now to renew his Attempts: Therefore
can you wonder at my Fear ?

If it should be as you say, Madam, interrupted
Glanville, What Reason have you to
fear? Do you not think I am able to defend
you ?

Ah! without Doubt, you are able to defend
me, answered flie ; and though, if you
offer to resist the Violence he comes to use
against me, he will, haply, call Two or Three
Dozen armed Men to his Assistance, who are,
1 suppose, concealed hereabouts, yet I am
not apprehensive, that you will be worsted
by them: But as it happened to the brave Yuba,
and ClcomelIdo, while they were fighting with
some hundred Men, who wanted to carry away
their Princesses before their Faces; and were
giving Death at every Blow, in order to preserve
them ; the Commander of these Villiers,
seeing the Two Princesses sitting, as I
was, under a Tree, ordered them to be
seized by Two of his Men, and carried away,
while the Two Princes were losing best Part of
of their Blood in their Defence ; therefore,
to prevent such an Accident Happening, while

you are fighting for my Rescue, I think it will
be the safe Way for me to get on Horseback,
that I may be in a Condition to escape;
and that you may not employ your Valour to
no Purpose.

Saying this, having, with Mr. Glanville's
Assistance, loosed her Horse from the Tree, he
helped her to mount, and then remounted his
own.

Your Antagonist, said Arabella, is on Foot;
and therefore, though I prize your Life extremely,
yet I cannot dispense with myself
from telling you, that 'tis against the Laws of
Knighthood to take any Advantage of that
kind over your Enemy; nor will I permit your
Concern for my Safety to make you forget
what you owe to your own Reputation.

Mr. Glanville, fretting excessively at her
Folly, begged her not to make herself uneasy
about things that were never likely to happen.


The Gentleman yonder, added he, seems to
have no Designs to make any Attempt against
you: If he should, I shall know how to deal
with him : But, since he neither offers to assault
me, nor affront you, I think we ought not to
give him unreason to imagine we suspect him,
by gazing on him thus; and letting him understand
by your Manner, that he is the Subject of
our Conversation: If you please, Madam, we
will endeavour to join our Company.

Arabella, while he was speaking, kept her
Eyes fixed upon his Face, with Looks which
expressed her Thoughts were labouring upon
some very important Point: And, after a P life

of tome Moments, Is it possible, said she, with
a Tone of extreme Surprize, that I should be
so mistaken in you ? Do you really want Courage
enough to defend me against that Ra-villiers
?

Oh Heavens! Madam, interrupted Glanville,
try not my Temper thus: Courage
enough to defend you ! 'Sdeath! you will make
me mad ! Who, in the Name of Wonder, is
going to molest you ?

He whom you see there, replied Arabella,
pointing to him with her Finger: For know,
cold and insensible as thou art to the Danger
which threatens me, yonder Knight is thy Rival,
and a Rival, haply, who deserves my Esteem
better than thou dost; since, if lie has Courage
enough to get me by Violence into his Power,
that same Courage would make him defend
me against any Injuries might be offered from
another: And since nothing is to contemptible
in the Eyes of a Woman, as a Lover who
wants Spirit to die in her Defence ; know, I
can sooner pardon him, whom thou would
cowardly fly from, for the Violence which he
meditates against me, than thyself for the
Pusillanimity thou hast betrayed in my Sight.

With these Words, fie galloped away from
her astonished Lover; who, not daring to follow
her, for fear of increasing her Suspicions of his
Cowardice, flung himfelfoff his Horse in a violent
Rage; and, forgetting that the Stranger was
observing, and now within Hearing, he fell accusing
and exclaiming against the Books, that
had turned his. Cousin's Brain and railing at
his own ill Fate, that condemned him to time

Punishment of loving her. Mr. Harvey (for it
really was he, whom an Affair of Consequence
had brought again into the Country), hearing
some of Mr. Glanville's last Words, and observing
the Gestures he used, concluded he
had been treated like himself by Arabella, whom
he knew again at a Distance: Therefore coming
up to Mr. Glanville, laughing-though

I have not the Honour of knowing
you, Sir, said he, I must beg the Favour you
will inform me, if you are not disturbed at the
ridiculous Folly of the Lady I saw with you
just now ? She is the most fantastical Creature
that ever lived, and, in my Opinion, fit for a
Mad-house: Pray, are you acquainted with
her?

Mr. Glanville, being in a very ill Humour,
could not brook the Freedom of this Language
against his Cousin, whose Follies he could not
bear any one should rail at but himself; and, being
provoked at his Sneers, and the Interruption
he had given to their Conversation, he looked
upon him with a disdainful Frown, and told him
in an haughty Tone, That he was very impertinent
to speak of a Lady of her Quality and
Merit so rudely.

Oh! Sir, I beg your Pardon, replied Mr.
Harvey, laughing more than before; What, I
suppose, you are the Champion of this fair Lad !
But, I assure myself, if you intend to quarrel
with every one that will laugh at her, you
will have more Business upon your Hands than
you can well manage.

Mr. Glanville, transported with Rage at this
Insolence, hit him such a Blow with the But-end

of his Whip, that it lunlnecd him for a
Moment; but recovering himself, he drew his
Sword, and, mad with the Affront he had received,
made push at Glanville; who, avoiding
it with great Dexterity, had recourse to his
Hanger for his Defence.

Arabella, in the mean time, who had not rid
far, concealing herself behind some Trees, saw
all the Actions of her Lover, and intended
Ravisher; and, being possessed with an Opinion
of her Cousin's Cowardice, was extremely rejoiced
to see him fall upon his Enemy first, and
that with so much Fury, that flie had no longer
any Reason to doubt his Courage: Her Suspicions,
therefore, being removed, her Tenderness
for him returned; and when she saw
them engaged with their Swords (for, at that
Distance, the did not plainly perceive the Difference
of their Weapons), her Apprehensions
for her Cousin were so ifrong, that, though she
did not doubt his Valour, fie could not bear
to see him expose his Life for her: And,
any Reflections upon the Singularity
of her Design, she was going to ride up to them,
and endeavour to part them; when flie saw several
Men come towards them, whom she took
to be the Assistants of her Ravisher, though
they were, in reality, Haymakers; who, at a
Distance, having seen the Beginning of their
Quarrel, had hastened to part their;.

Terrified, therefore, at this Reinforcement,
which she thought would expose her Cousin to
great Danger, ile galloped, with all Speed,
after the hunters, being directed by the Sound
of the Horn. Her Anxiety for her Cousin made

VoL. I. M er

her rcnardlcf; of her own Danger, so that she
rode with a surprising Swiftness; and, overtaking
the Compass, she would have spoken, to tell
them of her Cousin's Situation when her
Spirits tailing her, she could only make a Sign
with her Hand, and sunk down in a Swoon, in
the Arms of Sir George, who eagerly galloped
up to her; and, supporting her as well as he
was able till some others came to her Relief,
they took her off her Horse, and placed her
upon the Ground; when, by the Help of some
Water they brought from a Spring near them,
in a little time she came td herself.

Sir Cbarles, who, seeing her come up to them
without his Son, and by her fainting, concluded
some Misfortune had happened to him, the
Moment she opened her Eyes, asked her eagerly,
Where he was ?

Your Son, said Arabella, sighing, is, with a
Valour equal to that of the brave Laomedon,
this Moment fighting in my Defence against a
Croud of Enemies; and is, haply, shedding
the last Drop of his Blood in my Quarrel.

Shedding the lait Drop of his Blood, haply!
interrupted Si Charles, excessively grieved; and,
not a little enraged at Arabella, supposing (he
had introduced him into some Quarrel, It maybe
happy for you, Madam; but I am sure it
will make me very miserable, if my Son comes
to any Harm.

If it be the Will of Heaven he should fall in
this Combat, resumed arabella, he can never
have a more glorious Destiny: And as that
Consideration will, doubtless, sweeten his last
Moments, so it ought to be your Consolation:

However, I beg you'll lose no time, but haile
to his Assistance; for since lie has a considerable
Number of Enemies to deal with, 'tis not improbable
but he may be overpowered at hal.

Where did you leave my Son, Madam ? cried
Sir Charles, eagerly.

He is not far oft, replied Arabella: And yotl
will, doubtless, be directed to the Place, byv the
Sight of the Blood of his Enemies, w'.ici-l he
has spilt. Go tramway, pursued she, selling
with her Finger towards the Place . ;',:c
e ile
had left her Cousin: There you will mee with
him, amidst a Croud of Foes, which he is sacrificing
to my Safety, and his just Resentment.

Sir Charles, not knowing what to think, galloped
away, followed by most Part of the Company;
Sir George telling Lady Bella, that he
would stay to defend her against any Attempts
that might be made on her Liberty, by )any of
her Ravisher's Servants, who were, probably,
straggling about. Arc/,e'a, however, being
perfectly recovered, insisted upon following her
Uncle.

There is no Question, said the, but Mr.
Glanville is victories: I am only apprehensive
for the dangerous Wounds he may, have received
in the Combat, which will require all
our Care and Assistance.

Sir George, who wanted to engross her Company
a little to himself, in vain represented to
her, that, amidst the Horrors of a Sight so
bloody as that gulf certainly be, in which Mr.
GlC/nviis and his Friends would be now engaged,
it would be dangerous for her to venture
bh-r Peri:: Yet file would not be persuaded

M z but,

but, having mounted her Horse, with his assistance,
she rode as fast as fie was able after
the rest of the Company.

C H AP. V.
Being a Chapter of Mistakes.
IR Charles, who, by this Time, had got
to the Place the directed him to, but saw
no Appearance of fighting, and only a few
Haymakers in Discourse together, inquired, If
there had been any Quarrel between two Gentlemen
in that Place ?

One of them, at this Question, advancing,
told Sir Charles, that two Gentlemen had quarrelled
there, and were fighting with Swords;
but that they had parted them; and that one of
them, having an Horse tied to a Tree, mounted
him, and rode away: That the other, they believed,
was not far off; and that there had
been no Bloodshed, they having come time
enough to prevent it.

Sir Charles was extremely satisfied with this
Account; and, giving the Haymakers some
Money for the good Office they did in parting
the two Combatants, rode up to meet Lady
Bella; and informed her, that his Son was safe.

I cannot imagine he is safe, replied she, when
I see some of his Enemies (pointing to the Haymakers)
frill alive: It is not customary, in those
Cases, to sussex any to escape: And, questionless,

my Cousin is cither; dead, or a Prisoner,
since all his Adversaries are not vaiiquiiiied.
Why, you dream, madam,
replied SirCb/al,/s
Those Fellows yonder are Haymakers: What
should make them Enemies to my Son ? They
were lucky enough to come in time to prevent
him and another Gentleman from doing each
other a Mischief. I cannot imagine for what
Reason my Son quarrelled with that Person they
speak of: Perhaps you can inform me.
Certainly, Sir, said Arabella, I can inform you,
since I was the Cause of their Quarrel. The
Story is too long to tell you now; and, besides,
it is so connected with the other Accidents of
my Life, that 'tis necessary you mould be acquainted
with my whole History, in order to
comprehend it: But, if those Persons are what
you say, and did really part my Cousin and his
Antagonist, truly I believe they have done him
a very ill Office: For, I am persuaded, my
Coufm will never be at Rest, till, by his Rival's
Death, he has freed himself from one, capable of
the most daring Enterprizes to get me into his
Power: And, since I cannot be in Security
while he lives, and persists in the Resolution he
has taken to persecute me, it had been better if
he had suffered all the Effects of my Cousin's
Resentment at that time, than to give him the
Trouble to hunt him through the World, in
order to sacrifice him to the Interest of his Love
and Vengeance.

Sir Charles, no less astonished than alarmed
at this Discovery of his Niece's sanguinary Sentiments,
told her, he was sorry to see a Lady sofar
forget the Gentleness of her Sex, as to

3 courage

courage and incite Men to such Extremities,
upon her Account. And, for the future, added
he, I muss intreat you, Niece, to spare me the
Affliction of seeing my Son exposed to these
dart-serous Quarrels: For, though his Life is so
little regarded by you, yet it is of the utmost
Consequence to me.

arabella, who found Matter sufficient in the
Beginning of this Speech, to be offended with
her Uncle, yet, mistaking the latter Part of it
ior a pathetic Complaint of her Cruelty, replied
very gravely, That her Coufm's Safety
was not io indifferent to her as he imagined:
And that she did not hate him so much, but
that his Death would affect her very sensibly.

Arabella, in speaking these Words, blushed
with Shame, as thinking they were rather too
tender: And Sir Charles, who coloured like-wife,
from a very different Motive, was opening
his Mouth, to tell her, that he did not
think his Son was much obliged to her for not
hating him; when Arabella, supposing he designed
to press her to a further Explanation of
the favourable Sentiments fne felt for Mr.
Glanville, stopped him with Precipitation: Press
me no more, said she, upon this Subject: And,
as I have already spoken too much, haply, before
so many Witnesses, seek not to enhance
my Confusion, by prolonging a Discourse that
at present must needs be disagreeable to me.

I shall readily agree with you, Madam, replied
Sir Charles, that you have spoken too
much: And, if I had thought you capable of
speaking in the manner you have done, I

would have been more cautious in giving you
an Occasion for it.

I should imagine, ;ir, said ly.'alla, blushing
with Anger, as fie before did with hame,
that you would be the last Person in the World
who could think I had spoken too much upon
this Occasion: And, since you are pleated to
tell me so, I think it fit to let you know, that 1
have not, in my Opinion, transgresses the
Laws of Decency ;end Decorum, in what I
have said in my Cousin's Favour: And I can
produce many Examples of greater Freedom of
Speech, in Princesses, and Ladies of the highest
Quality: However, I fall learn such a Lesson
of Moderation in this respect, from your Reproof,
that I promise you, neither yourself, or
Mr. Glanville, fall have any Cause, for the
future, to complain of my want of Discretion.

Sir Cbarles, who was very polite and good-natured,
was half angry with himself, sir having
obliged his Niece to such a Submission, ashe
thought it; and, apologizing for the Rudeness
of his Reprehension, allied her, that lie
was perfectly convinced of her Discretion in ail
things; and did not doubt but her Condut
would be always agreeable to him.

Arabella, who, from what her Uncle had
said, began to entertain Suspicions, that would
never have entered any Imagination blot hers,
looked earnestly upon him for half a Moment,
as if the willed to penetrate into the most
secret Recesses of his Heart: But, sans ing the
saw something in his Looks that confirmed her
Apprehensions, bhe removed her Eyes from his
Face, and, fattening them on the Ground, rem

4 gained

stained for some Moments in Confusions-Sir
Charles, whom her apparent Disturbance made
very uneasy, proposed returning to the Caffle;
telling Lady Bclla he expected to find his Son
already there.

'Tis more than probable, said she, turning to
Sir George, that my Cousin is gone in Pursuit
of my Ravisher; and the Interruption that has
been given to his designed Vengeance, making
him more furious than before, 'tis not likely he
will return till he has punished his Insolence by
that Death he justly merits.

Mr. Glanville is already so happy in your
Opinion, said Sir George, with a very profound
Sigh, that there is no need of his rendering you
this finally Service, to increase your Esteem:
But, if my Prayers are heard, the Punishment
of your Ravilher will be reserved for a Person
less fortunate, indeed, than Mr. Glanville, tho'
hot less devoted to your Interest, and concerned
in your Preservation.

Sir. George counterfeiting a Look of extreme
Confusion and Fear, as he ended these Words;

Arabella, who perfectly comprehended the
Meaning they were designed to convey, thought
herself obliged to take no Notice of them: And,
therefore, without making any Reply to the
young Baronet, who ventured slowly to lift his
Eyes to her Face, in order to discover if there
were any Signs of Anger in it, the told Sir
Charles she inclined to go home: And Sir
George, with the rest of the Company, attended
them to the Castle; where, as soon as they arrived,
theytook their Leave.

Sir George, notwithstanding Arabella's Care
to deprive him of an Opportunity of speaking
to her, told her, in a Whisper, having eagerly
alighted to help her off her Horse,

I am going, Madam, to find out that info-lent
Man, who has dared to offer Violence to
the fairest Person in the World: And, if I am
so happy as to meet with him, befall either take
myLife, ors will put him into a Condition never
to commit any more Offences of that Nature.

Saying this, he made a low Bow; and, being
desirous to prevent her Answer, remounted
his Horse, and went away with the rest of the
Company.

arabella, who, upon this Occasion, was to
be all Confusion, mixed with some little resentment,
discovered so much Emotion in her
Looks, while Sir George was whispering to her,
that her Uncle, as he was handing her into the
House, asked her, If the was offended at anything
Sir George had said to her ?

Arabella, confirming this Question as the had
done some other things her Uncle had said to
her, replied, in a reserved manner, Since my
Looks, contrary to my Intention, have betrayed
my Thoughts to you, I will not scruple to confess,
that I have some Cause to be offended
with Sir George; and that, in two Instances
To-day, he has seemed to forget the RespeCt
he owes me.

Sir Charles's fired at this Account: Is it
possible, said he, that Sir George has had the
Assurance to say any thing to offend you, and
that before my Face too? This Affront is not
to be borne.

M 5 I am

I am sorry, replied Arabella, eying him heedfully,
to see you so much concerned at it.

Don't be uneasy, interrupted Sir Charles:
There will be no bad Consequences happen from
it: But he hall hear of it, added he, raising
his Voice with Passion: I'll force him this Night
to explain himself.

You must pardon me, Sir, said Arabella,
more and more confirmed in her Notions, if I
tell you, that I am extremely offended at your
uncommon Zeal upon this Occasion: And also
I must assure you, that a little more Calmness
would be less liable to Suspicion.

Miss Glanville coming to meet them, Sir
Charles, who did not take much Notice of
what Arabella said, eagerly inquired for his
Son; and, hearing he was not come home, was
apprehensive of his meeting again with the Person
he had quarrelled with: But his Fears did
not last long; for Mr. Glanville came in, having
purposely avoided the Company, to hide the
Uneasiness Lady Bella's tormenting Folly had
given him.

CH A P. VI.
In which the Mistakes are continued.
A S soon as Mr. Glanville appeared, the two
J3 Ladies retired; Miss Glanville asking
Arabella a hundred Questions concerning their
Diversion, the Drift of which was, to know
how Sir George behaved to her; But that fair

Lady, whose Thoughts were wholly employed
on the strange Accidents which had happened to
her that Day, longed to be at Liberty to indulge
her Refletions; and, complaining of extreme
Weariness, under Pretence of reposing herself
till Dinner, got quit of Miss Glanville's Company,
which, at that time, she thought very
tedious.

As soon as she was left to herself, her Imagination
running over all that had happened, sic
could not helpconfeffing, that few Women ever
met with such a Variety of Adventures in one
Day: In Danger of being carried off by Violence,
by one Lover; delivered by another;
Insinuations of Love from a Third, who, she
thought, was enamoured of her Cousin i and,
what was frill more surprising !a Discovery, that
her Uncle was not insensible of her Charms,
but was become the Rival of his own Son.

As extravagant as this Notion was, Arabella
found Precedents in her Romances of Passions
full as strange and unjustifiable; and confirmed
herself in that Opinion, by recollecting several
Examples of unlawful Love. Why should I
not believe, said she, that my Charms can
work as powerful Effecs as those of Olympia,
Princess of Thrace, whose Brother was passionately
enamoured of her?

Did not the Divine Cilia inspire Material
with a violent Passion for her, who, though
discovered to be her Brother, did not, nevertheless,
cease to adore her? And, to bring an
Instance still nearer to my own Case, was not
the Uncle of the fair ul4cyone in Love with her ?

And did he not endeavour to win her Heart by
all the Methods in his Power ?

Ah ! then, pursued file, let us doubt no
more of our Misfortune: And, since our fatal
Beauty has raised this impious Flame, let us
life it with our Rigour, and not allow an ill-timed
Pity, or Respect, to encourage a Passion
which may, one Day, cast a Blemish upon our
Glory. r

Arabella, having fettled this Point, proceeded
to reflet on the Conquest The had made of
Sir George: She examined his Words over andover,
and found them so exactly conformable to
the Language of an Oroondates or Orontes, that
she could not choose but be pleased: But, recollecting
that it behoved her, like all other Heroines,
to be extremely troubled and perplexed
at an Insinuation of Love, she began to lament
the cruel Necessity of parting with an agreeable
Friend; who, if he persisted in making her
acquainted with his Thoughts, would expose
himself to the Treatment Persons so indiscreet
always meet with; nor was she less concerned,
lest, if Mr. Glanville had not already dispatched
her Ravisher, Sir George, by wandering in
Search of him, and, haply, sacrificing him to
his eager Desire of serving her, should, by that
means, lay her under an Obligation to him,
which, considering him as a Lover, would be a
great Mortification

Sir George, however, was gone home to his
own House, with no Thoughts of pursuing
Arabella's Ravisher: And Mr. Glanville, being
questioned by his Father concerning his Quarrel,
invented some trifling Excuse for it; which

not agreeing with the Account the Baronet had
received from Arabella, he told his Son, that
he had concealed the Truth from him; and that
there was more in that Affair than he had
owned. You quarrelled, added he, upon Arabella's
Account; and she did not scruple to as-firm
it before all the Company.

Mr. Glanville, who had vainly flattered himself
with an Hope, that his Cousin had not acquainted
the Company with her whimsical Apprehensions,
was extremely vexed when he
found file had exposed herself to their Ridicule,
and that it was probable even he had not escaped:
But, willing to know from her monmouth how
far she had carried her Folly, he went up to
her Chamber; and, being immediately admitted,
The began to congratulate him upon the
Conquest he had gained, as she supposed, over
his Enemy; and thanked him very solemnly for
the Security he had procured for her.

Mr. Glanville, after assuring her, that she was
in no Danger of ever being carried away by that
Person whom she feared, proceeded to inquire
into all that had passed between her and the
Company whom The had joined, when the left
him; and Arabella, relating every Particular,
have him the Mortification to know, that her
*Folly had been sufficiently exposed: But else
touched upon her Fears for him with so much
Delicacy, and mentioned her Fainting in such
a manner, as insinuated a much greaterTender-
ness than he before had Reason to hope for;.
and this Knowlege destroying all his Intentions
to quarrel with her for what she had said, he
appeared so easy and satisfied, that Arabella,

reflecting upon the Misfortune his Father's newborn
Passion would probably be the Occasion of
to him, could not help sighing at the Apprehension;
looking on him, at the same time,
with a kind of pitying Complacency; which
did not escape Mr. Glanville's Notice.

I must know the Reason of that Sigh, Cousin,
said he, singling, and taking her Hand.

If you are wise, replied Arabella, gravely,
you will be contented to remain in the pleasing
Ignorance you are at present; and not seek to
know a thing which will, haply, afford you but
little Satisfation.

You have increased my Curiosity so much
by this Advice, resumed he, accommodating
his Looks to Arabella's, that I shall not be at
Rest till I know what it is you conceal from
me: And, since I am so much concerned in it,
even by your own Confession, I have a Right
to press you to explain yourself.

Since you are so importunate, replied Arabella,
I inst tell you, that I will not do you
lo great a Distinctness, as to explain myself;
nor will I be the first who Ihall acquaint you
with your Misfortune, since you will, haply,
too soon arrive at the Knowledge of it, by other
means.

Glanville, who imagined this was some new
Whim that had got into her Head, was but
little perplexed at an Insinuation, which, had
he been ignorant of her Foible, would have
given him great Uneasiness: But, being sensible
that she expected he would press her to disclose
herself, and appear extremely concerned at her
refusing him that Satisfaction, he counterfeited

so well, that she was at a loss how to evade the
Arguments he used to make her unfold the
terrible Mystery; when the Dinner-bell ringing,
and relieving her for the present, Mr. Glanville
led her down to the Parlour; where Sir Charles
and his Daughter attended their coming.

In which the Mistakes are notyet cleared up.

HE Baronet, who had been put into a
bad Humour by Arabella's Insinuations,
that Sir George had affronted her, appeared reserved
and uneasy; and, being resolved to
question her about it, was willing first to know
exactly what it was his Niece had been offended
at: But as he feared, if it came to his Son's
Knowlege, it would produce a Quarrel between
the young Gentlemen, that might have dangerous
Consequences, he was desirous of speaking
to her alone; and, as soon as Dinner was
over, asked her to take a Walk with him upon
the Terrace, telling her he had something to
say to her in private. Arabella, whose Fears
had been considerably increased by the Pensiveness
which appeared in her Uncle's Looks during
Dinner, and supposing he wanted a private
Conversation, only to explain himself more
clearly to her, than he had yet done, was excessively
alarmed at this Request; and, casting
her Eyes down to the Ground, blushed in such

a manner as betrayed her Confusion; and made
Miss Glanville and her Brother believe, that she
suffered her Uncle had a Design to press her
soon to give her Hand to Mr. Glanville, which
occasioned her apparent Disorder.

Sir Charles, however, who had not so heedfully
observed her Behaviour, repeated his Requefi;
adding, with a Smile, upon her giving
him no Answer, Sure, Lady Bella, you are
not afraid to be alone with your Uncle.

No, Sir, replied Arabella, giving him a
piercing Look; I am not afraid of being alone
with my Uncle; and, as long as he pretends to
be no more than my Uncle, I shall not scruple to
hear what he has to say tome.

Sir Charles, a little vexed at an Answer which
insinuated, as he thought, a Complaint of his
having pretended to more Authority over her
than he ought, told her, he hoped she had no
Cause to believe he would displease her, by any
improper Exertion of that Power over her, with
which her Father had intrusted him: For I assure
you, added he, I would rather you should follow
my Advice as an Uncle, than obey me as a Guardian;
and, since my Affection for you is, perhaps,
greater than what many People have fora
Niece, my Solicitude ought to be imputed to
that Motive.

I have all the Sense I ought to have of that
Affecion you honour me with, replied Arabella;
and since I hope it will be always what
:it should be, without wishing for its Increase, I
am contented with those Testimonies I have
already received of it; and do not desire any
other.

Sir Charles, a little puzlcd to understand the
Meaning of these Words, which the grave
Looks of Arabia made yet more mysterious,
rose from his Seat with an Air of Discontent: I
should have been glad to have spoken a Word in
private to you, Niece, said she; but, since you
think proper to make so much Ceremony in such
t Trifle, I'll defer it till you are in a better Humour.


Miss Glanville, seeing her Father going out
of the Room, stepped before him: Nay, Papa,
said she, if you want to speak with my Cousin,
my Brother and I will go out, and leave you to
yourselves.

You will do me a very great Displeasure, said
Arabella; for, I am sure, my Uncle has not
any thing of Consequence to say to me: however,
added she, seeing Miss Glanville go away,
I am resolved, I will not be left alone; and
therefore, Mr. Glanville, since I can pretend to
some Power over you, I command you to slay.

You may remember, Madam, said Mr. Glanville,
with a Smile, you refused to gratify my
Curiosity, with regard to something you hinted
to me some time ago; and, to punish you, added
he, going out of the Room, I am resolved you
shall life to what my Father has to say to you;
for, by your Unwillingness to hear it, I imagine
you suspect already what it is.

Arabella, finding she had no way to avoid
hearing what she dreaded so much, and observing
her Uncle had resumed his Chair, prepared
to give him Audience; but, in order to
deprive him of all Hope, that she would receive
his Discourse favourably, the assumed the severed

Look she was capable of; and, calling
her Eyes on the Ground, with a Mixture of
Anger and Shame, waited with a kind of Fear
and Impatience for what he had to say.

I see, Madam, said the Baronet, observing
Her Confusion, that you apprehend what I am
going to say to you; but, I beseech you, do not
fear 1 have any Intentions, but such as you'll
approve.

You are certainly in the right, Sir, said Arabella,
in the Interpretation you have put on my
Looks: I am really in Pain about the Purport
of your Discourse: And you would particularly
oblige me, if you would dispense with me
from hearing it.

I see, replied Sir Char-es, that, out of a mistaken
Fear, you are unwilling to hear me, in
order to avoid coming to the Explanation I de-fire:
But I tell you, once again, you have nothing
to apprehend.

I have every thing to apprehend, Sir, resumed
Arabella, tartly, while you persist in your Design
of disobliging me; and you cannot give mea
greater Proof of the Badness of your Intentions,
than by thus forcing me to listen to Discourses
I ought to avoid.

Since my Word has no Weight with you,
replied Sir Charles, I'll condescend to assure you,
by the most sacred Oath, That I do not mean
to come to any Extremities with Sir George,
concerning what you already told me: All I
desire to know is, If you think you had any Reason
to be offended with him for any thing he
said ? And, in that Case, I cannot dispense with
myself from expostulating with him about it.

'. 1
woUlli do me a Favour, Sir, refined
5?^i:'.rz, if v',u would into. cst yolr!cfi a little:;
ll wh!;t Sir Gc(,,'-c ,id to mie : he often
wa.is committed against mn only; and none
but rnyfelf has ani Right to rent it.

'Tis enough, Niece, laid Sir C,5I/,'s, rising:
You acknowledge sufficient to make me resolve
to oblige him to ask Pardon for the Affront you
:.t\'e received: However, I beg you may make
vo.iirlelf cess; no ill Cenfcqiienccs will happen
from this Affair, provided my Son does not
know it: And I know you have too much Discretion
to acquaint him with it.

Saying this, he went out of the Room, leaving
.arabella in great Confusion at what he hai
said; which, in her Opinion, had amounted
almost to a plain Declaration of his Passion; and
his Design of putting an End to Sir George's
Pretensions, whom, it was probable, he looked
upon as a more dangerous Rival than his Son,
confirmed her in the Opinion of his Resolution
to persecute her.

Full of the Reflections this Accident had occasioned,
fhc went to walk in the Garden,
where Mr. Glanville, his Sister having just left
him, joined her.

As he imagined, his Father's Design, in
speaking to her alone, was to prevail upon her
to consent to marry him before she left the Country,
which was what he most earnestly wished,
he drew a bad Omen from the Discontent which
appeared in her Eyes.

Is it with me, Cous, said he, or with what
my Father has been saying to you, that you are
angry ? Sith

With both, replied-Arai,'a, hastily; for if
you had said in theRoom,as I commanded you,
l hould not have been exposed to the Pain of
hearing Things so disagreeable.

Since I knew what would be the Purport of
my Father's Discourse, said Mr. Glanville, you
ought not to be surprised I could not resolve to
give any Interruption to it, by my Presence:
And, being so much interested in the Success
of his Solicitations, I could not choose but give
him an Opportunity of speaking to you alone,
as he desired.

It seems then, resumed Arabella, you know
what was the SubjeA of his Conversation.

I believe I can guess, interrupted Mr. Glanville,
smiling.

Is it possible, cried Arabella, starting back in
great Surprize, that, knowing, as you say you
do, your Father's Intentions, you would resolve
to furnish him with an Opportunity of
disclosing them?

Can you blame me, said Mr. Glanville, for
suffering him to undertake what I durst not myself?
I know your Delicacy, or rather your Severity,
so well, that I am sensible, if I had
taken the Liberty to say what my Father has
said, you would have been extremely offended;
and punished me, as you have often done, with
a Banishment from your Presence: Nay, pursued
he, seeing Astonishment and Anger in her
Countenance, I perceive you are, at this Moment,
going to pronounce some terrible Sentence
against me.

You are deceived, said Arabella, with a
forced Calmness I am so far from being offended

with you, that I am ready to acknowledge,
you merit very extraordinary Praises for
the persia Resignation you shew to the Will,
and, for your Credit, I will suppose, the Commands,
of your Father: But I would advise you
to be contented with the Reputation of being a
dutiful Son; and, for the future, never aspire
to that of being a faithful Lover.

Speaking these Words, which were wholly
unintelligible to her amazed Admirer, she left
him, and went to her own Apartment, strangely
surprised at the Indifference of Mr. Glanville;
who, as file understood what he had said, was
not only willing to resign her to his Father,
but also took upon him to mediate in his behalf.


As the was unwilling to acknowlege, even to
herself, that the Grief she felt at this Discovery,
proceeded from any Affecion for her Cousin,
the imputed it to the Shame of seeing herself Co
barely forsaken and neglected; and, not being
able to find a Precedent for such an Indignity
offered to the Charms of any Lady in her Romances,
the Singularity of her Fate, in this
respect, seemed to demand all her Uneasiness.


CH A P. VIII.
which contains same necessary Consequences

of the foregoing Miftakes.-A Soliloquy
on a Love-letter.
W ~ HILE Arablla passed her Time in
Vt; her Closet, in the most disagreeable
Reflections, Glanville was racking his Brain to
find out the Meaning of thofemyfterious Words
the had uttered at leaving him He examined
them twenty times over, but could not possibly
penetrate into their Sense: But, tfppofing-
at last, that they really meant nothing at all,
or were occasioned by some new Flight of her
Imagination, he went to find out his Father,
in order to know what had passed between
him and Arabella.

Sir Charles, however, was not to be found; he
had ordered his Horse to be made ready, under
Pretence of taking a little Ride after Dinner;
and, passing by Sir George's House, alighted to
pay him a Visit.

The young Baronet, being at home, received
him with great Politeness: And Sir Charles,
whose peculiar Disposition was, to be nicely tenacious
of every thing which, he imagined,
had any Relation to the Honour of his Family,
took the first Opportunity to question him, concerning
the Confusion his Whisper had occasioned
in Lady Bella; adding, That she had
confessed, he had given her Reason to take ill
what he had said to her.

Sir Gc:osA, wo w was by no means willing to
quarrel with the Uncle of Yi'-lciv/a, received the
old Gentleman's Remonstrances with a great
deal of Calmness; and, finding ZIrahlcla had
not discovered the Purport of that Whisper
which had offended her, he told Sir Cbarles,
That the Confusion he saw in her Countenance,
was occasioned by his rallying her upon the
Fright she had been in upon Mr. Glanville's
Account: He added some Particulars to this
Account, that intirely taking away all Inclination
in Sir Charles to pursue the Matter any
farther, they' parted upon very good Terms;
Sir George promising, very soon, to return his
Visit at the Cashiers

Glanville, upon his Father's Return, being
impatient to know what he had said to Arabella,
inquired with so much Precipitation, concerning
the Conversation they had had together,
that Sir Charles, unwilling to tell him the Truth,
and not having time to consider of an Answer,
evaded his Question in such a manner, that Mr.
Glanville could not help making force Observation
upon it; and, comparing this circumstance
with what Arabella had said, tho' he
could not comprehend the Meaning that seemed
to be concealed under their Behaviour, he immediately
concluded, there was some Mystery,
which it concerned him to find out.

PosSessed with this Opinion, he longed for
all Opportunity to talk with Arabella alone;
but he was not so happy to obtain one; for,
tho' that Fair-one presided at the Tea-table, as
usual, and also appeared at Supper, yet Ihe so
industriously avoided all Occasions of being alone

with him, tho' but for a Moment, and appeared
so reserved and uneasy, that it was impossible
for him to speak to her upon that subject.


As Soon as it was time to retire, having resolved
to request the Favour of a few Moments
Conversation with her, in her own Apartment;
and when he had, as was his Custom, handed
her up Stairs; instead of wishing her a good
Night, at her Chamber-door, he was going
to desire Permission to enter it with her; when
Lucy, coming to meet her Lady, whispered her
in the Ear; upon which, Arabella, turning
towards him, gave him an hasty Salute, and
hurried into her Apartment.

Glanville, no lets vexed at this disappointment,
than perplexed at that Whisper, which
had caused such a visible Emotion in Arabella,
retired to his ownRoom, tormented with a thousand
uneasy Suspicions, for which he could not
exaaly assign a Cause ; and wishing impatiently
for the next Day, in which he hoped to procure
some Explanation of what at present greatly
perplexed him.

In the mean time, Arabella, who had been
informed by Lucy, in that Whisper, who was
eager to let her know it, that a Messenger had
brought a Letter from Sir George, and, late as
it was at Night, waited for an Answer, was debating
with herself, whether she should open
this Billet or not: She had a firing Inclination
to see what it contained; but, fearful of transgressing
the Laws of Romance, by indulging a
Curiosity not justifiable by Example, she resolved
to return this Letter unopened.

Here, said she to Lucy, give this Letter to the
Messenger that brought it, and tell him, I was
excessively offended with you, for receiving it
from his Hands.

Lucy, taking the Letter, was going to obey
her Orders; when, recollecting herself,. the bid
her slay.

Since Sir George, said the to herself, is no
declared Lover of mine, I may, without any
Offence to Decorum, see what this Letter contains:
To refuse receiving it, will be to acknowlege,
that his Sentiments are not unknown tome;
and, by consequence, to lay myself under a
Necessity banishing him: Nor is it fit, that I
should allow him to believe, I am so ready to
apprehend the Meaning of every gallant Speech,
which is used to me; and to construe such insinuations,
as he took the Liberty to make me,
into Declarations of Love.

Allowing, therefore, the Justice of these Reasons,
she took the Letter out of Lucy's Hand;
and, being upon the Point of opening it, a sudden
Thought controuled her Designs: She threw
it suddenly upon her Toilet; and, looking very
earnestly upon it,

Presumptuous Paper! said she, speaking with
great Emotion to the Letter: Bold Repository
of thy Master's daring Thoughts ! Shall I not
be blamed by all, who hereafter will hear, or
read, my History, if, contrary to the Apprehensions
I have, that thou contained a Confession
that will displease me, I open thy Seal,
and become accessary to thy Writer's Guilt,
by deigning to make myself acquainted with it ?
And thou, too indiscreet and unwary Friend,

VOL. I. N whose

whole Folds contain the Acknowlegement of
his Crime! What will it advantage thee or
him, if, torn by my resenting Hand, I make
thee differ, for the Part thou bearers in thy
M/lailer's Fault; and teach him, by thy Fate,
how little Kindness he has to expect from me !
Yet, to spare myself the Trouble of reading
what will, questionless, greatly displease me, I
will return thee, uninjured, into thy Master's
Hands; and, by that Moderation, make him
repent the Presumption he has been guilty of!

Containing a Love-letter in the Heroic

Stile; with same occasional Reasonings
by Lucy, full of Wit and Simplicity.
O UR fair Heroine, having ended the foregoing

Soliloquy, took up the Letter, and
gave it to Lucy, who had, all the time she was
speaking, observed a profound Silence, mixed
with a most eager Attention.

Here, pursued fne, carry it to the Person who
brought it; and bid him tell his Master, that,
-left I should find any thing in it, which may
offend me, I have chosen not to read it: And,
if he is wise, he will profit by my Concern for
him, and take care how he hazards displeasing
me a Second time by an Importunity of this
kind, which I Ihall not so easily pardon him.

Lucy, who had taken particular Notice of
this Speech, in order to remember everyWord

of it, when she repeated it again, went conning
her Lesson to the Place where she had desired
the Servant to wait her coming: But he was
gone; such being indeed his Matter's Orders;
for he was apprehensive, that, following the
Custom of the Ladies in Romances, Arabella
would return his Letter; and therefore, to deprive
her of an Opportunity of sending it back
that Night, he ordered his Man to say, he
waited for an Answer; but, as soon as he conveniently
could, to come away without one.

Lucy, in a great Surprize at the Servant's going
away, returned to her Lady with the Letter
in her Hand, telling her fie muff needs read it
now, since the Person, who brought it, was.
gone.

It muss be confessed, said Arabella, taking
the Letter from her, with a Smile, he has fallen
upon an ingenious Device, to make me keep it
for this Night; and, since, haply, I may be
mistaken in the Contents, I have a mind to,
open it.

Lucy did not fail to confirm her Lady in this
Design: And Arabella, making as if shielded
to the Importunities of her Confidante, opened
the Letter; which she found as follows:
The unfortunate and' despairing Bellmour, to

the Divine Arabella.
Madam, Once it is, doubtless, not only with your
Permission, but even by your Commands,
that your Uncle, Sir Charls Glanville, comes
to pronounce the Sentence of my Death, in the

N z De-denunciation

of your Anger, I submit, Madam,
without repining at the Rigour of that Doom
you have inflicted on me. Yes, Madam, this
Criminal, who has dared to adore you, with
the most sublime and perfect Passion that ever
was, acknowleges the Justice of his Punishment;
and, dulce it is impossible to cease loving you,
or to live without telling you he does so, he is
going, voluntarily, to run upon that Death your
Severity makes him wish for, and the Greatness
of his Crime demands. Let my Death.
then, O Divine Arabella, expiate the Offence
I have been guilty of! And let me hope those
fair Eyes, that have beheld me with Scorn
when alive, will not refuse to shed some Tears
upon my Tomb ! And that, when you remember
my Crime of loving you, you will also be
pleated to remember, that I died for that Crime;
and with for no other Comfort in Death, but
the Hope of your not hating, when he is no
more,

The unhappy Bellmour.
Arabella, who had read this Letter aloud,
sighed gently at the Conclusion of it; but poor
Lucy, who was greatly affected at So dolorous
an Epistle, could not restrain her Tears; but
sobbed so often, and with so much Violence,
as, at length, recalled her Lady from the Reverie,
into which she was plunged.

What ails you? said she to her Confidante,
greatly surprised: What is the Cause of this unseemly
Sorrow?

Oh ! Madam! cried Lucy, her Sobs making
a frequent and unpleasing Interruption in her

Words; I stall break my Heart to be sure: Never
was such a sad mournful Letter in the
World: I could cry my Eyes out for the poor
Gentleman. Pray excuse me, Madam; but,
indeed, I can't help saying, You are the most
hard-heartiest Lady I ever knew in my born
Days: Why, to be sure, you don't care, if
an hundred fine Gentlemen should die for you,
tho' their Spirits were to haunt you every Night!
Well! I would not have what your Ladyship
has to answer for, for all the World !

You are a foolish Wench! replied Arabella,
smiling at her Simplicity: Do you think I have
any Cause to accuse myself, tho' Five thousand
Men were to die for me ? 'Tis very certain, my
Beauty has produced very deplorable Effeas:
The unhappy Hervey has expiated, by his
Death, the Violence his too desperate Passion
forced him to meditate against me: The no less
guilty, the noble unknown edward, is wandering
about the World, in a tormenting Despair;
and finds exposed to the Vengeance of my
Cousin, who has vowed his Death. My Charms
have made another Person, whose Charater
ought to be sacred to me, forget all the Ties
of Consanguinity; and become the Rival of his
Son, whose Interest he once endeavoured to
support: And, lately, the unfortunate Bell-your
consumes away in an hopeless Passion;
and, conscious of his Crime, dooms himself,
haply, with more Severity than I defile, to a
voluntary Death; in hopes, thereby, of procuring
my Pardon and Compassion, when he is
no more. All these, Lucy, as I said before,
are very deplorable Eftfts of my Beauty; but

you muss observe, that my Will has no Part
in the Miseries, that unfortunate Beauty occasions;
and that, tho' I could even with myself
less fair, in order to avoid giving so much Unhappiness
to others, yet these Wishes would
not avail; and since, by a fatal Necessity, all
these Things will happen, whether I would or
no, I must comfort myself under the Uneasiness,
which the Sensibility of my Temper
makes me feel, by the Reflection, that, with my
own Consent, I contribute nothing to the Misfortune
of those whole me.

Will your Ladyship then let poor Sir George
die? said Lucy, who had listened very attentively
to this fine Harangue, without understanding
what it meant.

Questionless, he must die, replied Arabella,
if he permits in his Design of loving me.

But, pray, Madam, resumed Lucy, cannot
your Ladyship command him to live, as you
did Mr. Hervey, and Mr. Glanville, who both
did as you bid them?

I may command him to live, laid Arabella;
and there is no Question but he would
obey me, if I likewise permit him to love me;
but, this last not being fit for me to do, I see
no way to prevent the sad Resolution he has
taken.

To be lure, Madam, returned Lucy, your
Ladyship knows what you ought to do better
than I can advise your Ladyflip, being that
you are more learned than me: But, for all
thai, 'i ,.; it's ?letter to save Life than to kill,
as the B;.,!e Book says; and, since I am lure
your Ladyship is a good Christian, if the Gentleman

dies for the Want of a few kind Words,
or so, I am sure you will be troubled in Mind
about it.

It mush be confessed, said Arabella, smiling,
that, tho' your Solicitations are not very eloquent,
they are very earnest and affecting; and
I promise you, I will think about it; and, if I
can persuade myself, I am doing no wrong
Thing, by concerning myself about his preservation,
I will dispatch you To-morrow Morning,
with my Orders to him, to live, or, at
least, to proceed no further in his Design of dying,
till he has further Cause.

Lucy, being extremely glad she had gained
her Point, called in her Lady's other Women,
who, having assisted her to undress, left her in
her Closet, to which she always retired for an
Hour, before she went to Bed.

THE
Female Qu i xo T E.

A4 Dispute very learnedly handled by two

Ladies, in which the Reader may take
what Part he pleases.

R. Glanville, who was too much
in Love to pats the Night with
M any great Degree of Tranquillity,
-; X under the Apprehensions he felt;

it being the Nature of that Passion,
to magnify the most inconsiderable
Trifles into Things of the greatest Importance,
when they concern the beloved
; did not fail to torment himself with
a thousand different Fears, which the Irv!eri-

VOL. II. B oC,

vous Behaviour of his Father, and the more
myfieriousWords of his Mistress, gave Rise to,
Among many various Conjectures, all equally
unreasonable, he fixed upon one, no way advantageous
to Sir Charles; for, supposing that
the Folly of Arabella had really disgusted him,
and made him desirous of breaking off the designed
Match between them; lie was, as he
thought, taking Measures to bring this about,
knowing, that if Lady Bella refused to fulfil
her Father's Desire in this Particular, a very
considerable Estate would descend to him.

Upon any other Occasion, Mr. Glanville
would not have suspected his Father of so ungenerous
an Ation ; but Lovers think everything
possible, which they fear; and being prepossessed
with this Opinion, he resolved the
next Morning to found his Father's Inclinations,
by intreating him to endeavour to prevail
upon Lady Bella to marry him before her
Year of Mourning for the Marquis was expired.


Attending him, therefore, at Breakfast, in
his own Chamber, he made his designed Request,
not without heedfully observing his
Countenance at the same time ; and trembling,
Jest he should make him an Answer, that
might confirm his uneasy Suspicion.

Sir Charles, however, agreeably surprised
him, by promising to comply with his Desire
that Day ; for, added he, tho' my Niece has
some odd ways, yet, upon the Whole, the is a.
very accomplished Woman; and when you
are her Husband, you may probably find the
Means of curing het of those little Follies,

which at present are conspicuous enough; but
being occasioned by a Country Education, and
a perfect Ignorance of the World, the In-fruition,
which then you will not scruple to
give her, and which, from a Husband, without
any Offence to her Delicacy, she may
receive, may reform her Conduct; and make
her Behaviour as complete, as, it mute be
confessed, both her Person and Mind now
.are.

Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice
of this Remark, as soon as Breakfast was
over, went to visit the two Ladies, who generally
drank their Chocolate together.

Miss Glanville being then in Lady Bella's
Apartment, he was immediately admitted,
where he found them engaged in a high Dispute
; and, much against his Will, was obliged
to be Arbitrator in the Affair, they having, upon
his Entrance, both appealed to him.

But, in order to place this momentous As-fair
in a true Light, 'tis necessary to go back a
little, and acquaint the Reader with what had
passed in the Apartment; and also, following
the Custom of the Romance and Novel-writers,
in the Heart, of our Heroine.

No sooner were her fair Eyes open in the
Morning, than the unfortunate Sir George presenting
himself her Imagination, her Thoughts
to use Scudery's Phrase, were at a cruel War with
each other: She wished to prevent the Death
of this obsequious Lover; but file could not resolve
to preserve his Life, by giving him that
Hope he required; and without which, fine

B 2 fircsC

feared, it would be impossible for him to
live.

After pondering a few Hours upon the necessity
of his Case, and what a just Regard to
her own Honour required of her, Decorum
prevailed so much over Compassion, that she
resolved to abandon the miserable Sir George
to all the Rigour of his Destiny; when, happily
for the disconsolate Lover, the History of
the fair Amalazotha coming into her Mind,
fie remembred, that this haughty Princess,
having refused to marry the Person, her Father
recommended to her, because he had nota
Crown upon his Head; nevertheless, when he
v-as dying for Love of her, condescended to
visit him, and even to give him a little Hope,
in order to preserve his Life: See conceived i!
.could be no l5emiih to her Character, if file
followed the Example of this most glorious
Princess; and suffered herself to relax a little in
her Severity, to prevent the Effects of her Lover's
Despair.

Fear not, Arabella, said She toberfelf; fear
not to obey the Dictates of thy Compassion,
since the glorious A4malazontha justifies, by her
Example, the Means thou wilt use to preserve
a noble Life, which depends upon a few Words
thou shalt utter.

When (Mb had taken this Resolution, flie
rung her Bell for her Women ; and as soon a>
the was defied, the defined them all but Lucy,
whom she ordered to bring her Paper and Pens,
telling her, she would write an Answer to Sir
G1e,¬ære's Letter.

time she had brought her Lady all the Marte
rials for Writing, her Mind was changed ; she
having reflected, that l,znalazonthli, whose Example,
in order to avoid the Censure of fututr
Ages, she was resolved exactly to follow, did
not write to Ambiomer, but paid him a Visit,
she resolved to do the like ; and therefore bid
Lucy take them-away again, telling her: She
had thought better of it, and would not wit',
to him.

Lucy, extremely concerned at this Resolution;,
obeyed her very slowly, and with great seeming
Regret,

I perceive, said .arabella, you are afraid, I
shall abandon the unfortunate Man you solicit
for, to the Violence of his Despair ; ibi'
tho' I do not intend to write to him, yet I'll
make use of a Method, perhaps as effectual;
for, to speak truly, I mean to make him a Visit;
itr by this time his Fever is, I suppose, violent
enough to make him keep his Bed.

And will you be so good, Madam, said
Lucy, to go and see the poor Gentleman? I
warrant you, he will be ready to die for Joy,
when he sees you.

There mutt be proper Precautions used, said
Arabella, to prevent those Consequences, which
the sudden and unexpected Sight of me may
produce. Those about him, I suppose, will have
Discretion enough for that: Therefore give Orders
for the Coach to be made ready, and tell
my Women, they must attend me; and be
sure you give them Directions, when I enter
Sir George's Chamber, to stay at .a convenient
Distance! , mII order to leave ne an Opportunity

1 3 cf

Of speaking to him, without being heard: As
for you, you may approach the Bed-side with
me; since, being my Confident, you may hear
all we have to say.

Arabella, having thus fettled the Ceremonial
of her Visit, according to the Rules prescribed
by Romances, sat down to her Tea-table,
having lent to know, if Miss Glanville was up,
and received for Answer, that she would attend
her at Breakfast.
Arabella, who had at first determined to
say nothing of this Affair to her Cousin, could
'iot resist the Desire tile had of talking upon a
Subject so interesting ; and, telling her with a
Smile, that flie was about .to make a very
:charitable Visit that Morning, asked her, if
the was disposed to bear her Company in it.

1 know you Country Ladies; said Miss
Glanville, are very fond of visiting your sick
Neighbours: For my Part, I do not love such
a grave kind of Amusement; yet, for the sake
of the Airing, I shall be very willing to attend
ou I think, said Arabella, with a more serious
Air than before, it behoves every generous Person
to compassionate the Misfortunes of their
Acquaintance and Friends, and to relieve them
as far as lies in their Power; but those Miseries
we ourselves occasion to others, demand, in a
more particular Manner, our Pity; and, inconsistent
with Honour, our Relief.

And pray, returned Miss Glanville, who is
it you have done any Mischief to, which you
are to repair by this charitable Visit, as you
call it?

The Mischief I have done, replied Arabella,
blushing, and calling down her Eyes, was not
voluntary, I assure you: Yet I will not fcfple
to repair it, if I can ;. tho', since my Power ia
confined by certain unavoidable Laws, my Endeavours
may not haply have all the Success 1
could with.

Well, but, dear Cousin, interrupted Miss
Glanville, tell me in plain E-igl/i7, what this
Mischief is, which you have done; and to what
Purpose you are going out this Morning ?

I am going to pay a Visit to Sir George Bell-your,
replied Arabella; and I intreat you, fail
Cousin, to pardon me for robbing you of lI
accomplished a Lover. I really always thought
he was in Love with you, till I was undeceived
by some Words he spoke Yesterday; and
a Letter 1 received from him last Night, in
which he has been bold enough to declare hi
Passion to meant through the Apprehensions
of my Anger, is this Moment dying with
Grief; and 'tis to reconcile him to Life, that
I have prevailed upon myself to make him a
Visit; in which charitable Design, as I said
before, I should be glad of your Company.

Miss G!.anviiie, who believed not a Word
Lady Bella had said, burst out a laughing, at :
Speech, that appeared to her so extremely falls
and ridiculous.

I see, said Arabella, you are of a Humour
to divert yourself with the Miseries of a despairing
Lover ; nd in this Particular, you
greatly resemble the fair and witty Dorallfr,
who always felled at such Maladies as are occasioned
by Love: However, this Insensibility

B 4 does

does not become you so well as her, since
all her Condut was conformable to it, no Marr
in the World being bold enough to talk to her
of Love ; but you, Cousin, are ready, even by
your own Confession, to listen to such Discourses
from any body ; and therefore this Behaviour,
in you, may be with more Justice
termed Levity, than Indifference.

I perceive, Cousin, said Miss Glanville, I
have always the worst of those Comparisons
you are pleased to make between me and other
People; but, I assure you, as shee and indiscreet
as you think me, I should very mucli-
scruple to visit a Man, upon any Occasion
whatever.

I am quite astonished, Miss Glanville, resumed
Arabella, to hear you assume a Character
of so much Severity; you, who have
granted Favours of a Kind in a very great. Degree
criminal.

Favours ! interrupted Miss Glanville, criminal
Favours ! Pray explain yourself, Madam.

Yes, Cousin, said Arabella, I repeat it again;
criminal Favours, such as allowing Persons to
talk to you of Love ; not forbidding them to
write to you; giving them Opportunities of
being alone with you for several Moments together;
and several other Civilities of the like
Nature, which no Man can possibly merit, under
many Years Services, Fidelity, and Pains:
All there are criminal Favours, and highly blameable
in a Lady, who has any Regard for her
Reputation.

All these, replied Miss Glanville, are nothing,
in Cuiiiparilbn of making them Visits. and.

no Woman, who has any Reputation at all,
will be guilty of taking such Liberties.

What! Mils, replied, la,!ella, will you
dare, by this Insinuation, to cat any Censures
upon the Virtue of the divine Mandana, the
haughty Analazontha, the fair Statira, the cold
and rigid PariJatis, and many other illustrious.
Ladies, who did not scruple to visit their Lovers,
when confined to their Beds, either by
the Wounds they received in Battle, or the
more cruel and dangerous ones they suffered
from their Eyes These chaste Ladies, who never,
granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover,.
till he was upon the Point of being their Husband,
would nevertheless most charitably condescend
to approach their Bed-side, and speak
fume compassionate Words to them, in order
to promote their Cute, and make them fubinti
to live; nay, these divine Beauties would net
refute to grant the same Favour to Persons
whom they did not loveth prevent the fatal
Consequences of their Despairs

Lord, Madam! interrupted Miss Glanville,
I wonder you can talk so blasphemously, to calla
Parcel of confident Creatures divine, and
such terrible Words.

Do you know, Miss, said arabella,. with a.
fern Look, that 'tis of the greatest Principes
that ever were, whom you speak in this irreverent
Manner ? Is. it possible, that you can be
ignorant of the sublime Quality of Alandana,.
who was the Heiress of Two powerful Kingdoms
? Are you not sensible, that Ainalazontha
was Queen of Thuringia ? And will you prey

5. tend

tend to deny the glorious Extraction of Statira
and Parifatis, Princesses of Persia ?

I shall not trouble myself to deny any thing
about them, Madam, said Miss Glanville; for
I never heard of them before ; and really I do
not choose to be always talking of Queens and
Princesses, as if I thought none but such great
People were worthy my Notice: It looks so
affected, I should imagine every one laughed
at me, that heard me.

Since you are so very scrupulous, returned
arabella, thatyou dare not imitate the Sublimest
among Mortals, I can furnish you with many
Examples, from the Condut of Persons, whose
Quality was not much superior to yours, which
may reconcile you to an Action, you at present,
with so little Reason, condemn : And, to name
but One among some Thousands, the fair Cleg-nice,
the most rigid and austere Beauty in all Sardis,
paid several Visits to the passionate Ligda-
nis, when his Melancholy, at the ill Success of
his Passion, threw him into a Fever, that confined
him to his Bed.

And pray, Madam, who was that Leonine ?
faidMifs Glanville; and where did the live ?

In Sardis, I tall you, said Arabella, in the
Kingdom of Lydia.

Oh! then it is not in our Kingdom, said
Miss Glanville: What signifies what Foreigners
do ? I shall never form my Condut, upon the
Example of Outlandish People; what is common
enough in their Countries, would be very
particular here; and you can never persuade me,
that it is seemly for Ladies to pay Visits to
Men in their Bds.

A Lady, said Arabella, extremely angry at
her Cousin's Obstinacy, who will sussex Men
to press her Hand, write to her, and talk to
her of Love, ought to be ashamed of such an
affected Niceness, as that you pretend to,

I insist upon it, Madam, said Miss Glanville,
that all those innocent Liberties you rail
at, may be taken by any Woman, without
giving the World room to censure her: but,
without being very bold and impudent, she
cannot go to see Men in their Beds; a Freedom
that only becomes a Sister, or near Relation.


So then, replied Arabella, reddening with
Vexation, you will persist in affirming the divine
Mandana was impudent ?

If she paid such indiscreet Visits as those, fls
was, said Mils Glanville.

Oh Heavens! cried Arabella, have 1 lived
to hear the most illustrious Princess, that ever
was in the World, so shamefully replied
on ?

Bless me, Madam! said Miss Glanvidl, what
Reason have you to defend the Character ot
this Princess so much ? She will hardly thank.
you for your Pains, I fansy.

Were you acquainted with the Charater of
that most generous Princess, said Arabella, you
would be convinced, that the was sensible of
the smallest Benefits; but it is not with a View
of acquiring her Favour, that I defend her
against your inhuman Aspersions, since it is
more than Two thousand Years since she died;
yet common Justice obliges me to vindicate a
Person so illustrious for her Birth and Virtue;

B 6 and

and were you not my Cousin, I should express
my Resentment in another Manner, for the
Injury you do her.

Truly, fetid Miss Glanville, I am not much
obliged to you Madam, for not downright
quarrelling with me for one that has been in
her Grave Two thousand Years: However,
nothing shall make me change my Opinion,
:nd I am sure molt People will be of my Side
of ile Argument.

That Moment Mr. Glanville sending for
Permission to wait upon Arabella, (he ordered
him to be admitted, telling Miss Glanville, the

'To which she connected.

A rabies, when he entered the Room, to
be Judge of a great Controversy between Miss
Glanville and myself. I beseech you therefore,
let us have your Opinion upon the Matter,

Miss Glanville maintains, that it is less criminal
in a Lady to hear Persons talk to her of
Love, allow them to kiss her Hand, and permit
them to write to her, than to make a charitable.
\'dit to a Man who is confined to his Best

through the Violence of his Passion and despair
the Intent of this Visit being only to prevent
the Death of an unfortunate Lover, and,
if necessary, to lay her Commands upon. him
to live.

And this latter is your Opinion, is it not
Madam ? said Mr. Glanville.

Certainly, Sir, replied isabella, and in this I
am justified by all the Heroines of Antiquity.

I'hen you must be in the Right, Madam, returned
Mr. Glanville, both because your own
Judgment tells you so, and also the Example
of these Heroines you mention.

Well, Madam, interrupted Miss Glanville
Ihafily, since my Brother has given Sentence on
your Side, I hope you will not delay your Visit
to Sir George any longer,

How ! said Mr. Glanville, surprised, is Lady
Bella going to visit Sir George ? Pray, Madam,
may I presume to-inquire the Reason for your
doing him this extraordinary Favour ?

You are not very wise, said Arabella, looking
gravely upon Miss Glanville, to discover a
Thing, which may haply create a Quarrel between
your Brother, and the unfortunate Person
you speak of: Yet since this Indiscretion
cannot be recalled, we must endeavour to prevent
the Consequences of itt.

I assure you, Madam, interrupted Mr. Glanville,
extremely impatient to know the Meaning
of these Hints, you have nothing to fear
from me: Therefore you need not think yourself
under any Necessity of concealing this Affair
from me,

You are not, haply, so moderate as you pretend,
said Arabella, (who would not have been
displeased to have seen him in all the jealous
Transports of an enraged Orontes) ; but whatever
ensues, I can no longer keep from your
Knowlege, a Truth your Sister has begun to
discover; but, in telling you what you desire to
know, I expect you will suppress all Inclinations
to Revenge, and truss the Care of your Interest
to my Generosity.

You are to know then, that in the Person of
your Friend Sir George, you have a Rival,
haply the more to be feared, as his Passion is
no less respectful than violent: I possibly tell
you more than I ought, pursued she, blushing,
and casting down her Eyes, when I confess,
that for certain Considerations, wherein perhaps
you unconcerned, I have received the first Insinuation
of this Passion with Disdain enough ;
and I assure myself, that you are too generous
to desire any Revenge upon a miserable Rival,.
of whom Death is going to free you;

Then, taking Sir George's Letter out of her
Cabinet, she presented it to Mr. Glanville.

Read this, added she; but read it without
suffering yourself to be transported with any
violent Motions of Anger: And as in Sight, I
:m persuaded you would not oppress a fallen
and vanquished Foe; so in Love, I may hope,
an unfortunate Rival will merit your Compassion.


Never doubt it, Madam, replied Mr. Glanville
receiving the Letter, which Miss Glanville,
with a beating Heart, earnestly desired to hear
read. 'Her Brother, after asking Permission of

Arabella, prepared to gratify her Curiosity ; but
he no sooner read the first Sentence, than,
notwithstanding all his Endeavours, a Smile appeared
in his Face ; and MifsGlanville, less able,
and indeed less concerned to restrain her Mirth
at the uncommon Stile, burst out a laughing,
with so much Violence, as obliged her Brother
to flop, and counterfeit a terrible Fit of Coughing,
in order to avoid giving Arabella the like
Offence.

The Astonishment of this Lady, at the surprising
and unexpected Effect her Lover's Letter
produced on Miss Glanville, kept her in a
profound Silence, her Eyes wandering from the
Sister to the Brother; who, continuing his
Cough, was not able, for some Moments, to
go on. with his Reading.

Arabella, during this Interval, having recovered
herself a little, asked Miss Glanville, if
fie found any thing in a Lover's Despair,
capable of diverting her so much, as she seemed
to be with that of the unfortunate Sir George ?

My Sister, Madam, said Mr. Glanville,
preventing her Reply, knows so many of Sir
George's Infidelities, that she cannot persuade
herself he is really in such a dangerous Way
as he insinuates: Therefore you ought not to be
'surprised, if she is rather disposed to laugh at
this Epistle, than to be moved with any Concern
for the Writer, who, though he is my Rival,
I must say, appears to be in a deplorable
Condition.

Pray, Sir, resumed Arabella, a little compost
by those Words, finish the Letter: Your

Sister may possibly find more Cause for Pity
than Contempt, in the latter Part of it.

Mr. Glanville, giving a Look to 'his Sister,
sufficient to make her comprehend, that he
would have her restrain her Mirth for the future,
proceeded in his Reading; but every Line increasing
his strong Inclination to laugh when
he came to the pathetic Wish, that her fair
Eyes might shed some Tears upon. his Tomb,
no longer able to keep his assumed Gravity
he threw down the Letter in a counterfeited.
Rage.

Curse the stupid Fellow! cried he, is he mad,
to call the finest Black Eyes in the Universe,.
fair. Ah ! Cousin, saide to Arabella, hemut
be little acquainted with the Influence of your
Eyes, since he can so egregiously mistake their
Colour.

And it is very plain, replied Arabella, that
you are little acquainted with the sublime Language
in which he writes, since you find Fault
within Epithet, which marks the Beauty, not
the Colour, of those Eyes he praises ; for, in
fine, Fair is indifferently applied, as well to.
Black and Brown Eyes, as to Light and Blue
ones, when they are either really lovely in.
themselves, or by the Lover's Imagination
created so: And therefore, since Sir George's
Prepossession has made him see Charms in my
Eves, which questionless are not there; by
calling them fair, he has very happily expressed
himself, since therein he has the Sanction of
those great Historians, who wrote the Histories
of Lovers he seems to imitate, as well. in. his
AEtions as Stile.

I find my Rival is very happy in your Opinion,
Madam, said Mr. Glanville; and I am
apt to believe, 1 shall have more Reason to
envy than pity his Situation.

If ybu keep within the Bounds I prescribe
you, replied Arabella, you shall have no Reason
to envy his Situation ; but, considering the
Condition to which his Despair has by this Time
certainly reduced him, Humanity requires that
we should take some Care of him ; and, to
shew you how great my Opinion of your generosity
is, I will even intreat you to accompany
me in the Visit I am going to make him.

Mr. Glanville, being determined, if possible,
to prevent her exposing herself, affected to be
extremely moved at this Request; and, rising
from his Chair in great seeming Agitation, traversed
the Room for some Moments, without
speaking a Word : Then suddenly flopping;

And can you, Madam, said he, looking
upon Arabella, suppose, that I will consent to
your visiting my Rival , and that Swill be mean
enough to attend you myself to his House ? Do
you think, that Orontes you have often reproached
me with, would aa in such a
Manner ?

I don't know how Orontes would have aced
in this Case, said Arabella. because it never
happened that such a Proof of his Submission
was ever desired of him; but, considering that
he was of a very fiery and jealous Disposition,
it is probable he might ac as you do.

1 always understood, Madam, said Mr Glanville,
that Orontes was a Favourite of yours,
but it seems 1 was mistaken

You will be very unjust, said Arabella, to
draw any unfavourable Conclusion frron what
I have 'aid, to the Prejudice of that valiant
Prince, for whom I confess I have a great Esteem;
and truly whoever reflect upon the
great Actions he did in the Wars between the
Amazons and the fierce Naobarzanes King of
the Cilicia, must needs conceive a very high
Idea of his Virtue; but if I cannot bring the
Example of Orontes to influence you in the present
Case, I can mention those of other Persons,
no less illustrious for their Birth and Courage,
than him. Did not the brave Venison,
when his Rival Oxyatres was sick, intreat the
beautiful Barking to favour him with a Visit
And the complaisant Husband of the divine Pa-rifts
was not contented with barely desiring
her to visit Lysimachus, who was dying with
Despair at her Marriage, but would many
times bring her himself to the Bed-side of this
unfortunate Lover, and, leaving her there, give
him an Opportunity of telling her what he
suffered for her sake.

1 am afraid, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, I
Shall never be capable of imitating either the
brave Memnon, nor the complaisant Lysimachus,
in this Case, and the Humour of Orontes seems
to me the most commendable.

Nevertheless, said Arabella, the Humour of
Orontes cost him an infinite Number of Pains;
and it may happen, you will as near resemble
him in his Fortune as you do in his Disposition:
But pray let us end this Dispute at present.
If you are not generous enough to visit an unfortunate
Rival, you shall not put a Flop to

the Charity of my Intentions ; and since Miss
Glanville is all of a sudden become so severe,
that file will not accompany me in this Visit,
I shall be contented with the Attendance of
my Women.

Saying this, she rose from her Seat, calling
Lucy, and ordered her to bid her Companions
attend.

Mr. Glanville, seeing her thus determined,
was almost mad with Vexation.

Upon my Soul, Madam, said he, seizing
her Hand, you must not go.

How, Sir! said Arabella, sternly.
Not without seeing me die first, resumed hein
a languishing Tone.

You must not die, replied Arabella, a little
softened, nor must you pretend to hinder me
from going.

Nay, Madam, said Glanville, one of there
two Things will certainly happen : Either you
must resolve not to visit Sir George, or else be
contented to see me die at your Feet.

Was ever any Lady in so cruel a Dilemma ?
said Arabella, throwing herself into the Chair
in a languishing Posture: What can I do to
prevent the Fate of two Persons, one of whom
I infinitely pity, and the other, obstinate as he
is, I cannot hate ? Shall I resolve to let the
miserable Bellmour die, rather than grant him a
Favour the most rigid Virtue would not refuse
him ? or shall I, by opposing the impetuous
Humour of a Lover, to whom I am ,
make myself the Author of his
Death ? Fatal Necessity ! which obliges me
either to be. cruel or unjust; and, with a Disposition

to neither, makes me, in some Degree,
guilty of both !

C H A P. III.
In which our Heroine is isn some lildl

W H I L E Arabella was uttering this pathetic

Complaint, Mr. Glanville, with
great Difficulty, kept himself from smilingly
by fine supplicating Looks to his Sister,
prevented her laughing out; yet she giggled in
secret behind her Fan : But Arabella was so lot
in her melancholy Reflections, that she kept
her Eyes immoveable fixed on the Ground for
Ime Moments: At last, casting an upbraiding
Glance at Glanville;

Is it possible, cruel Person that you are!'
said she to him, that you can, without Pity;
see me sussex so much Uneasiness; and, knowing
the Sensibility of my Temper, can expose me
to the Grief of being accessory to the Death cf
an unfortunate Man, guilty indeed of a too
violent Passion, which merits a gentler Punish.
ment, than that you doom him to ?

Don't be uneasy, dear Cousin, interrupted:
Miss Glanville; I dare assure you Sir George
won't die.
'It is impossible to think that,. said Arabella',
once he has not so much as received a Command
from me olive;. but tell me truly, pursued
The, do you believe it probable, that he will
obey. me, and live ?.

Indeed, Madam, said Miss Glanville, I could
swear for him that he will.

Well, replied Arabella, I will content myself
with sending him my Commands in Writing;
.but it is to be feared they will not have so much
Efficacy upon his Spirit.
Mr. Glanville, extremely pleased that she
had laid aside her Design of visiting Sir George,
did not oppose her writing to him, though he
was plotting how to prevent the Letter reaching
.his Hands; and while she went into her Closet
to write, he conferred with his Sister upon the
Means he should use, expressing, at the same
time, great Resentment against Sir George,
for endeavouring to supplant him in his'Coufin's
A scion.

What then, said Miss Glanville, do you
really imagines George is in Love with Lady
Bella ?

'He is .either in Love with her Person or
Estate, replied Mr. Glanville, or perhaps with
both; for flie is handsome enough to gain a
Lover of his Merit, though flie had no Fortune;
and .the has Fortune enough to do it,
though flie had no Beauty.

My Cousin is well enough, to be sure, said
Miss Glanville ; but I never could think her a
Beauty.

If, replied Mr. Glanville, a moR lovely
*Complexion, regular Features, a fine Stature,
an elegant Shape, and an inexpressible Grace
in all her Motions, can form, a Beauty, ,Lady
Bella nay pretend to hat Character, without
any Dispute.



Though She was all that you say, returned
Miss Glanville, I am certain Sir George is not
in Love with her.

I wish I was certain of that, replied Mr.
Glanville for 'tis very probable you are mistaken.


You may see by his Letter, interrupted Miss
Glanville, what a Jest he makes of her; and
if you had heard how he talked to her the other
Day in the Garden, you would have died with
Laughing; yet my poor Cousin thought he was
very serious, and was so foolishly pleased !

I assure you Charlotte, said Mr. Glanville,
gravely, I [hall take it very ill, if you make so
free with your Cousin's little Foibles; and if
Sir George presumes to make a Jest of her, as
you say, I shall teach him better Manners.

You are the strangest Creature in the World i
said Miss Glanville: A Minute or two ago, you
was wishing to be sure he was not in Love with
her ; and now you are angry, when I assure
you he is only in Jest.

Arabella, that Moment coming outs her
Closet, broke off their Discourse. I have
written to Sir George, said the, addressing herself
to Mr. Glanville ; and you are at Liberty, if
you please, to read my Letter, which I propose
to send away immediately.

Mr. Glanville, taking the Letter out of her
Hand, with a low Bow, began to read it to
himself; but Arabella, willing his Sister [hould
also be acquainted with the Contents, obliged
him, much against his Will, to read it aloud.
It was as follows;

Arabella, To Bellmour.
W HATE VER Offence your presume.

tous Declaration may have given me,
yet my Resentment will be appeared with a
less Punishment than Death: And that
Grief and Submission you have testified in your
Letter, may haply have already procured you
Pardon for your Fault, provided you do not
forfeit it by Disobedience.

I therefore command you to live, . nd command
you by all that Power you have given me
over you.

Remember I require no more of you, than
.Parifatis did of Lysimachus, in a more cruel
and insupportable Misfortune: Imitate then
the Obedience and Submission of that illustrious
Prince;' and tho' you Should be as unfortunate
as he, let.your Courage also be equal to his;
and, like him, be contented with the Esteem
that is offered you, since it is all that can be
bestowed, by

Mr. Glanville, finding by this Epistle, that
,arabella did not design to encourage the Addresses
of Sir George, would not have been
against his receiving it, had he not feared the
Consequence of his having such a convincing
Proof of the Peculiarity of her Temper in his
Possession; and while he kept the Letter in his
Hand, as if he wanted to consider it a little
better, he meditated on the Means to prevent
its being ever delivered ; and had possibly fixed
upon Come successful Contrivance, when a

Servant coming in, to inform the Ladies, that
Sir George was come to wait on them, put an
End to his Schemes; and he immediately ran
down to receive him, not being willing to increase,
by his Stay, the Astonishment and confusion,
which appeared in the Countenance of
Arabella, at hearing a Man, whom flie'had
believed and represented to be dying, was
come to pay her a Visit.

Where the Lady extricates herself out of

her former Confusion, to the great Astonishment,
we will suppose, of the Reader.

M I S S Glanville, not having so much Delicacy

as her Brother, could not help
exulting a little upon this Occasion.

After the terrible Fright you have been in,
Madam, said she, upon Sir George's Account,
I wonder you do not rather think it is his
Geoff than himself, that is come to see us.

There is no Question, but it is himself that
is come, said Arabella, (who had already reconciled
this Visit, to her first Thoughts of him;)
and it is, haply, to execute his fatal Design in
my Presence, that has brought him here ; and,
like the unfortunate Almond, he means to
convince me of his Fidelity and Love, by falling
upon his Sword before my Eyes,

Bless me, Madam, said Miss Glanville, what
horrid Things come into your Head ! I vow,
you terrify me out of my Wits, to hear you.

There is no Occasion for your Fears, interrupted
Arabella: Since we already fufpcEt his
Designs, it will be very easy to prevent them:
Ha.dthe Princess of the Sarmatia known the
fatal'Intentions of her despairing Lover, doubtless,
should have used some Precautions to
hinder him from executing them ; for want of
which, she saw the miserable Agilmnalnd weltering
in his Blood at her Feet; and with Reason
accused herself of being the Cause of so
deplorable a Spectacle.

The Astonishment Miss Glanville was in, to
hear her Cousin talk in this Manner, kept her
!rom giving her any Interruption, while flie related
several other terrible Instances of Dlerair.

In the mean time, Sir George, who was impatient
to go up to Lady Bella's Apartment,
having flattered himself with an Hope, that his
Letter was favourably received; and that he
should be permitted to hope at leaf ; made a
short Visit to Sir Charles in his own Room; and,
accompanied by Mr. Glanville, who was resolved
to see in what manner arabella received
him, went to her Apartment.

As he had taken care, at his Entrance, to
accommodate his Looks to the Charater he
had assumed of an humble despairing Lover,
Arabella no sooner saw him, but her Countenance
changed; and, making a Sign to Mr.
Glanville, who could not comprehend what
flie meant, to seize upon the Guard of his
Sword, the hastily stept forward to meet him.

VOL. 11, C I am

I am too well convinced, said flie to Sir
George, that the Intent of overcoming hither
To day, is to commit some Violence against
yourself before my Eyes: But listen not, I beseech
you, to the Dictates of your Despair:
Live; Command you, live; and since you say,
I have the absolute Disposal of your Life, do
not deprive yourself of it, without the Content
of her, on whom you profess to have bestowed
it.

Sir George, who did not imagine Arabella
would communicate his Letter to her Cousins,
and only expected some distant Hints from her
concerning it, was so confounded at this Reception
before them, that he was no; able to
reply: He blushed, and turned pale alternately;
and, not daring to look, either upon Miss Glanville,
or her Brother, or to meet the Eyes of the
fair Visionary, who, with great Impatience,
his Answer, he hung down his Head
in avery filly Posture; and, by his Silence, confirmed
Arabella in her Opinion.

As he did not want for Wit and Assurance,
during that Interval of Silence, and Expectation
from all Parties; his Imagination suggested
to him the Means of extricating himself out of
the ridiculous Perplexity he was in; and as it
concerned him greatly to avoid any Quarrel,
with the Brother and Sister, he determined to
turn the whole Matter into a Jest; but, if pos
to manage it so, that Arabella should not
enter into )tis Meaning.

Raising therefore his Eyes, and looking upon
.patella with a melancholy Air;

You are not deceived, Madam, said he: This
Criminal, with whom you are so justly offended,
comes with an Intention to die at your
Feet, and breathe out his miserable Life, to expiate
those Crimes of which you accuse him:
But since your revere Compassion will oblige
me to live, I obey, oh ! mos divine, but cruel
Arabella ! I obey your harsh Commands; and,
by endeavouring to live, give you a more convincing
Proof of that Respect and Submission
I (hall always have for your Will.

I expected no less from your Courage and
Generosity, 'aid Arabella, with a Look of great
Complacency ; and since you so well know
how to imitate the great Lysimachus in your
Obedience, I shall not be less acknowleging
then the fair Paratus ; but will have for you
an Esteem equal to that Virtue I have observed
in you.

Sir George, having received this gracious promise,
with a most profound Bow, turned to
Mr. Glanville, with a kind of chastened Smile
upon his Countenance.

And, you, fortunate and deserving Knight,
said he, happy in the Affections of the fairest
Person in the World ! grudge me not this small
Alleviation of my Misfortunes ; and envy me
not that Esteem, which alone is able to make
me sussex Life, while you possess, in the Heart
of the divine Arabella, a Felicity that might
be envied by the greatest Monarchs in the
World.

As diverting as this Scene was, Mr. Glanville
was extremely uneasy: For though Sir
George's Stratagem took, and he believed he

C 2 was

was only indulging the Gaiety of his Humour,
by carrying on this Farce ; yet he could not
endure, he should divert himself at Arabella's
Expence. The solemn Speech he had made him,
did indeed force him to smile ; but he soon ashamed
a graver Look, and told Sir George, ina
low Voice, that when he had finished his
Visit, he should be glad to take a Turn with
him in the Garden.

Sir George promised to follow him, and Mr.
Glanville left the Room, and went into the
Gardens; where the Baronet, having taken a
respectful Leave of Arabella, and, by a fly
Glance, convinced Miss Glanville, he had sacrificed
her Cousin to her Mirth, went to join
her Brother.

1Mr. Glanville, as soon as he saw him, walked
to meet him with a very reserved Air: Which
Sir George observing, and being resolved to keep
up his Humour;

What, inhuman, but too happy Lover, said
he, what, am I to understand by that Cloud
upon your Brow? Is it possible, that thou
canst envy me the small Comfort I have received
; and, not satisfied with the glorious
Advantages thou poffleff'e, wilt thou still deny
me that Esteem, which the divine Arabella
has been pleated to bestow upon me?

Pray, Sir George, said Mr. Glanville, lay
aside this pompous Style : I am not disposed to
be ,merry at present, and have not all the relish
for this kind of Wit, that you seem to expect.
I desired to see you here, that I might
tell you without Witnesses, I take it extremely
ill, you should presume to make my Cousin

the Objet of your Mirth. Lady Bella, Sir,
is not a Person, with whom such Liberties
ought to be taken; nor will I, in the double
Charater of her Lover and Relation, sussex it
from any one whatever.

Cruel Fortune! said Sir George, stepping back
a little, and lifting up his Eyes, shall I always
be exposed to thy Persecutions ? And
must I, without any apparent Cause, behold
an Enemy in the Person of my Friend ; who,
though, without murmuring, I resign to hint
the adorable arabella, is yet resolved to dispute
with me, a Satisfaction, which does not
deprive him of any Part of that glorious Fortune
to which he is destined ? Since it is so,
unjust and cruel Friend, pursued he, shrike
this Breast, which carries the Image of the
divine Arabella ; but think not, that I will offer
to defend myself, or lift my Sword, against a
Man beloved by her.

This is all very fine, returned Mr.\ Glanville,
hardly able to forbear laughing; but 'tis
impossible, with all your Gaiety, to hinder me
from being serious upon this Business.

Then be as serious as thou wilt, dear Charles,
interrupted Sir George, provided you will allow
me to be gay; and not pretend to infect me
with thy unbecoming Gravity.

I have but a few Words to say to you, then,
Sir, replied Mr. Glanville: Eit!i; behave with
more RefpeE to my Cousin ; or prepare to
give me Satisfaction, for the Insults you after
her.

Oh! I underhand you, Sir, said Sir George;
and because you have taken it into your Head

to be offended at a Trifle of no Consequence in
the World, I must give you a fair Chance to
run me through the Body ! There is something
very foolish, faith, in rich an extravagant expectation:
But since Caution has made it ,
that a Man must venture his Soul and
Body upon these important Occasions ; because
I will not be out of the Fashion, you (hall command
me whenever you think fit; though I
ha!li fight with lmy Schoolfellow with a very
ill Will, I allure you.

'inhere is no Necessity for fighting, said Mr.
Glanville, blushing at the ludicrous Light, in
which the gay Baronet had placed his Challenge:
'The Concession I have required, is very small,
and not worth the contesting for, on your Side.
Sad Beiila's Peculiarity, to which you contribute
so much, can afford you, at bell,. but an
iii-natured Diversion, while it gives me a real
Pain:, and sure, you must acknowlege, you
are doing me a very great Injury, when you
endeavour to confirm a Lady, who is to be my
Wife, in a Behaviour that excites your Mirth,
and makes her a fit Object for your Ridicule,
and Contempt.

You do Lady Bella, a inch greater Injury
than I do, replied Sir George, by supposing,
the can ever be an Object of Ridicule and Contempt:
I think very highly of her Understanding
; and though the Bent of her Studies has
given her Mind a romantic 'Turn, yet the
Singularity of her Manners is far lets disagreeable,
than the lighter 'allies of most of her
SBx.

But to be absolutely perseS,, interrupted Mr.
Glanville, I must cure her of that Singularity;
and therefore 1 beg you will not persist in assuming
a Behaviour conforillaile to her romantic
Ideas; but rather help me to banish then
from her Imagination.

Well, replied Sir George, since you no longer
threaten, I'll do what I can to content your b ut
I nul quit my Heroics by Degrees, and link
with Decency into my own Character ; otherwise
freewill never endure me in her Piefer.cc.

Arabella and miss Glanville, appearing in
the Walk, broke off the Conversation. - The
Baronet and Mr. Glanville walked forward to
meet them; but Arabella, who did not desire
Company, struck into another Walk, whither
Mr. Glanville following, proposed to join
her; when he saw his Father, who had been
taking a Turn there alone, make up to Arabella;
and, supposing he would take that Opportunity
to talk to her concerning him, he
went back to his Sister and Sir George, whose
Conversation he interrupted, to the great Regret
of Miss Glanville.

In which will be found one of tIe former

viifsiakes pursued, and another cleared

Persons; among whom, the Reader, we

JR AB E L L A no sooner saw Sir Carle
advancing towards her, when, Sensible of
til Consequence of being alone with a
whom she did not doubt, would make use
of that Advantage, to talk to her of Love, the
endeavoured to avoid him, but in vain; for Sir
Charles, guessing her Intentions, walked hastily
up to her; and, taking hold of her Hand,

You muss not go away, Lady Bella, said he:
1 have something to say to you.

Arabella, extremely discomposed at this Behaviour,
struggled to free her Hand from her
Uncle; and, giving him a Look, on which Disdain
and Fear were visibly painted,

Unhand me, Sir, said she, and force me not
to forget the Refpet I owe you, as my Uncle,
by treating you with a Severity such uncommon
Insolence demands.

Sir Charms, letting go her Hand in a great
Surprize, at the Word Insolent, which fie had-used,
asked her, If flie knew to whom she was
speaking?

Questionless, I am speaking to my Uncle,
replied (he; and 'tis with great Regret I see
minyflf obliged to make use of Expressions noway

conformable to the Refpet I bear that
sacred Character.

And, pray, Madam, said Sir Charles, somewhat
fastened by this Speech, who is it that
obliges you to lay aside that Respect you seem
to acknowlege is due to your Uncle ?

You do, Sir, replied she; and 'tis with infinite
Sorrow, that I beheld you assuming a
Character unbecoming the Brother of my Father.


This is pretty plain, indeed, interrupted Sir
Charles : But pray, Madam, inform me, what
it is you complain of.

You, questionless, know much better than I
can tell you, replied Arabella, blushing, the
Offence I accuse you of nor is it proper forme
to mention, what it would not become me
to sussex.

Zounds ! cried Sir Charles, no longer able
to suppress his growing Anger, this is enough
to make a Man mad.

Ah ! 1 beseech you, Sir, resumed Arabella,
sussex not an unfortunate and ill-judged Passion
to be the Bane of all your Happiness and
Virtue: Recall your wandring Thoughts; reflex
upon the Dishonour you will bring upon
yourself, by persisting in such unjustifiable Sentiments.


I do not know how it is possible to avoid it,
said Sit Charles; and, notwithstanding all this
fine Reasoning, there are few People but would
fly into greater Extremities; but my Affection
for you makes me.

Hold, hold, I conjure you, Sir, interrupted
Arabella; force me not to listen to such ilnurioui

Language; carry that odious Affection ofme-
wVhele le ; and do not persecute an unfortunate
Laid, who has contributed nothing to thy
Fault, and is only guilty of too much compassion
for thy Weakness.

Good God, cried Sir Charles, ftartingback,
:(nd looking upon Arabella with Astonishment;
how I pity my Son ! What would I not give, if
he did not love this Girl ?

Think not, replied Arabella, that the Passion
your Son has for me, makes your Condition a
bit the worse; for I would be such as I am,
with respect to you, were there no Mr. Glans
in the World.

I never thought, Niece, said Sir Charles, asser
a little Pause, that any Part of my Behaviour,
could give you the Offence you complain
of, or authorize that Hatred and Contempt
you take the Liberty to express for me:
But Since it is so, I promise you, I will quit
your House, and have you to your self; I have
always been solicitous for your Welfare; and,
ungrateful as you are-call

me not ungrateful, interrupted
again : Heaven is my Witness, that had
you not forgot I was your niece, I would have
always remembred you was my Uncle; and
not only have regarded you as such, but have
looked upon you as another Father, under
whose Direction Providence had placed me,
since it had deprived me of my real Father; and
whose Tenderness and Care, might have in
some measure supplied the Loss I had of him:
But Heaven has decreed it otherwise; and since
it is his Will, that I should be deprived of the

Comfort and Afliluancc my Orphan State ,
I must submit, without murmuring, to
my Destiny. Go then, unfortunate and lamented
Uncle, pursued the, wiping fine
hears from her fine Eyes go, and endeavour
by Reason and Absence to recover thy repose
; and be assured, whenever you can convince
me you have triumphed over these Sentiments
which now cause both our Unhappiness,
you shall have no Calc to complain of my
Conduct towards you.

Finishing there Words, she left him with so
much Speed. that it would have been impose'
bible for him to have flopped her, though lie
had intended it: But indeed, he was so loll in
Wonder and Confusion at a Behaviour for
which he was not able to assign any other
Cause than Madness, that he remained fixed
in the tame Posture of Surprize, in which flie
had left him; and from which he was first interrupted
by til Voice of his Sin, who, fe
ing Arabella flying towards the House in great
seeming Emotion, came to know the Result of
their Conversation.

Sir, said Mr. Glanville, who had spoken to
his Father before, but had no Answer, will
you not inform me, what Success you have had
with my Cousin ? How did she receive your
Proposal.

Speak of her no more, said Sir Charles, she
is a proud ungrateful Girl, and unworthy the
Affection you have for her.

Mr. Glanville, who trembled to hear so unfavourable
an Answer to his Inquiries, awestruck
dumb with his Surprize and Grief; when

C 6 Si

Sir Charles taking Notice of the Alteration in
his Countenance;

I am sorry, said he, to find you have set
your Heart upon this fantastic Girl: If ever
Ihe be your Wife, which I very much doubt,
she will make you very unhappy: But, Charles,
pursued he, I would advise you to think no
more of her; content yourself with the Eifate
you gain by her Refusal of you: With that Addition
to your own Fortune, you may pretend
to any Lady whatever; and you will find many
that are full as agreeable as your Cousin, who
will be proud of your Addresses.

Indeed, Sir, said Mr. Glanville, with a Sigh,
there is no Woman upon Earth whom I would
choose to marry, but Lady Bella I flattered
myself, I had been happy enough to have made
Ime Progress in her Affection; but it seems, I
was mistaken; however, I hould be glad to
know, if she gave you any Reasons for refuting
inc.

Reasons ! said Sir Charles: There is no making
her hear Reason, or expecting Reason from
her; I never knew so strange a Woman in my
Life : She would not allow me to speak what
J intended concerning you; but interrupted me,
every Moment, with tome high-flown Stuff or
other.

Then I have not lost all Hopes of her, cried
Mr. Glanville eagerly; for since flie did not
hear what you had to say, The could not possibly
deny you.

But flie behaved in a very impertinent Manner
to me, interrupted Sir Charles; complained
of my harsh Treatment of her; and laid several

other Things, which, because of her uncommon
Style, I could not perfectly understand;
vet they seemed shocking; and, upon the Whole,
treated me so rudely, that I am determined to
leave her to herself, and trouble my Head no
more about her.

For God's sake, dear Sir, said Mr. Glanville,
alarmed at this Resolution, suspend your
Anger, till I have seen my Cousin: There is
some Mistake, I am persuaded, in all this. I
know she has some very odd Humours, which
you are not so well acquainted with, as 1 am.
I'll go to her, and prevail upon her to explain
herself.

You may do so, if you please, replied Sir
Charles; but I fear it will be to very little Purpose;
for I really fufpei her Head is a little
turned: I do not know what to do with her:
It is not fit she should have the Management of
herself; and yet 'tis impossible to live upon easy
Terms with her.

Mr. Glanville, who did not doubt but Arabella
had been guilty of some very ridiculous
Folly, offered nothing more in her Justification;
but, having attended his Father to his own
Chamber went to Arabella's Apartment.

He found the pensive Fair-one, in a melancholy
Posture, her Head reclined upon one
of her fair Hands; and though her Eyes were
fixed upon a Book she held in the other, yet
she did not seem to read, but rather to be
wholly buried in Contemplation.

Mr. Glinville having so happily found her
alone (for her Women were not then in her
Chamber) seated himself near her ; having first

attired Pardon for the Interruption he had given
;o her Studies; and , bella, throwing aside her
Book, prepared to lien to his Discourse;
which by the Agitation, which appeared in
Looks, Ihe imagined, would be upon some
extraordinary Subject.

1 left miy Father jul now, said he, in a
gicat deal of Uneasiness, on account of something
you slid to h;m, Lady Bella : He apprehends
you are disobliged, and he would
willingly know how.

Ii s your Father then acquainted you with
the Subjec of our Conversation? interrupted
firabclla. I know what would have been the Subject of
your Conversation, replied Mr. Glanville, if.
you bad been pleased to ]often to what Sir
Circles intended to say to you on my behalf.


On your Behalf? interrupted Arabella: Ah
poor deceived Glanville! how I pity thy blind
Sincerity ! But it is not for me to undeceive
thee: Only thus much I must say to you, Beware
of committing your Interests to a Person, who
will be a much better Advocate for another
than for you.

Mr. Glanville, rejoiced to find by there
'Words, that her Resentment against his Father
was occasioned by a Suspicion so favourable
for him, assured her, that Sir Cartes
wished for nothing more earnestly, than that he
might be able to merit her Etfeem ; and that
it was to dispose her to listen to his Addresses,
that he wanted to discourse with her that Morning.


Mr. Glavziile, being obliged, through his
Knowlege of his Cousin's Temper, to speak
to her in this distant Manner, went on with
his Alliances of his Father's Candour in this
Refpea ; and Arabella, who would not declare
her Reasons for doubting it, only replied,
That flie wished Sir Cbarles meant all that he
had said to him ; but that Ihe could not persuade
herself to believe him sincere, till his future
AEtions had convinced her he was so.

Mr. Glanville, impatient to let his Father
know, how greatly he had been mistaken in
the Cause of Arabella's Behaviour, made his
Visit shorter than he would otherwise have done,
in order to undeceive him.

Is it possible, said Sir Charles, when his Son
had repeated tie Conversation he had just had
with Arabella,, that file could be so foolish, as
to imagine, I had a Design to propose any one
else to her but you ? What Reason have I. ever
given her, to think I would not be glad to
have her for my Daughter-in-law ? Indeed,
she has some odd Ways that are very disagreeable;
but she is one of the best Matches in
England for all that: Poor Girl! pursued he,
the had Reason to be angry, if that was the
Case; and now I remember, she cried, when
1 told her I would leave the House ; yet her
Spirit was so great, that she told me, I might
go. Well, i'll go and make it up with her;
but who could have imagined, she would have
been so foolish ? Sir Charles, at the Repetition
of these Words, hurried away to Arabella's
Apartment,

Niece, said he at his Entrance, I am come
to ask you Pardon, for having led you into a
Belief, that I meant-tis

enough, Sir, interrupted Arablla; I grant
you my Pardon for what is past; and as it does not
become me to receive Submissions from my
Uncle, while he remembers he is so, I will dispense
with your Acknowledgements at present:
Only to convince me, that this sudden Alteration
is sincere, avoid, I beseech you, for the future,
all Occasions of displeasing me.

I protest, cried Sir Charles, that I never intended


I will not hear you say a Word more of your
pail Intentions, interrupted Arabella again: I
have forgot them all; and, while you continue
to regard me as your Niece, I will never
remember them to your Disadvantage.

Then I may hope, said Sir Charles
! Heavens ! cried Arabella, not suffering
him to proceed; do you come to insult me
thus, with a mock Repentance ? And has my
Easiness, in being so ready to forget the Injury
you would have done me, made you presumptuous
enough to cherish an insolent Hope
that I will ever change my Resolution ?

How vexatious is this ! replied Sir Charles,
fretting to see her continually mistaking him.
I swear to you, by all that is sacred, that 'tis
my Son, for whom I would solicit your Consent.


How! said Arabella, astonished, Will you
then be just at last ? And can you resolve to
plead for that Son, whose Interest, but a Moment
ago, you would have destroyed ?

I see, said Sir Charles, it is impossible to
convince you.

No, no interrupted Arabella, hastily; it is
not impossible but my own ardent Wishes that
it may be so, will help to convince me of the
Truth of what you say: For in fine, do you
think, I shall not be as glad as yourself, to find
you capable of acting honourably by your Son;
and to see myself no longer the Cause of the
most unjustifiable Contra imaginable ?

Sir Charles was opening his Mouth, to press
her in Favour of Mr. Glanville ; whom,' notwithstanding
her strange Behaviour, he was
glad to find, she loved ; when arabella preventing
him,

Seek not, I beseech you, said she, to destroy
that Belief I am willing to give your
Words, by any more Attempts at this time
to persuade me; for truly, I shall interpret
your Solicitude no way in your Favour ; therefore,
if you desire I should be convinced you
are sincere, let the Silence I require of you, be
one Proof of it.

Sir Charles, who looked excessively out of
Countenance at such a peremptory Command
from his Niece, was going out of her Chamber
in a very ill Humour, when the Dinner-bell
ringing, the gave him her Hand, with a
very. gracious Air; and permitted him to lead
her into the Dining-room, where they found
Mr. Glanville, his Sister, and Sir George, who
had been detained to Dinner by Miss Glanville,
expecting their coming.

CH A P. VI.
Containing some Account of. Thalefris,

.been of the Amazons, with other
curious Anecdotes.

Lady Bella having recovered her usual
(fearfulness, thro' tile Satisfaction file
felt at her Uncle's returning to Reason, and
the Abatement she perceived in Sir George's
extreme Melancholy, mixed in the Conversation
with that Wit and Vivacity which was
natural to her, and which so absolutely charmed-the
whole Company, that not one of them remembred
any of her former Extravagancies.

Mr. Glanville gazed on her with a passionate
Tenderness, Sir George with Admiration, and
the old Baronet with Wonder and Delight.

But Miss Glanville, who was inwardly vexed.
at the Superiority her Cousin's Wit gave her
over herself, wished for nothing more than an
Opportunity of interrupting a Conversation in
which the could have no Share; and, willing.
to put them in mind of some of Arabella's
strange Notions, when [he observed them
disputing concerning some of the AEtions ot
the antient Romans, She very innocently asked
Sir George, Whether in former times Women
went to the Wars, and fought like Men ? For
my Cousin, added she, talks of one Thalers, a-
Woman, that was as courageous as any Soldier
whatever.

Mr. Glanville, horridly vexed at a Question
that was likely to engage Arabella in a Discourse
very different from that fie had been Co capable
of pleating in, frowned very intelligible at
his Sister; and, to prevent any Answer being
given to her absurd Demand, directed some
other Conversation to Arabella : But the, who
law a favourite Subjec started, took no Notice
of what Mr. Glanville was flying to her ; but,
directing her Looks to Sir George,

Though Miss Glanville, said she, be a little
mistaken in the Name of that fair Queen she
has mentioned ; yet I am persuaded you know
whom she means; and that it is the renowned
Thalefris, whose Valour flaggers her Belief,
and of whom the waits to be informed.

Ay, ay, Tbale/lris, fid Miss Glanville : It
is such a strange Name I could not remember
it; but, pray, was there ever such a Person ?

Certainly, Madam, there was, replied Sir
George: She was Queen of the Amazons, a warlike
Nation of Women, who possessed great
Part of Cappadocia, and extended their conquests
so far, that they became formidable to
all their Neighbours.

You find, Miss, said Arabella, I did not attempt
to impose upon you, when I told you
of the admirable Valour of that beautiful
Queen; which indeed was so great, that the
united Princes, in whose Cause she sought,
looked upon her Assistance to be equal to that
of a whole Army; and they honoured her,
accordingly, with the most distinguishing Marks
of their Esteem and Acknowlegement, and
offered her the chief Command of their Forces.

0 shameful ! cried Sir Charles, offer a
Woman the Command of an Army ! Brave
Fellows indeed, that would be commanded by
a Woman ! Sure you mistake, Niece; there
never was such a thins heard of in the World.

What, Sir, slid Arabella, will you contradict
a Sad attested by the greatest Historians that
ever were ? You may as well pretend to say,.
there never were such Persons as Oroondates or
7luba, as dispute the Existence of the famous
'han ,th is.

Why, pray, Madam, said Sir Charles, who
were those ?

One of them, replied Arabella, was the
great King of Scythia ; and the other, Prince
of the Two Mauritania.

Ods-heart ! interrupted Sir Charles, I believe
their Kingdoms are in the Moon: I never heard
of Scythia, or the Two Mauritania, before.

And yet, Sir, replied Arabella, those Kingdoms
are doubtless as well known, as France
or England; and there is no Question, but the
Descendants of the great Oroondates, and the
valiant cuba, sway the Sceptres of them to this
Day.

I must confess, said Sir George, I have a
very great Admiration for those Two renowned
Princes, and have read their beautiful Exploits
with infinite Pleasure ; notwithstanding which,
I am more inclined to seem the great Artaban,
then either of them.

Though Artaban, replied Arabella, is without
Question,' a Warrior equal to either of them,
and haply no Person in the World possessed so
sublime a Courage as his was; yet, it may be,

your Partiality proceeds from another Cause;
and you having the Honour to refcnible him in
some little Infidelities he was accused of, with
.less Justice than yourself perhaps, induces you
to favour him more than any other.

arabella blushed when the ended these
Words: And Sir George replied, with a Sigh;

I have, indeed, the Honour, Madam, to resemble
the great Artaban, in having dared to
raise my Thoughts towards a Divine Person,
who, with Reason, condemns my Adorations.

Hey-day ! cried Sir Charles, are you going
to speak of Divine Things, after all the Fables
you have been talking of ? Troth, I love to
hear young Men enter upon such Subject : But
pray, Niece, who told you Sir George was an
Infidel ?

Mr. Glanville, replied Arabella : And I am
inclined to think he spoke Truth ; for Sir
George has never pretended to deny it.

How ! interrupted Sir Charles; I am ferry
to hear that. 1 hope you have never, added
he, looking at the young Baronet, endeavoured
to corrupt my Son with any of your
Free-thinking Principles: I am for everybody
having Liberty of Conscience; but I
cannot endure to hear People of your Stamp
endeavouring to propagate your mischievous
Notions; and because you have no Regard for
your own future Happiness, disturbing other
People in the laudable Pursuit of theirs.

We will not absolutely condemn Sir George,
said Arabella, till we have heard his History
from his own Mouth, which he promised, sometime
ago, to relate when I desired it.

I do not imagine his History is fit to be heard
by Ladies, said Sir Charles ; for your Infidels
live a strange kind of Lite.

However that may be, replied Arabella, we
must not dispense with Sir George from performing
his Promise : 1 dare say there are no
Ladies here, who will think the worse of hi
for freely confessing his Faults.

You may answer for yourself, if you please,
Madam, said Sir Charles; but I hope my Girl
there, will not say as much.

I dare say my Cousin is not so rigid, said
Arabella: She has too much the Spirit of julia
in her, to find Fault with a little Infidelity.

I am always obliged to you for your Comparisons,
Cousin, said Mils Glanville : I suppose
this is greatly to my Advantage too.

I aflureyou, Madam, said Sir George, Lady
-Bella has done you no Injury by the Comparison
the has just now made; for Julia was one
of the finest Princesses in the World.

Yet she was not free from the Suspicion of
Infidelity, replied Arabella; but though I do
not pretend to tax my Cousin with that Fault,
yet it is with a great deal of Reason that I say
the resembles her in her volatile Humour.

I was never thought to be ill-humoured in
my Life, Madam, said Miss Glanville, colouring;
and I cannot imagine what Reason I
have given you for saying I am.

Nay, Cousin, said Arabella, I am not condemning
your humour; for, to say the Truth,
there are a great many Charms in a volatile
Disposition; and, notwithftandingthe admirable
Beauty of julia, it is possible flie made as

many Slaves by her light and airy Carriage, as
the did by her Eyes, though they were the
fairest in the World, except the divine Cleopatra's.


Cleopatra ! cried Sir Charles: Why she was
a Gypsy, was she not ?

I never heard ledger so, said Arabella,
gravely; and I am apt to believe you are not at
all acquainted with her: But pray, pursued the,
let us wave this Discourse at present, and prepare
to listen to Sir George's Relation of his
Life; which, I dare say, is full of very extraordinary
Events: However, Sir, added fie, di-ring
her Speech to the young Baronet, I am
afraid your Modesty will induce you to speak
with less Candour than you ought, of those
great Ations, which questionless you have performed:
Therefore we fall hear your History,
with greater Satisfaction, from the Mouth of
your faithful 'Squire, who will not have the
same Reasons that you have, for suppressing
what is most admirable in the Adventures of
your Life.

Since it is your Pleasure, Madam, replied
Sir George, to hear my Adventures, I will recount
them as well as I am able myself, to
the end that I may have an Opportunity of
obliging you by doing rome Violence to my natural
Modesty, which will not sussex me to relate
Things the World have been pleased to
speak of to my Advantage, without some little
Confusion.

Then, casting down his Eyes, he seemed to
be recollecting the most material Passages in his
Life. Mr. Glanville, though he could have

wished he had not indulged Arabella in her ridiculous
Request, was not able to deny himself
the Division of hearing what Kind of History
he would invent; and therefore resolved to stay
and listen to him.

Mils Glanville was also highly delighted with
the Proposal; but Sir Charles, who could not
conceive there could be any thing worth
listening to, in a young Rake's Account of
himself, got up with an Intention to walk in
the Garden ; when, perceiving it rained, he
changed his Resolution, and, resuming his Seat,
prepared to listen, as every one else did, to the
expected Story.

When Sir George, after having paused a
Quarter of an Hour longer, during which all
the Company observed a profound Silence, began
his Relation in this Manner, addressing
himself to Arabella.

Containing the Beginning of Sir George.,

History ; in which the ingenious Relater
has exactly copied the Stile of Romance.

1-10 UG H at present, Madnlm,
you behold me in the Quality of a
private Gentleman, in the Posts.
sion only of a tolerable Estate;
yet my Barth is illustrious enough:
My Ancestors having formerly worn a Crown,
which, as they won by their Valour, so they lull
by their Misfortune only.

Voj.L . II D low,

How, interrupted Sir Charles, are you descended
from Kings ? Why, I never heard you
say so before; Pray, Sir, how far are you removed
from Royal Blood ? and which of your
Forefathers was it that wore a Crown ?

Sir, replied Sir George, it is not much more
than Eight hundred Years since my Ancestors,
who were Saxons, swayed the Sceptre of Kent;
and from the first Monarch of that mighty
Kingdom, am I lineally descended.

Pray where may that Kingdom of Kent lie
Laid Sir Charles.

In-replied Sir George.
A mighty Kingdom indeed ! said Sir Charles:
Why, it makes but a very fall Part of theKing-
.dom of Britain now: Well, if your ancestors
were Kings of that County as it is now
called, it must be confessed their Dominions
were very small.

However that may be, said Arabella, it raises
Sir George greatly in my Esteem, to hear he is
descended from Kings; for, truly, a Royal extraction
does infinitely fct off noble and valiant
Actions, and inspires only lofty and generous
Sentiments: Therefore, illustrious Prince (for
in that ;gift I shall always consider you), be
al.;ired, .tough Fortune has despoiled you of
you r Dominions, yet since she cannot deprive
y ,u of your Courage and Virtue, Providence
weil one Day lift your noble Endeavours to
recover your Rights, and place you upon the
Throne of your Ancestors, from whence you
nave been fb inhumanly driven : Or, haply, to
repair that Loi's, your Valour may procure you

other Kingdoms, no less considerable than that
to which you was born.

For Heaven's sake, Niece, said Sir Charles,
How come such improbable Things into your
Head ? Is it such an easy Matter, think you, to
conquer Kingdoms, that you can flatter a young
Man, who has neither Fleets nor Armies, with
such strange Hopes ?

The great Artaban, Sir, resumed Arabella,
had neither Fleets nor Armies, and was Master
only of a single Sword ; yet he soon law himself
greater than any King, disposing the destinies
of Monarchs by his Will, and deciding
the Fates of Empires by a single Word: But
pray let this Dispute rest where it is, and permit
Sir George to continue his Relation.

It is not necessary, Madam, resumed Sir
Geoale, to acquaint you with the Misfortunes
of my Family, or relate the several Progressions
it made towards the private Condition in
which it now is: For, besides that reciting the
Events of so many Hundred Years may haply,
in feme measure, try your Patience, 1 should
be glad if you would dispense with me from
entering into a Detail of Accidents that would
sensibly afflict me : It shall suffice, therefore, to
inform you, that my Father, being a peaceable
Man, fond of Retirement and 'Tranquillity,
made no Attempts to recover the Sovereignty
from which his Ancestors had been unjustly
expelled; but quietly beheld the Kingdom of
Kent in the Possession of other Matters, whisk
he contented himself with the Improvement of
that shall Pittance of Ground, which wads :i

D 2 t;-.-;

that the unhappy Prince Veridomer, my Grandfather,
was able to bequeath to him.

Hey-day ! cried Sir Charles, Will you new-christen
your Grandfather, when he has been
in his Grave these Forty Years ? I knew honest
Sir Edward Bellmour very well, though I
was but a Youth when he died but I believe
no Person in Kent ever gave him the
Title of Prince JFeridomer: Fie fie! these are
idle Brags.

Sir George, without taking Notice of the old
Baronet's Heat, went on with his Narration in
this manner:

Things were in this State, Madam, when I
was born. I will not trouble you with the
Relation of what I did in my Infancy.

No, pray skip over all that, interrupted Sir
Charles; I suppose your Infancy was like other
Peoples? What can there be worth hearing in
that?

You are deceived, Sir, said isabella: The
Infancy of illustrious Personages has always
something very extraordinary in it; and from
their childish Words and Actions there have
been often Presages drawn of their future
Greatness and Glory.

Not to disoblige Sir Charter, however, said
the young Prince of Kent, I will not repeat
many things, which I said and did in the first
Years of my Life, that those about me thought
very surprising; and from them prognosticated,
that very strange Accidents would befal
me.

1 have been a Witness of Come very unfavourable
Prognostic of you, said Sir Charles,

filling; for you was the mos unlucky bold
Spark, that ever I knew in my Life.

'Tis very certain, pursued Sir George, that the
Forwardness of my Spirit gave great Uneasiness
to my Father; who, being, as 1 said before, inclinable
to a peaceable and sedentary Life, endeavoured
as much as possible to repress that
Vivacity in my )imposition, which he feared
might involve me in dangerous Enterprizes.
The Pains he took in my Education, I recompensed
by a more than ordinary Docility;
and, before I was thirteen, performed all my
Exercises with a marvelous Grace; and, if I
may dare say so, was, at those early Years, the
Admiration and Wonder of all that saw me.

Lady Bella had some Reason to fear your
A1odelty, I find, said Sir Charles, singling; for,
methinks you really speak too slightly of your
Excellencies.

However that may be, refilled Sir George;
my Father saw these early Instances of a towering
Genius in me, with a Pleasure, chastened
by his Fears, that the Grandeur of my Courage
would lead me to attempt something for the
Recovery of that Kingdom, which was my
Due; and which might haply occasion his losing
me.

Possessed with these Thoughts, he carefully
avoided saying any thing to me concerning the
glorious Pretences, to which my Birth gave mea
Right; and often wished it had been possible
for him to conceal from me, that I was the
true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom of Kent;
a Circumstance he never chose to mention to

D 3 any

any Person, and would have been glad, if it
had always remained a Secret.

And so it was a Secret, interrupted Sir
Charles; for, till this Day, I never heard of it;
and it might frill have been a Secret, if you had
pleased; for nobody, I dare say, would fufpea
such a Thing; and very few, I believe, will
be inclined to think there is any thing in such
an improbable Tale.

Notwithstanding all my Father's Endeavours
to the contrary, Madam, pursued Sir George,
I cherished those towering Sentiments, the
Knowlege of my Birth inspired me with i and
it was not without the utmost Impatience, that
1 brooked the private Condition, to which I
found myself reduced.

Cruel Fate! would I sometimes cry; was it
not enough to deprive me of that Kingdom,
which is my Due, and, subject me to a mean,
and inglorious State; but, to make that Condition
infinitely more grievous, must thou give
me a Soul, towering above my abject Fortune
? A Soul, that cannot but disdain the bare
Submission, I must pay to those, who triumph
in the Spoils of my ruined House ? A Soul,
which sees nothing above its Hopes and expectations
? And, in fine, a Soul, that excites
me daily to attempt Things worthy of my
Birth, and those noble Sentiments I inherit
from my great Forefathers? Ah! pursued I,
unhappy Bellnour; what hinders thee from
making thyself known and acknowleged for
heat thou art ? What hinders thee from boldly
asserting thy just and natural Rights; and

from defying the Usurper, who detains them
from thee ? What hinders thee, I say ?

What ? Interrupted Sir Charles, why the
Fear of a Halter, I suppose: There is nothing
more easy than to answer that Question.

Such, Madam, said Sir George, were the
Thoughts, which continually disturbed my
Imagination; and, doubtless, they had not failed
to purl me on to fume hazardous Enterprize,
had not a fatal Passion interposed; and
by its sweet, but dangerous Allurements,
stifled for a while that Flame, which Ambition,
and the Love of Glory, kindled in my
Soul.

Sir George here pausing, and fixing his Eyes
with a melancholy Air on the Ground, as i'
prest with a tender Remembrance;

Mr. Glanville asked him, smiling, If the
Thoughts of poor Dolly disturbed him? Pray,
added he, give us the History of your sint,
Love, without any Mixture of Fable ; or shall
I take the Trouble off you ? For you know, I
am very well acquainted with your Affair with!
the pretty Milk-maid, and can tell it very succinctly.


'Tis true, Sir, said Sir George, sighing, .
cannot recall the Idea of Dorothea, into mrr
Remembrance, without some Pain: That fair,
but.unfaithfui Shepherdess, who first taught mc
to sigh, and repaid my Tenderness with the
blacked Infidelity; Yet I will endeavour to
compose myself, and go on with my Narration.


Be pleased to know then, Madam, pursued
Sir George, that having my Thoughts, in this

D 4 manner,.

manner, wholly employed with the Disasters
of my Family, Iliad arrived to my seventeenth
Year, without being sensible of the Power of
Love; but the Moment now arrived, which
was to prove fatal to my Liberty. Following
the Chace one Day with my Father, and some
ether Gentlemen, I happened to saga little behind
them; and, being taken up with ordinary
Reflections, I lost my Way, and wandered
a long time, without knowing or considering
whither I was going. Chance at last concluded
me to a pleasant Valley, surrounded
with Trees; and, being tired with riding, I
lighted, and tying my Horse to agree, walked
forward, with an Intention to repose myself a
l(w Moments under the Shade of one of those
Trees, that had attracted my Observation: But
while I was looking for the most convenient
solace, I (pied, at the Durance of some few
Yards from me, a Woman lying asleep upon
the Grass: Curiosity tempted me to go nearer
this Person; and, advancing softly, that I
might not disturb her, I got near enough to
have a View of her Person: But, ah! Heavens
! what Wonders did my Eyes encounter
in this View-the Age of this fair Sleeper
seemed not to exceed Sixteen; her Shape was
formed with the exaceRf Symmetry; ones her
Hands supported her Head; the other, as it
lay carelessly stretched at her Side, gave me an
Opportunity of admiring its admirable Colour
and Proportion: The thin Covering upon her
Neck discovered Part of its inimitable Beauty
to my Eyes; but her Face, her lovely Face,
fixed all my Attention.

Certain it is, Madam, that, out of this Company,
it would be hard to find any thing so
perfect, as what I now viewed. Her Complexion
was the purest White imaginable,
heightened by the inchanting Glow, which
dyed her fair Cheeks with a Colour like that
of a new-blown RoTe: Her Lips, formed with
the greatest Perfection, and of a deeper Red,
seemed to receive new Beauties from the Fragrance
of that Breath, that parted from them:
Her auburn Hair fell in loose Ringlets over her
Neck; and rome straggling Curls, that played
upon her fair Forehead, set off by a charming
Contracts the Witness of that Skin it partly
hid : Her Eyes indeed were closed; and though
I knew not whether their Colour and Beauty
were equal to those other Miracles in her Face,
yet their Proportion seemed to be large; and
the snowy Lids, which covered them, were
admirably set off by those long and sable Lashes
that adorned them.

For rome Moments I gazed upon this lovely
Sleeper, wholly lost in Wonder and Admiration.


Where, whispered I, where has this Miracle
been concealed, that my Eyes were never blessed
with the Sight of her before ? There Words,
though I uttered them softly, and with the
utmost Caution; yet by the murmuring Noise
they made, caused an Emotion in the beauteous
Sleeper, that she started, and presently after
opened her Eyes: But what Words shall I find
to express the Wonder, the Astonishment, and
Rapture, which the Sight of those blight Stars
inspired me with ? The Flames which darted

D 5 from

from those glorious Orbs, caRl such a dazling
Splendor upon a Sight too weak to bear a
Radiance so Unusual, that, stepping back a few
Spaces, I contemplated at a Distance, that
Brightness, which began already to kindle a
consuming Fire in my Soul.

Bless me! interrupted Sir Charles, confounded
at so pompous a Description i who
could this be?

The pretty Milk-maid, Dolly Acorn, replied
Mr. Glanville gravely : Did you never see her,
Sir, when you was at your Seat, at ?
She used often to bring Cream to my Lady.

Aye, aye, replied Sir Charles, I remember
her: She was a very pretty Girl: And so it was
from her Eyes, that all those Splendors and
Flames came, that had like to have burnt you
up, Sir George: Well, well, I guess how the
Story will end: Pray let us hear it out.

I have already told you, Madam, resumed
Sir George, the marvelous Effeas the Sight of
those bright Eyes produced upon my Spirit: I
remained fixed in a Posture of Astonishment
and Delight; and all the Faculties of my Soul
were so absorbed in the Contemplation of the
Miracles before me, that I believe, had Ihe
Still continued before my Eyes, I should never
have moved from the Place where I then stood:
But the fair Virgin, who had spied me at the
small Distance to which I was retired, turned
hastily about, and flew away with extraordinary
Swiftness.

When Love, now lending me Wings, whom
Admiration had before made motionless, I persued
her so eagerly, that at last I overtook her;

and, throwing myself upon my Knees before
her,

Stay, I conjure you, cried I; and if you bea
Divinity, as your celestial Beauty makes me
believe, do not refuse the Adoration I offer
you : But if, as I most ardently wish, you area
Mortal, though sure the fairest that ever
graced the Earth; flop a Moment, to
a Man, whose Repeat for you as a Mortal
fall little short of those Adorations he offers
you as a Goddess.

I can't but think, cried Sir Charles, laughing
how poor Dolly must be surprised at such a rhodomontade
Speech !'

Oh, Sir! replied Mr. Glanville, you will
find Ihe will make as good a one.

Will she, by my Troth, said Sir Charles. I
don't know how to believe it.

This Ation, pursued Sir Gkorg!, and te
Words I uttered, a little surprised that lair
Maid, and brought a Blush into her love's
Cheeks; but, recovering herself, fie replied
with an admirable Grace,

I am no Divinity, said she; and therefore
your Adorations are misplaced; But if, as you
lay, my Countenance moves you to any respect
for me,. give me a Proof of it, by not
endeavouring to hold. any further Discourse
with me, which is not permitted me from ones
of your Sex and Appearance.

A very wise Answer, indeed ! interrupted
Sir Charles again: Very few Town Ladies
would have disclaimed the Title of Goddess, if
their Lovers had thought proper to bestow it

D.-6 u born

upon them. I am mightily pleased with the Girl
for her Ingenuity.

The Discretion of so young a Damsel, resumed
Sir George, charmed me no less than her
Beauty; and I besought her, with the utmost
Earnestness, to permit me a longer Conversation
with her.

Fear not, lovely Virgin, said I, to lilfen to
tile Vows of a Man, who, till he saw you,
never learnt to sigh: My Heart, which defended
its Liberty against the Charms of many
admirable Ladies, yields, without Reluctance,
to the pleasing Violence your Beauties lay
ripon me. Yes, too charming and dangerous
Stranger, I am no longer my own Mater: It
is in your Power to dispose of my Destiny:
Consider therefore, Beseech you, whether you
can consent to see me die? For I swear to
you, by the most sacred Oaths, unless you promise
to have some Compassion on me, I will
no longer behold the Light of Day.

You may easily conceive, Madam, that, considering
this. lovely Maid in the Character of
a Shepherdess, in which the appeared, I made
her a Declaration of my Passion, without thinking
myself obliged to observe those Respects,
which, to person of equal Rank with myself,
Decorum would not have permitted me to. forget.


However, she repelled my Boldness with
so charming a Modesty, that I began to believe,
she might be a Person of illustrious Birth,
disguised under the mean Habit The wore: But,
having requested her to inform me who the was,
she told me, her Name was Dorothea; and that

the was Daughter to a Farmer, that lived in
the neighbouring Valley. This Knowlege increasing
my Confidence, I talked to her of my
Passion, without being the least afraid of offending
her.

And therein you was greatly to blame, said
Arabella: For, truly, though the fair Dorothea
told you, she was Daughter to a Farmer; yet,
in all Probability, the was of a much higher
Extraction, if the Picture you have drawn of
her be true.

The fair A.rfinoe, Princess of Armenia, was
constrained for a while to conceal her true
Name and Quality, and pass for a simple
Country-woman, under the Name of Delia:
Yet the generous Philadelphia, Prince of Cilicia,
who saw and loved her under that Disguise,
treated her with all the Respect he would have
done, had he known she was the Daughter of a
King. In like manner, Prince Phillips, who
fell in Love with the beautiful Policrete, before
he knew she was the Daughter of the great
Solon; and while he looked upon her as a poor
Stranger, born of mean Parents ; nevertheless,
his Love supplying the Want of those Advantages
of Birth and Fortune, he wooed her with
a Passion as full of Awe and Delicacy, as if her
Extraction had been equal to his own. And
therefore those admirable Qualities the fair
Dorothea possessed, might also have convinced
you, she was not what she seemed, but, haply,
some great Princess in Disguise.

To tell ygu the Truth, Madam, replied Sir
George, notwithstanding the fair Dorothea informed
me, the was of a mean Descent, I could

not easily forego the Opinion, that the was of
an illustrious Birth : And the Histories of those
fair Princesses you have mentioned, coming into
my Mind, I also thought it very possible,
that this divine Person might either be the
Daughter of a great King, or Lawgiver, like
them; but, being wholly engrossed by the Violence
of my new-born Affection, I listened to
nothing, but what most flattered my Hopes;
and, addressing my lovely Shepherdess with all
the Freedom of a Person who thinks his Birth
much superior to hers; the listened to my protestations,
without any teeming Reluctance,
and condescended to assure me before we parted,
that lie did not hate me. So fair a Beginning,
seemed to promise me the most favourable
Fortune I could with Reason expeac. I
parted from my fair Shepherdess with a thousand
Vows of Fidelity; exacting a Promise from
her, that she would meet me as often as the
conveniently could, and have the Goodness to
listen to those Assurances of inviolable Tenderness
my Passion prompted me to offer her.
When she left me, it seemed as if my Soul had
forsaken my Body to go after her: My E es
pursued her Steps as long as the was in Sight; I
envied the Ground she prest as she went along,
and the Breezes that kissed that celestial.
Countenance in their Flight.

For tome Hours 1 flood in the same Posture
in which she had left me; contemplating the
sudden Change I had experienced in my Heart,
and the Beauty of that divine Image, which
was now engraved in it. Night drawing on, I
began to thinks going home; and, untying my

Horse, I returned the Way I had come; and
at last struck into a Road, which brought me
to the Place where I parted from the Company;
from whence I easily found my Way home,
so changed both in my Looks and Carriage,
that my Father, and all my Friends, observed
the Alteration with some Surprize.

C H A P. II.
In which Sir George, continuing his surprising

History, relates a ;novi stupendous
Instance of a Valour only to be parallelled
by that of the great Oroondates,
Caesarea, &c. &c. &c.

O R some Months, continued Sir George,
I prosecuted my Addresses to the admirable
Dorothea ; and I flattered myself with a
Hope, that I had made some Progress in her
Heart: But, alas! this deceitful Fair-one, who
only laughed at the Torments she made me endure,
at the time she vowed eternal Constancy
to me, gave her Hand to a Lover of her Father's
providing, and abandoned me, without
Remorse, to the most cruel Despair.

I will not trouble you, Madam, with the
Repetition of those Complaints, which this
perfidious Action drew from me for a long time.
At length, my Courage enabling me to overcome
the Violence of my Grief, I resolved to
think of the ungrateful Dorothea no more; and

the Sight of another Beauty completing my
Cure, I no longer remembred the unfaithful
Shepherdess, but with Indifference.

'lThus, Madam, have I faithfully related one
of those Infidelities, wherewith my Enemies
finder me ; who can support their Assertion,
with no better Proof, than that I did not die,
when Dorothea abandoned me: But I submit
it to your Candour, whether an unfaithful
Mistress deserved such an Instance of Assertion,
from a Lover she had betrayed ?

Why, really, replied Arabella, after a little
Pause, you had some Excuse to plead for your
Failure in this Point: And though you cannot
be called, the most persia amongst Lovers,
seeing you neither died, nor was in Danger of
dying; yet neither ought you to be ranked
among those who are moR culpable: But pray
proceed in your Story: .1 stall be better able to.
form a right Judgment of your Merit as a Lover,
when 1 have heard all your Adventures.

My Passion for Dorothea, resumed Sir George;.
being cured by her Treachery towards me,
the Love of Glory began again to revive in my
Soul. I panted after some Occasion to signalise
my Valour, which yet I had met with no
Opportunity of doing; but, hearing that a
mighty Army was preparing to march upon a
secret Expedition, I privately quitted my Father's
Seat; and, attended only by my faithful
'Squire, I took the same Route the Army had
taken, and arrived the Day before the terrible
Battle of - was fought, where, without
making myself known, I performed such prodigies
of Valour, as astonished all who beheld

me. Without doubt, Should have been highly
caressed by the Commander, who certainly
would have given me the Honour of a Victory
my Sword alone had procured for him; but,
having unwittingly engaged myself too far in
Pursuit of the flying Enemy, I found myf)elt
alone, encompassed with a Party of about Five
hundred Men ; who, seeing they were pursued
only by a single Man, faced about, and prepared
to kill or take me Prisoner.

Pray, Sir, interrupted Sir Charles, when did
all this happen ? And how came it to pass, that
your Friends have been ignorant to this Moment
of those Prodigies of Valour you performed
at that Battle ? I never heard you was
ever in a Battle: Fame has done you great injustice,
by concealing the Part you had in that
famous Viaory.

The great Care I took to conceal myself,
replied Sir George, was one Reason why my
Friends did not attribute to me the Exploits,
which the Knight in black Armour, who was
no other than myself, performed ; and the Accident
I am going to relate, prevented my being
discovered, while the Memory of those
great Exploits were yet fresh in the Minds of
those I had so greatly obliged.

Be pleased to know, therefore, Madam, that,
seeing myself about to be encompassed by this
Party of the Enemy, I disdained to fly; and,
though I was alone, resolved to sustain their
Attack, and sell my Life as dear as possible.

Why, if you did so, you was a Madman,
cried Sir Charles in a Heat: The bravest Man
that ever lived, would not have presumed to

fight with so great a Number of Enemies. What
could you expect, but to be cut in Pieces?
Pooh ! pooh ! don't think any body will credit
such a ridiculous Tale: I never knew you was
so addled to-lying,

perhaps, the good Knight would have
said; but Sir George, who was concerned he
was present at his Legend, and could not
blame him for doubting his Veracity, prevented
his Utterance of a Word he would be obliged
to take ill, by abruptly going on with his
Story.

Placing my Back therefore against a Tree,
pursued he, to prevent my beingaffaulted behind,
I presented my Shield to the Boldest of
these Assailants; who, having struck an impotent
Blow upon it, as he was lifting up his Arm
to renew his Attack, I cut it off with one
Stroke of my Sword; and the same Instant
plunged it to the Hilt in the Breast of another,
and clove the Scull of a Third, who was making
at me, in two Parts.

Sir Charles, at this Relation, burst into a
loud Fit of Laughter; and, being more inclined
to divert himself, than be offended at the Folly
and Vanity of the young Baronet, he permitted
him to go on with his surprising Story, without
giving him any other Interruption.

These Three Executions, Madam, pursued
Sir George, were the Effects only of so many
Blows; which raised such Indignation in my
Enemies-that they prest forward in great Numbers
to destroy me; but, having, as I before
said, ported myself so advantageously, that I
could only be assaulted before, not more than

Three or Four could attack meat one time. The
Desire of lengthening out my Life, till happily
some Succour might come to my Relief, so invigorated
my Arm, and added to my ordinary
Strength an almost irresistible Force, that I dealt
Death at every Blow; and in less than a quarter
of an Hour, saw more than Fifty of my
Enemies at my Feet, whore Bodies served for a
Bulwark against their Fellows Swords.

The Commander of this little Body, not
having Generosity enough to be moved with
those prodigious Effets of my Valour in my
Favour, was transported with Rage at my resistance;
and the Sight of so many of his Men
slain before his Face, served only to increase
his Fury ; and that Moment, seeing, that, with
Two more Blows, I had sent Two of his most
valiant Soldiers to the Shades, and that the rest
fearing to come within the Length of my
Sword, had given me a few Moments Respite,


Ah ! Cowards! cried he, are you afraid of
a single Man ? And will you sussex him to
escape from your Vengeance, who has slain so
many of your brave Comrades before your
Eyes ?

There Words inspiring them with a Fierceness,
such as he desired, they advanced towards
me with more Fury than before : By this time,
I had received several large Wounds, and my
Blood ran down from many Parts of my Body:
Yet was I not sensible of any Decay of Strength,
nor did the fettled Designs of my Enemies to
destroy me daunt me in the leat : Still relied
upon the Assistance I expected Providence

would send to my Relief, and determined, if
possible, to preserve my Life, till it arrived.

I sought, therefore, with a Resolution, which
astonished my Enemies, but did not move them
to any Regard for my Safety: And, observing
their brutal Commander, a few Paces from me,
encouraging his Men, both with his Cries and
Gestures, Indignation against this inhuman
Wretch so transported me out of my Discretion,
that I quitted my Posh, in order to sacrifice
him to my Revenge.

Seeing me advance furiously towards him, he
turned pale with Fear, and endeavoured to shelter
himself in the midst of his Men; who, more
valiant than himself, opposed themselves to my
Rage, to favour his Retreat: But quickly clearing
myself a WVay with my Sword, I pressed towards
the barbarous Coward; and, ere he could
avoid the Blow I aimed at him, it struck him
senseless at my Feet.

My particular Revenge thus satisfied, I was
sensible of the Fault I had committed in quitting
my Post, by which I exposed myself to be
surrounded by the Enemy. I endeavoured to
regain it, but in vain: I was beset on all Sides,
and now despaired of any Safety; and therefore
only sought to die courageously, and niake
as many of my Enemies as I could, attend
my Fall.

Exasperated by the Misfortune of their Commander,
they pressed upon me with redoubled
Fury. Faint as I was, with the Loss of Blood,
and so fatigued with the past Action, and the
obstinate Fight I had maintained so long with
'such a considerable Number, I could hardly any

longer lift up my Arm; and, to complete, my
Misfortune, having thrust my Sword into the
Body of one of the forwarded of my Enemies,
in my endeavouring to regain it, it broke in
Pieces, and theist only remained in my Hand.

This Accident completed my Defeat: Deprived
of my Sword, I was no longer capable
of making any Defence: Several of them pressed
upon me atone; and, throwing me down,
tied my Hands together behind me. Shame and
Rage at this Indignity worked so forcibly upon
my Spirits, weakened as I then was, that I
fell into a Swoon. What happened till my Recovery,
I am not able to tell; but, at the Return
of my Senses, I found myself laid on a
Bed in a tolerable Chamber, and some Persons
with me, who kept a profound Silence.

C H A P. III.
A Love-Adventure, after the Romantic

RECOLLECTING in a few Moments

all that happened to me, I could not
choose but be surprised at finding myself
treated with so little Severity, considering I
was Prisoner to Persons who had been witnesses
of the great Quantity of Blood I had
shed in my own Defence. My Wounds had
been.dreffed while I continued in my Swoon;
and the Faces of those Persons who were about
me, expressed nothing of Unkindness.

After reflecting some time longer on my
Situation, I called to a young Man, who sat
near my Bed-side, and intreated him to inform
me, Where I was, and to whom I was a Prisoner
? But could get no other Answer to those
Questions, than a most civil Intreaty to compose
myself, and not protract the Cure of my
Wounds by talking, which, the Surgeons had
declared, would be of a bad Consequence;
and had therefore ordered me to be as little
disturbed as possible.

Notwithstanding this Remonstrance, I repeated
my Request, promising to be entirely
governed by them for the future in what regarded
my Health, provided they would satisfy
me in those Particulars: But my Attendant did
not so much as reply to those Importunities;
but, to prevent the Continuance of them, rose
from his Seat, and retired to the other End of
the Chamber.

I passed that Day, and several others, without
being able to learn the Truth of my Condition:
All this time, I was diligently waited on
by the two Persons I had first seen, neither
of whom I could prevail upon to inform me
of what I desired to know ; and, judging, by
this obstinate Reserve, and the Manner of my
Treatment, thatcher was rome Mystery in
the Case, I forbore to ask them any more
Questions, conceiving they had particular Orders
not to answer them.

The Care that was taken to forward my
Cure, in Three Weeks entirely restored me
to Health: I longed impatiently to know,
what was to be my Destiny; and busied myself

in conjecturing it, in vain; when, one Morning,
an elderly Lady entered my Chamber, at whose
Appearance my Two Attendants retired.

After she had saluted me very civilly, and
inquired after my Health, she seated herself ina
Chair near my Bedside, and spoke to me in
this manner:

I make no question, Sir, but you are surprised
at the Manner in which you have been
treated, and the Care there has been taken to
prevent discovering to you the Place where
you now are; but you will doubtless be more
surprised, to hear you are in the Fortress of -,
and in the House of Prince Marcomire, whose
Party you fought against alone; and whom
you so dangerously wounded, before you was
taken Prisoner by his Men.

Is it possible, Madam, said I, who, from
the first Moment of her Appearance, had been
in a strange Perplexity, is it possible, I am in
the House of a Man, whose Life I endeavoured
so eagerly to destroy? And is it to him, who
oppressed me so bally with Numbers, that I
am obliged for the Succour I have received ?

It is not to him, replied the Lady, that you
are obliged for the favourable Treatment you
have had; but listen to me patiently, and I
will disclose the Truth of your Adventure.

Prince Maronite, who was the Person that
headed that Party against which you so valiantly
defended yourself, after the Loss of the
Battle, was hastening to throw himself into
this Place, where his Sister, and many Ladies
of Quality, had come for Security: Your indiscreet

Pursuit engaged you in the most unequal
Combat that ever was fought; and-nay,

Sir, interrupted Arabella, though I do
not refuse to give you all the Praises your gallant
Defence of yourself against Five hundred
Men deserves; yet I cannot agree with that
Lady, in saying, it was the most unequal Combat
that ever was sought: For, do but reflect, I
beseech you, upon that'which the brave Prince
mauritania stained against twice that Number
of Men, with no other Arms than his
Sword; and, you having been in Battle that
Day, was, as I conceive, completely armed.
The young Prince of Egypt, accompanied only
by the valiant, but indiscreet, Cep;o his Friend,
engaged all the King of Armenia's Guards,
and put them all to Flight. The courageous
Ariobafanes scorned to turn his Back upon a
whole Army; not to mention the invincible
Artaban, whom a thousand Armies together
could not have made to turn.

Pleased to obferve,Madam, said Sir George,
that to the end I may faithfully recount my
History, I am under a Necessity of repeating
Things, which, haply, may seem too advantageous
for a Man to say of himself: Therefore
I indeed greatly approve of the Custom, which,
no doubt, this Inconveniency introduced, of a
'Squire, who is thoroughly instructed with the
Secrets of his Master's Heart, relating his Adventures,
and giving a proper Eulogium of his
rare Valour, without being in Danger of offending
the Modesty of the renowned Knight;
who, as you know, Madam, upon those occasions,
commodiously ships away.

It being, however, this Lady's Opinion, that
no Man ever undertook a more hazardous Combat,
or with greater Odds, against him, the did
not fail to express her Admiration of it, in very
high Terms.

The Noise of this Accident, pursued she,
was soon spread over the whole Town; and
the beautiful Sydiniris,Marcormre's Sister, hearing
that her Brother was wounded, as it was
thought to Death, and that the Person who
killed him, was taken Prisoner; she flew out
to meet her wounded Brother, distracted with
Grief, and vowing to have the severest Tortures
executed on him, who had thus barbarously
murdered her Brother. Those who bore
that unhappy Prince, having brought him into
the House, his Wounds were searched ; and
the Surgeons declared, they were very dangerous.


Sydimiris, hearing this, redoubled her Complaints
and Vows of Vengeance against you:
Her Brother having then the chief Authority in
the Place, the commanded, in his Name, to
have you brought hither, and to be most trial
guarded ; determined, if her Brother died, to
sacrifice you to his Ghost.

Full of there sanguinary Resolutions, she
left his Chamber, having seen him laid in Bed;
and his Wounds dressed ; but passing along a
Gallery to her own Apartment, she met the
Persons who were bringing you to the Room
that was to be your Prison : You was not, pursued
heady, yet recovered from yourSwoon,
so that they carried you like one that was dead:
They had taken off your Helmet to give you

VOL. II. ¬£ Air i

Air; by which means your Face being quite
uncovered, pale, languishing, and your Eves
closed, as if in Death, presented the molt
moving, and, at the same time, moth pleasing
Objet in the World.

Sydimiiris, who stopt, and fur a Moment
eagerly gazed upon you, lost all of a sudden
the Fierceness, which before had animated her
against you: And lifting up her Eyes to view
those Men that carried you;

Are you sure, said the to them, that this is
the Person who wounded my Brother ?

Yes, Madam, replied one of them; this must
be he, since there was no other in his Company;
and he alone sustained the Attack of Five
hundred Men; and would probably not have
left one of them alive, had not his Sword, by
breaking, put it into our Power to take him
Prisoner.

Carry him away, said Sydiiniris; but let his
Wounds be dressed, and let him be carefully
looked to, that, if my Brother dies, he maybe
punished as he deserves.

Pronouncing these Words in a low and faltering
Voice, she turned her Eyes a second time
upon you; then, hastily averting her Looks,
flie hurried to her own Chamber, and threw
herself into a Chair, with all the Marks of a
very great Disturbance.

The. Affection I have for her, being the Person
who had brought her up, and molt favoured
with her Confidence, made me behold her in
this Condition with great Concern; and supposing
it was her Brother that disquieted her,,
I besought her not to give way to the Violence

of her Grief, but to hope that Heaven would
restore him to her Prayers.

Alas ! my dear Ironic, said fie, I am more
culpable than you can imagine; and I grieve Its
for the Condition to which I see AIarcoirc reduced,
than for that Moderation wherewith I
am constrained, spite of myself, to behold his
Enemy.

Yes, dear Urinoc, pursued she, blushing-and
casting down her Eyes, the Actions of
this Unknown appear to me in quite another
Light, since I have seen him ; and, instead of
looking upon him as the Murderer of my Brother,
I cannot help admiring that rare Valour.
with which he defended himfclfagainft so great
a Number of Enemies; and am even ready to
condemn the furious AlIarcomirc, for oppressing
so brave a Man.

As I had never approved of those violent
Transports of Grief and Rage, which file had
expressed upon the first News of her Brother's
Misfortune; and as I looked upon ,your glorious
Defence with the utmost Admiration; sofar
from condemning the Change of her
Thoughts, I confirmed her in the favourable
Opinion she began to entertain of you; and,
continuing to make Remarks upon all the Particulars
of the Combat, which had come to
our Knowlege, we found nothing in your Behaviour,
but what increased our Admiration.

Sydimiris therefore, following the Dictates
of her own Generosity, as well as my Advice,
placed Two Persons about you, whose Side.
city we could rely on; and gave them Orders
to treat you with all imaginable Care and Rc-

1E 2 sicca,

feet, but not to inform you of the Place in
which you was, or to whormi you was Prisoner.


In the mean time, Marcomire, whose
Wounds had been again examined, was declared
out of Danger by the Surgeons; and he
having understood the Excess of his Sister's
Grief, and the Revenge file had vowed against
you, gave her Thanks for those Expressions of
her Tenderness; and also uttered Ime Threats,
which intimated a violent Hatred against you;
and a Design of prosecuting his Revenge upon
you, as soon as he was in a Condition to leave
his Chamber.

Sydimiris, who heard him, could with Difficulty
dissemble her Concern.

Ah ! Urinoe, said [he to me, when we were
alone; 'tis now, that I more than ever repent
of that Excess of Rage, which transported me
against the brave Unknown. I have thereby
p;t him intirely into my Brother's Power, and
shall be haply accessory to that Death he is
meditating for hire, or else a perpetual Imprisonment.


This Reflection gave her so much Pain, that
I could not choose but pity her; and considering,
that the only way to preserve you, was
for her to dissemble a Rage equal to Mar-contre's
against you, in order to prevent being
lulfp)eed of any Design in your Favour, I persisted
her to join with him in every thing he
said ; while, in the mean time, we would endeavour
to get you cured of your Wounds, that
you might at least he in a Condition once more

to defend yourself with that miraculous Valour
Heaven has bestowed on you.

Sydimi-ir perceiving her Brother would loon
be in a Condition to execute his Threats, resolved
to hazard every thing, rather than to expose
you to his Rage; She therefore communicated
to me her Design of giving you Liberty, and,
by presenting a sufficient Reward to your
Guard, inducing them to favour )our Escape.

I undertook to manage this Business in her
Name, and have done it so effectually, that
you will this Night be at Liberty, and may
depart the Town immediately, in which it will
be dangerous to stay any time, for fear of
being discovered.

Sydimiris sorbad me to let you know the
Person to whom you would be obliged for your
Freedom; but I could not endure, that you
should unjustly involve the Sister of Marcomirc,
in that Resentment you will questionless alma) 3
preserve against him ; and to keep you from being
innocently guilty of Ingratitude, I resolved to
acquaint you with the Nature of thole Obligations
you owe to her.

C H A P. IV.
The Adventure continued.
A 1l! Madam, said I, perceiving flie had

finished her Discourse, doubt not but I
shall most gratefully preserve the Remembrance
of what the generous Sydimiris has dolly for me;

E 3 aid

and shall always be ready to lore that Life in
her Defence, which file has had the superlative
Goodness to take so much Care of. But, Madam,
pursued 1, with an earnest Look, do not,
I beseech you, refuse me one Favour, without
which I shall' depart with inconceivable Sorrow.

Depend upon it, valiant Sir, replied file,
that if what you will require of me, be in my
Power, and fit for me to grant, I hall very
willingly oblige you.

It is then, returned I, trembling at the Boldness
of my Request, that you would condescend
to intreat the molt generous Sydmirins to.
favour me with an Interview, and give me an
Opportunity of throwing myself at her Feet,.
to thank her for all those Favours I have received
from her Compassion.

I cannot promise you, replied the Lady,
riling, to prevail upon Sydimiris to grant you an.
Audience; but I assure you, that I will endeavour
to dispose her to do you this Favour; and
it shall not be my Fault, if you are not satisfied.


Saying this, the went out of my Chamber,,
I having followed her to the Door, with protestations
that I would never forget her Kindness
upon this Occasion.

I pitt the rest of that Day in an anxious Impatience
for Night, divided between Fear and
Hope, and more taken up with the Thoughts
of seeing Sjdimiris, than with my expected
.liberty. Night came at last, and the Door of my
Apartment opening, I saw the Lady who had
been with me in the Morning, enter.

I have prevailed upon Sydimiris to fe you,
said the; and the is willing, at my Intreaty, to
grant that Favour to a Person, who, fie with
Reason thinks, has been inhumanly treated by
her Brother.

Then, giving me her Hand, she conducted
me along a large Gallery, to a (lately Apartment;
and after traversing several Rooms, the
led me into one, where Sydimiris herself was:
Who, as boon as Lie perceived me, rose from
her Seat, and received me with great Civility.

In the Transport I then was, I know not
how I returned the grateful Salute the incomparable
Sydimiris. gave me; for most certain
it is, that I was so lost in Wonder, at the Sight
of the many Charms I beheld in her Person,
that I could not unlock my Tongue, or remove
my Eyes from her inchanting Face but
remained fixed in a Poflure, which at once expressed
my Admiration and Delight.

To give you a Description of that Beauty
which I then contemplated, I must inform
you, Madam, that Sydiminis is tall, of a handsome
Stature, and admirably proportioned ; her
Hair was of the finet Black in the World; her
Complexion marvelously fair; and all the lineaments
of her Visage were .perfectly beautiful;
and her Eves, which were large and black,
sparkled with so quick and piercing a Fire, that
no Heart was able to relic their powerful
Glances: Moreover, Sydl;inziris is admirably
shaped; her Port is high and noble; and leer
Air so free, yet so commanding, that there are
few Persons in the World, with whom flie mai
not dispute the Priority of Beauty: In fine,

E 4 Madam,

Madam, Sydimirls appeared with so many Advantages,
to a Spirit prepossessed already with
the moth grateful Sense of her Favours, that
I could not refill the sweet Violence wherewith
her Charms took Possession of my Heart: I
yielded therefore, without Reluctance, to my
Destiny, and resigned thyself, in an Instant, to
thoinr Fetters, which the Sight of the Divine
di iltiiris prepared for me: Recovering therefore
a little from that Admiration, which
had so totally ingrained all my Faculties, I
threw myself at her Feet, with an Action wholly
comnpolid of Transport.

Divine S nimis, said I, beholding her with
Eyes, in which the Letters of my new-born
P.,iTinn might very plainly be read, see at
your Feet a Man devoted to your Service, by
all the Ties of Gratitude and RefpeO. I come,
Madam, to declare to you, that from the First
Moment you gave me Liberty, I had devoted
that and my Life to you ; and at your Feet I
confirm the Gift; protesting by all that is mot
dear and sacred to me, that since I hold my
Life from the Divine Sydiminis, she alone fla,
have the absolute Disposal of it for the future;
and should the please again to demand it, either
to appease her Brother's Fury, or to sacrifice
it to her own Security, I will most faithfully
perform her Will, and shed the lait Drop of
that Blood at her Command, which I would
with Transport lose in her Defence.

A fine high-flown Speech indeed ! said Sir
Charles, laughing; but I hope you did not intend
to keep your Word.

Sure, Sir, replied Isabella, you do not imagine,
that Sir George would have failed in
executing all he had promised to the beautiful
and generous Sydimiris: What could he possibly
have said leis ? And indeed what less could
the have expected from a Man, whom at the
Hazard of her own Life and Happiness, flie hid
given Freedom to ?

I accompanied there Words, Madam, pur-filed
Sir George, with so passionate a Look and
Accent, that the fair Sydim!iris blushed, and,
for a Moment, call down her Eyes with ai
visible Confusion. At lft,

Sir, replied she, I am too well ratified with
what 1 have done, with respect to your Safety,
to require any Proofs of your Gratitude, that
might be dangerous to it; ,and shall remain extremely
well'fatisfied, if the Obligations you
think. you.owe me, nay induce you to moderate
your Resentment against my Brother, ft'u5
the cruel Treatment you received from him.

Doubt not, Madam, interrupted I, eagerly,
but I shall, in the 'Pcron of ilarcomnire, regard
the Brother of the divine Sydimiris; and ia;
Consideration will be sufficient, not only to
make me forget all the Violences lie committed
against me, but even to defend his Life, if need
be, with the Hazard of my own.

Excessively generous indeed ! said Sir CIrarlcs:.
I never heard any thing like it.

Oh 1 dear, Sir, replied Arabella, there are
numberless Instances of equal, and even superior
Generosity, to be met with in the L.vsb of
tile Heroes ot Antiquity: You will tal.r see
ia Luutr, whose iV.liurtris has uen skein front

E; 5 hniin

him, cither by Treachery or Force, venture
his Life in Defence of the injurious Husband
who possesses her; and though all his Felicity
depends upon his Death, yet he will rescue him
from it, at the Expence of the greater Part of
his Blood.

Another, who after a long and bloody War,
has, by taking his Enemy P' ifoner, an Opportunity
of terminating it honourably ; yet, thro'
an heroick Principle of Generosity, lie gives
his Captive Liberty, without making any Conditions,
and has all his Work to do over again.

A Third, having contracted a violent Friendship
with the Enemies of his County, through
tie same generous Sentiments, draws his Sword
in their Defence, and makes no Scruple to fight
.gainst an Army, where the King his Father
is in Person.

I must confers, said Sir Charles, that Gene.
rolitv firms to me very peculiar, that will make
a Man fight for his Enemies against his own
Father.

It is in that Peculiarity, Sir, said Arabella,
that his Generosity consists; for certainly there
is nothing extraordinary in fighting for one's
Father, and one's Country ; but when a Man
has arrived to such a Pitch of Greatness of
Sou!: a; to neglect those mean and selfish considerations,
and, loving Virtue in the Persons
of his Enemies, can prefer their Glory before
hrs own particular Interest, he is then a perfect
Hero indeed: Such a one was Oroondates, Ar.
tce'xcrxe, and many others I could name, who
all gave eminent Proofs of their Disinterested.
rcfil and Greatness of Soul, upon the like occasions:

Therefore not, to detract from Sir
George's Merit, I must Still insist, that in the
Resolutions he had taken to defend his Enemy's
Life at the Expence of his own, he did
no more, than what any Man of ordinary generosity
ought to do, and what he was particularly
obli-ed to, by what the amiable Sydmlr-is
had done I'r him.

Was so happy, however, Madam, continued
Sir George, to find that those Expressions of my
Gratitude wrought somewhat upon the Heart
of the lovely Sydlimiris in m I Favour: Her
Words discovered as much, and her Eyes spoke
yet more intelligible) ; but our Conversation was
interrupted by the. ilcfreet Urinoc, who, fearing
the Consequence cf so long a Stay in her Chamber,
represented to me, that it was time to
take my Leave.

I turned pale at this cruel Sound; and, bec
holding Sydlmnris with a languishing Look,

Would to Heaven, Madam, said I, that
instead of giving me Liberty, you would keep
me eternally your Prisoner; for though a Dungeon
was to be the Place of my Confinement,
yet if it was near you, it would seem a Palace
to me; for indeed I am no longer in a Condition
to relish that Freedom you bestow upon
me, since it must remove me farther from you
But I beseech you, Madam, to believe, that in
delivering me from your Brother's Fetters, you
have cast me into your-own, and that I am morea
Prisoner than ever, but a Prisoner to so lovely
a Conqueror, that I do not with to break airy
Chains, and prefer the sweet and glorious Cape

6 X'ity

activity I am in, to all the Crowns in the
World.

You are very bold, said Srydir;iis, blushing,
to entertain me with fitch Discourse ; yet I
pardon this Offence, in Consideration of what
sou have suffered from my Brother, and on
Condition that you will depart immediately,
without speaking another Word.

Sydimiris spoke this so earnestly, that I curs
not disobey her; and, kissing the Hem of her
Robe, with a passionate Air, I left ber Chamber,
conduced by Urinoa; who having brought
me to a private Door, which can hed us into
the Street, I there found a Man waiting forme,
whom I knew to be the same that had
attended me during my Stay in that House.

Urinoe having recommended to him to see
me safe out of the Town, I took Leave of
her, with the mos grateful Acknowlegements
for her Kindness; and followed my Conductor,
to oppressed with Grief at the Thoughts of
leaving the Place where Sydimiris was, that I
had hardly Strength to walk.

An extraordinary Instance of Generosity ina

Lover, somewhat resembling that of the
great Artaxerxes, in Cassandra.

HI E farther I went, continued Sir George,
T the more my Regret increased ; and,
fitting it would be impossible to live, and quit

the Divine Sydimiiris, I all at once took a resolution
to remain in the Town concealed ; and,
communicating my Design to my Guide, I engaged
him to assist me in it, by a Present of a
considerable Sum, which he could not refit :
Accordingly he left me in a remote Part of the
Town, and went to find out a convenient Lodging
for me; which he soon procured, and also
a Suit of Cloaths to disguise me, my own being
very rich and magnificent.

Having recommended me as a Relation of
his, who was newly arrived, I was received
very civilly by the People with whom he placed
me; and, finding this young Man to be very
witty and discreet, and also very capable of
serving me, I communicated to him my Intentions
by saying, which were only to be near
the Divine Sydimiris, and to have the Happiness
of sometimes seeing her, when she went
abroad.

This Man entering into my Meaning, assures
me, he would faithfully keep my Secret; and
that he would not fail to bring me Intelligence
of all that passed in the Palace of l'Iarcomire.

I could with Difficulty keep myself from
falling at his Feet, to express my Sense of his
kind and generous Offers; but I contented
myself with presenting him another Sum of
Money, larger than the first, and assured him
of my future Gratitude.

He then took Leave, and left me to my reflections,
which were wholly upon the Image
of the Divine Sydimiris, ant the Happiness of
being so real the Objet I adored.

My Confident came to me the next Day;
but brought me no other News, than that my
Escape was not yet known to Marcomire. I
inquired if he had seen Sydimniri s; but he replied
he had not, and that Urine had only
asked him, if he had conducted me safe out of
Town: To which he had answered as we had
agreed, that I had got out safe and undiscovered.


A Day or two after, he brought me News
more pleasing ; for he told me, that Sydimri-i
had sent for him into her Chamber, and asked
him several Questions concerning me: That
file appeared very melancholy, and even blushed,
whenever fie mentioned my Name.

This Account gave sufficient Matter for my
Thoughts to work upon for several Days. I
interpreted Sjydimiris's Blush a Thou sand different
Ways; I reflected upon all the different
Causes to which it might be owing, and busied
myself with all those innumerable Conjectures,
which, as you know, Madam, such an Incident
always gives Rise to in a Lover's Imagination.
At length I explained it to my own Advantage,
and felt thereby a considerable Increase of my
Affection.

A whole Week having elapsed, without
another Sight of my Confidant, I began to be
greatly alarmed ; when, on the Eighth Day of
this cruel Suspense, I saw him appear ; but with
so many Marks of Disturbance in his Face,
that I trembled to hear what lie had to acquaint
me with.

Oh! Sir, said he, as soon as his Concern
suffered him to speak, Maronite has discovered

your Escape, and the Means by which it was procured:
One of those in whom Urinoe confided,
has betrayed it to him; and the beauteous Syn
is likely to feel the most terrible Effects
of his Displeasure: He has confined her to her
Chamber, and vows to sacrifice her Life to the
Honour of his Family ; which he says, she
has trained ; and he loads that admirable Lady
with so many Reproaches, that it is thought,
her Grief for such undeserved Calumnies will
occasion her Death.

Scarce had he finished there cruel Words,
when I, who all the time he had been fpe:king,-
beheld him with a dying E);, sunk down at
his Feet in a Swoon; which continued so long,
that he began to think me quite dead: However
I at last opened my Eyes; but it was only
to pour forth a River of Tears, and to utter
Complaints, which might have moved the most
obdurate Heart.

After having a long time tormented myself
in weeping and complaining, I at last took a
Resolution, which afforded me rome Alleviation
of my Grief; and the faithful Tsxarcs, seeing
ic'a little composed, left me to myself, with
a Promise to return soon, and acquaint me with
what passed further in the Palace of Marcotmire.

As soon as he was gone, 1 rose from my Bed;
and, dressing myself in those Cloaths I wore
when I was taken Prisoner, I went to the Palace
of Alarcomire; and, demanding to see him,
I was told he was in the Apartment of Sydimni-
is ; and, at my earnest Desire, they conducted
me thither.

When I entered the Room, I beheld that
incomparable Beauty stretched upon a Couch,
dissolved in Tears; and Urinoe upon her Knees,
before her, accompanying with her own, thole
precious Drops which fell from the bright Eyes
of her Mifirefs.

Mlarcomire, who was walking furiously about
the Room, exclaiming with the utmost Violence
against that fair Sufferer, did not observe
my Entrance ; so that I had an Opportunity of
going towards Sydimiris, who, lifting up her
Eyes to look upon me, gave a loud Shriek;
and, by a Look of extreme Anguish, let me
understand, how great her Apprehensions were
upon my Account.

I am come, Madam, said I, to perform
Part of the Promise I made you, and by lying,
to prove your Innocence; and, freeing you from
the Reproaches you sussex on my Account, I
fall have the Happiness to convince you, that
my Life is infinitely less dear to me, than your
Tranquillity. Sydrniris, who hearkened tome
with great Emotion, was going to make
some Answer, when Marcormire, alarmed by
his Sister's Shriek, came towards us, and, viewing
me at first with Astonishment, and then.
with a Smile of Cruelty and Revenge,

Is it possible, said he, that I behold my designed
Murderer again in my Power ?

I am in thy Power, said I, because I am
willing to be so ; and came voluntarily to put
myself into your Hands, to free that excellent
Lady from the Imputation you have laid on her:
Know, MAarcomire, that it is to myself alone
I owed my Liberty, which 1 would fill preserve

against all the Forces thou couldst bring to
deprive me of it ; and this Sword, which left
thee Life enough to threaten mine, would haply
once more put yours in Danger, were I not refrained
by a powerful Consideration, which
Leaves me not the Liberty of even willing you
ill.

Ah ! Dissembler, said Marcomi're, in a Rare,
think not to impose upon me by thy counterfeited
Mildness : Thou art my Prisoner once
more, and I (hall take care to prevent )'oLr
cleaning a Second time.

I am not your Prisoner, replied I, while I
posies iii Sword, which has already defend d
me against greater Numbers than you have hereto
oppose me; but, continued I, throwing down
my Sword at Sydimiris's Feet, I resign my Liberty
to restore that Lady to your good Opinion,
and to free her from those bale Aspersions
thou hast unjustly loaded her with, upon my
Account.

It matters not, said the brutal Brother, taking
up my Sword, whether thou hast resigned, or
I have deprived thee of Liberty; but since thou
art in my Power, thou (hall feel all the Effeas
of my Resentment: Take him away, pursued
he to some of his People; put him into the worst
Dungeon you can find; and let him be guarded
carefully, upon Pain of Death, if he again
escapes.

With there Words, several Men offered to
lead me out of the Room; but I repulsed them
with Disdain; and, making a low Reverence to
Sydimiris, whose Countenance expressed the
Extremes of Fear and Anguish, I followed my

Conductors to the Prison allotted for me; which,
hideous as it was, I contemplated with a secret
Pleasure, since I had by that Action, which
had brought me into it, given a Testimony of
my Love for the adorable Sydimiris.

In which it will be fen, that the Lady is

as generous as her Lover.
Passed some Days in this Confinement, melancholy
enough: My Ignorance of the
Destiny of Sydimiris gave me more Pain than
the Sense of my own Misfortunes ;. and one
Evening, when I was. more then usually disquieted,
one of my Guard entered my Prison,
and, giving me a Letter, retired, without speaking
a Word: I opened this Letter with Precipitation,
and,, by the Light of a Lamp which
was allowed me, I read the following Words.

Sydimiris, To the moi generous Bellmour.
T is not enough to tell you, that the Method
you took to free me from my Brother's Severity,
has filled me with the utmost Esteem
and Admiration. So generous an Alison merits
a greater Acknowlegement, and 1 will make no
Scruple to confers, that my Heart is molt sensibly
touched by it: Yes, Clamour, I have received
this glorious Testimony of your Assertion
with such a Gratitude, as you yourself
could have wished to inspire me with; and it

shall not be long, before you will have a convincing
Proof of the Effect it has had upon the
Spirit of

This Letter, Madam, pursued Sir George,
being wholly calculated to make me hope
that I was not hated by the Divine SydimI'-is;
and that the meditated something in m) Favour
I resigned myself up to the most delightful Expectations.


What! cried I, transported with the excess
of my Joy : Does the most admirable Syn
condescend to assure me, that I have-touched
her Heart ? And does the promise
me, that I fall receive some convincing Proof
of her Acknowlegement ?

Ah ! too happy, and too fortunate Bellmour, to
what a glorious Destiny hast thou been reserved
! And how oughtn't thou to adore these
Fetters, that have procured thee the Esteem
of the Divine Sydimiris !-

Such, Madam, were the Apprehensions,.
which the Billet I had received inspired me
with. I continually flattered myself with the
moll pleasing Hopes ; and during Three Weeks
longer, in which I heard no more from Sydi-
iris, my Imagination, was wholly filled with
those sweet Thoughts, which her Letter had
made me entertain.

At length, on. the Evening of a Day which
I had wholly spent in reading over Sydimiris's
Letter; and interpreting the Sense of it a thousand
different Ways, but all agreeable to my
ardent Wishes; I saw the sage Urinoe enter my

Prisons, accompanied by 'oxares, whom I ha'
not seen during my last Confinement. Wholes
transported at the Sight of these Two Friend;,
and not doubting but they had brought me the
nioft agreeable News, I ran towards them ; and,
throwing myself at Urinoe's Feet, I begged her,
in an Ecstacy of Joy, to acquaint me with Syn
Commands.

Urinoe, in tome Confusion at this Action,
intreated me to rise. 'Tis fit, cried I, in a
Transport I could not matter, that in this
Posture I should receive the Knowlege of that
Felicity Sydimnris has had the Goodness to
promise me. Line sighed at these Words .
and, beholding me with a Look of Compassion
Tenderness,

Would to God, said Ihe, that all I have to
say, were as agreeable, as the first News I have
to tell you; which is, that-you are free, and at
Liberty to leave the Town this Moment ! Syn
continued she, has bought your Freedom,
at the Expence of her own; and, to deliver
you from her Brother's Chains, she has
put on others, haply more cruel than those
you have worn: In fine, (he has married a Man,
whom she detected, to procure your Liberty;
her Brother having granted it to her upon that
Condition alone.

Scarce had Urinoe finished there Words, when
I fell, without Sense or Motion, at her Feet.
Toxartes and she, who had foreseen what might
happen, having provided themselves with Cordials
necessary to restore me, brought me. to:
myself with infinite Trouble.

Cruel! said I to them, with a Tone and
Look, which witnessed the Excess of my
Despair, Why have you hindered me from
dying, at once to prevent the thousand Deaths
I shall sussex from my Grief? Is this the Confirmation
of those glorious Hopes Sydinmiris had
permitted me to entertain ? Is this that Proof
of the Acknowlegements I was to expect ? And
is it by throwing herself into the Arms of my
Rival, that she repays those Obligations she
thinks flie owes me ?

Ah ! inhuman Sydimiris ! was it to make
my Despair more poignant, that thou flattered
me with such a Prope of Happiness ? And
was it necessary, to the Grandeur of thy Nuptials,
that my Life should be the Sacrifice ?

But, how unjust am I, cried I, repenting in
an Instant of those injurious Suspicions; How
unjust am I, to accuse the Divine Sydimiris of
Inhumanity ? Was it not to give me Freedom,
that the bestowed herself upon a Man the
hates ? And has (he not made herself miserable
for ever, to procure me a fansied Happiness ?

Ah ! if it be so, what a Wretch am 1 ? I,
who have been the only Cause of that Misery,
to which she has doomed herself? Ah! Liberty!
pursued I, how I detest thee, since purchased
by the Misfortune of Sydimiris ! And how far
more sweet and glorious were those Chains,
which I wore for her sake !

My Sighs and Tears leaving me no longer
the Power of Speech, I sunk down on my Bed,
oppressed with a mortal Grief.



and said all that sensible and discreet Persons
could think of to alleviate my Despair.

Though I have heard that Sydnilris is married,
replied I, without dying immediately
yet do not imagine, that I will sussex this odious
Life to continue long. If Sorrow do not quickly
dispatch me, I will seek Death by other Means;
for since Sydimiris is lost, I have no more Buff
nets in the World.

The charitable Urine and Toxares endeavoured
in vain to divert me from this sad Resolution,
when Urinoe, finding all their Reasonings
ineffectual, drew a Letter out of her Pocket,
and, presenting it to me, I had Orders, said
the, not to let this Letter be delivered to you,
till you had left the Town ; but the Despair,
to which I see you reduced, does, I conceive,
dispense with my rigorous Observation of those
Directions.

While Urinoe was speaking, I opened this
Letter trembling, and found it as follows.

Containing ain Incident full as probable as

any in Scudery's Romances.
Sydimiris, To Bellmour.
F that Proof of my Gratitude, which I promised
to give you, fall short of your expectations;
blame not the Defer of my Will,
but the Rigour of my Destiny: It was by this

only Way I could give you Liberty y; nor is it
too dearly bought by the Loss of all my happiness,
if you receive it as you ought: Had .1
been allowed to follow my own Inclinations,
there is no Man in the World I would halve
preferred to yourself. I owe this Confession to
the Remembrance of your Affection, of which
you gave me so generous an Instance; and the
Ile 1 expect you will make of it, is, to console
you under a Misfortune, which is common tous
both; though I haply have most Reason to
complain, since I could not be just to you,
without being cruel at the same time, or confer
a Benefit, without loading you with a Misfortune.
If the Sacrifice I have made of myself
for your sake, gives me any Claim to the Continuance
of your Love, I command you, by
the Power it gives me over you, to live, and
not add to the Miseries of my Condition, the
Grief of being the Cause of your Death. Remember,
I will look upon your Disobedience,
as an Act of the most cruel Ingratitude; and
your Compliance with this Request shall ever
be esteemed, as the dearest Mark you can give
of that Passion you have borne to the unfortunate


Ah! Sydimiris, cried I, having read this
Letter, more cruel in your Kindness than Severity
! After having deprived me of yourself,
do you forbid me to die; and expose me by so
rigorous a Command to Ills infinitely more
:hard and painful than Death ?

diminish, thou shalt be obeyed ; we will not dye,
since thou hast commanded us to live ; and,
notwithstanding the Tortures to which thou
condemned us, we will obey this Command
and give thee a glorious Proof of our present
Submission, by enduring that Life, which the
Loss of thee has rendered truly wretched.

Urine and Toxares, somewhat reassured, by
the resolution I had taken, exhorted me by all
the Persuasions, Friendihip could put in their
Mouths, to persevere in it i and, Urinoe bidding
me Farewel, I endeavoured to prevail upon
her to procure me a Sight of Sydim'iris once
more, or at least to bear a Letter from me to
her ; but (he refused both there Requests so
obstinately, telling me, Sydiimiris would neither
con went to the one nor the other, that I was obliged
to be contented with the Promise she made
me, to represent my Affliction in a true Light
to her Mistress ; and to assure her, that nothing
but her absolute Commands could have hindered
me from dying. Then, taking leave of
me with much Tenderness, she went out of
the Prison, leaving Toxares with me, who assisted
me to dress, and conduced me out of
that miserable Place, where I had passed so many
sad, and also joyful Hours. At a Gate to which
he brought me, I found a Horse waiting; and,
having embraced this faithful Confidant, with
many Expressions of Gratitude, I bellowed a
Ring of some Value upon him to remember me
by; and, mounting my Horse, with a breaking
Heart, I took the first Road which presented
itself to my Eyes, and galloped away, without
knowing whither I went. I rode the whole

Night, so totally engrossed by my Despair, that
I did not perceive my Horse was so tired, it
could hardly carry me a Step farther: At last
the poor Beast fell down under me, so that I
was obliged to dismount; and, looking about
me, perceived I was in a Forest, without seeing
the least Appearance of any Habitation.

The Wilderness, and Solitude of the Place,
flattered my Despair, and while my Horse was
feeding upon what Grass he could find, I wandered
about: The Morning just breaking, gave
me Light enough to direct my Steps. Chance
at last conducted me to a Cave, which seemed
to have been the Residence of some Hermit, or
unfortunate Lover like myself. It was dug at
the Side of a Rock, the Entrance to it thickset
with Bunlcs, which hid it from View. 1
descended by a few Steps cut rudely enough,
and was convinced, it had formerly served fora
Habitation for tome religious or melancholy
Person; for there were Seats of Turf
raised on each Side of it, a kind of Bed composed
of dried Leaves and Ruffles, and a Hole
made artificially at the Top, to admit the Light.

While I considered this Place attentively,
I all at once took up a Resolution, inspired by
my Despair; which was, to continue there,
and indulge my Melancholy in a Retirement
so fitted for my Purpose.

Giving my Horse therefore Liberty to go
where he pleated, and hanging up my Arms
upon a Tree near my Cave, I took Possession
of this solitary Mansion, with a gloomy Kind
of Satisfaction, and devoted all my Hours to
the Contemplation of my Misfortunes.

VOL. II. F I lived

I lived in this manner, Madam, for Ten
Months, without feeling the least Desire to
change imy Habitation ; id, during all that
time, no Mortal approached my Solitude, 1o
that I lived pcrfcily cure and undiscovered.

Sir George pausing here to take Breath, the
old Baronet laid what will be found in the
following Chapter.

A single Combat fought with prodigious

Valour, and described with amazing
Accuracy.
G I V E me Leave, Sir, said Sir Charles, to

ask, If you eat in all this Time e
Alas! Sir, replied Sir George, Sighs and Tears
were all my Sustenance.

Sir Charter, Mr. Glanville, and Miss, laughing
at this Answer, Arabella seemed greatly confused:


It is not to be imagined, said she, that Sir
George; or, to say better, Prince f/iruidmore, lived
'sen Months without eating any thing to support
Nature; but such trifling Circumstances are
always left out, in the Relations of Histories;
and truly an Audience muss be very dull and
unapprehensive, that cannot conceive, without
being told, that a Man must necessarily eat in
the Space of Ten Months.

But the Food Sir George lived on, replied
the Baronet, was very unsubstantial, and would
otl afford him much Nourishment.

I suppose, resumed Arabella, he lived upon
filch Provisions as theorist afforded him; such a.
wild Fruits, Herbs, bitter Sallads, and the
like ; which, considering the iM/elanclholy that
possessed him, would appear a voluptuous Repast
; and which the unfortunate Orontes,
when he was in the same Situation, thought
infinitely too good for him.

Sir Charles, finding Arabella took no Notice
of the Historian's Hyperbole of living upon his
Sighs and Tears, passed it over, for fear of offending
her; and Sir George, who had been in
some Anxiety how to bring himself off, when
he perceived Arabella was reasonable enough
to suppose must have eat during his Abode
in the Forest, went on with his Relation in
this Manner.

I lived, as I before observed to you, Malam,
in this Cave for Ten Months i and truly
1 was to reconciled to that solitary way of Life,
and found so much Sweetness in it, that I believe,
I should have remained there till this
Day, but for the Adventure which I am going
to recount.

It being my Custom to walk out every Evening
in the Forest; returning to my Cave,
something later then usual, 'heard the Cries
of a Woman at some Distance, who seemed to
be in Distress: I flopped to listen from what
Side those Cries proceeded; and, perceiving
they seemed to approach nearer to me, I took
down my Armour-from the Tree where I had
hung it; and hastily arming myself, shaped my
Course towards the Place from whence thole

F 2 Complaints

Complaints seemed to come, resolving to assisi
that unknown Person with all the Strength
that was left me.

Having gone some Paces, I spied through
the Branches of the Trees a Man on Horseback
with a Lady, who struggled to get loose,
and at times calling aloud for Succour.

This Sight inflaming me with Rage against
that impious Ravisher; I flew towards him;
And when I came within hearing;

Hold, Wretch! cried I, and cease to offer
Violence to that Lady, whom thou bereft
away by Force; or prepare to defend thyself
against one, who will die, before he will sussex
thee to prosecute thy unjust Designs.

The Man, without answering me, clapped
Spurs to his Horse ; and it would have been
impossible to have overtaken him, had not my
own Horse, which had never quitted the Forest,
appeared in my View: 1 quickly mounted him,
and followed the Track the Ravisher had taken,
with fitch Speed, that I came up with himin a
Moment.

Caitiff! said I, release the Lady, and defend
thyself. These Words, which I accompanied
with a thundering Blow upon his
Head-piece, obliged him to set down the Lady,
who implored Heaven, with the utmost Ardour,
to grant me the Victory: And, recoiling
back a few Paces, to take a View of me,

I know not, said he, for what Reason thou
fittest thyself to oppose my Designs; but I
well know, that thou shalt dearly repent of thy
Temerity.

me, and aimed so heavy a Blow at my Head,
that, had I not received it. on my Shield, I
might haply have no longer been ili a Condition
to defend the distressed Lady : But, having,
with the greatest Dexterity imaginable,
avoided this Blow, I made at him wil so
much Fierceness, and directed my Aims so
well, that in a few Moments I wounded him
in several Places; and his Arms were all dyed
with his Blood.
This good Success redoubled my Vigour;
and having, by a lucky Stroke with my Sword,
cut the Strings of his Head-piece, it fell off:
And his Head being bare, I was going to let
fall a dreadful Blow upon it, which doubtless
have shivered it in a thousand Pieces,
when he cried out for Quarter, and, letting fall
his Sword, by that Acton assured me my victory
was intire.

Live Wretch, cried I, since thou art bale
enough to value Life after being vanquished;
but swear upon my Sword, that thou wilt never
more attempt the Liberty of that Lady.

While I was speaking, 1 perceived he was
no longer able to sit his Horse: But, staggering
a Moment, he fell off, and lay extended without
Motion upon the Ground. Touched with
Compassion at this Sight, I alighted, and, supposing
him to be in a Swoon, was preparing to
give him some Assistance; but, upon my nearer
Approach, I found he was quite dead.

Leaving therefore this mournful Objet, I
I turned about, with an Intention to go and
offer the diPtrefic( Lady my further Help ; but
I perceived her already at my Feet.

F 3 Valiant

Valiant Knight, said she, with a Tone of
Voice so bewitching, that all my Faculties
were suspended, as by Inchantment, sussex
me, on my Knees, to thank you, for the Deliverance
you have procured me'from that base
Man; since to your admirable Valour I owe
not only the Preservation of my Life; but,
what is infinitely dearer to me, my Honour.

The Astonishment, wherewith I beheld the
miraculous Beauty that appeared before me,
kept me a Moment in such an attentive Gaze,
that 1 forgot she was at my Feet: Recollecting
mnyflf, however, with some Confusion at my
Neele'1,

Oh! rise, Madam, cried I, helping her hup
with infinite Respect, and debase not such leers
to a Poflure, in which all the Monarchs
on the Earth might glory to appear before
it.

That you may the better conceive the Alteration
which the Sight of this fairUnknown
produced in my Soul, I will endeavour, to
give you a Description of her Beauty, which
was altogether miraculous.

C H A P. IX.
Ii which the Reader will find a Description

of a Beauty, in a Style truly sublime,
TH E new-fallen Snow, pursued Sir Gcsrge,

was tanned, in Comparison of the refined
Purity of that White which made up the

Ground of her Complexion ; and, though Fear
had a little gathered the Carnations of her
Cheeks, yet her Joy at being delivered
seemed to plant them there with such fresh
Advantages, that my Eye might shrink at the
Brightness of that mingled Lustre : Her Mouth,
as well for Shape as Colour, might shame the
Imitation of the best Pencils, and the liveliest
Tints; and though through same petty Intervals
of Joy, it wanted the Smiles, which Grief
and Terror sequestered, yet she never opened it,
hut like the East, at the Birth of a beautiful
Day, and then discovered Treasures, whole excelling
Whiteness made the Price inestimable:
All the Features of her Face had so near a
Kindred to Proportion and Symmetry, as the
several Matters of apelles's Art might have
called it his Glory to have copied Beautiesfrom
her, as the best of Models: The Circumference
of her Visage shewed the Extremes of
an imperfect Circle, and almost formed it to a
perse Oval: And this Abridgment of Marvels
was tapered by a Pair of the brightest
Stars, that ever were lighted up by the Hand
of Nature: As their Colour was the same with
the Heavens, there was a spherical Harmony
in their Motion ; and that mingled with a Vivacity
so penetrating, as neither the firmness
Eye, nor the firougeit Soul, could arm themselves
with a Resistance of Proof against thorn
pointed Glories: Her Head was crowned with
a prodigious Quantity of fair long Hair, which
Colour as fitly suited the Beauty of her Eyes,
as Imagination could make it: To there Marvels
of Face were joined the rest of her Neck,

F 4 Hands,

Hands, and Shape ; and there denied a Conti
between the Fornl and WiVitence l of the two
former, which h:,l the largely Commission from
Nature to work Wonders.

In fine, her Beauty was miraculous, and
could not fail of producing a sudden Effrca
upon a Heart like mine.

Having passed in an Infant from the extremest
Admiration, to forgetting yet more
tender, I reiterated my Offers of Service to
the fair Unknown ; who told me, she feared her
Father had Occasion for rome Assistance, her
Ravisher having left his Men to engage him, and
keep off his Pursuit, while he rode off with
his Prize: Hereupon I begg'd her: to direti me
to the Place where fne left her Father, assuring
her I would gladly venture my Life a Second
time, to preserve his; and she desiring to go
with me, I placed her before me on my Horse,
and had the exquisite Pleasure of supporting
with my Arms the fairest and most admirable
Creature in the World.

In Ifs than half an Hour, which had appeared
to me but a Moment, we got to the
Place where the had been torn from her Father;
whom we beheld with three of his Servants,
maintaining a Fight against twice as many of
their Enemies.

Having gently ret down the beauteous Unknown
upon the Grass, I flew to the Relief
of her Father; and, throwing myself furiously
anongaR his Assailants, dispatched two of them
*with so many Blows: The others, seeing so unexpected
an Assistance, gave back a little; and

I took Advantage of their Consternation, to
redouble my Blows, and brought Two more
of-them at my Feet.

There remained now but Four to overcome;
and my Arrival having given new Vigour to
those whose Part I had taken, they seconded
me so well, that we toon had nothing more left
to do; for the rest, seeing their Comrades slain,
sought their Safety in Flight: We were too
generous to pursue them, the Blood of such
Wretches being unworthy to be shed by our
Swords.

The fair Unknown, seeing us Conquerors,
few to embrace her Father; who, holding her
pressed between his Arms, turned his Eyes upon
me ; then quitting her, came towards mi, and,
in the most obliging Terms imaginable, returned
me Thanks for the Assistance I had
brought him; and being informed by his
Daughter, of what I had done for her preservation,
this old Gentleman renewed his Acknowlegements,
calling me the Preserver of
his Life, the valiant Defender of his Daughter's
Honour, his tutelary Angel, and the
Guardian of his House.

In fine, he loaded me with so many Thanks
and Praises, that I could not choose but be in
some Confusion; and, to put an End to them, i
begged he would inform me, by what means
he came into that Misfortune.

He told me, that, residing in a Castle at the
Extremity of this Forest, the Charms of hi
Daughter had captivated a neighbouring Lord,
whose Character and Person being disagreeable

F 5 b,;th

both to her and himself, he had absolutely refused
to give her to him : Thereupon he had let
upon them as they were going to visit a Relation
at tome Distance, and, dragging Pbilsnice
out of the Coach, put her before him on his
Horse, and carried her away, leaving Eight of
his Men to engage him, and his Servants; who,
being but Four in Number, must inevitably
have perished, had I not come to his Relief,
and, by my miraculous Valour, vanquished all
his Enemies.

Saying this, he desired me to go home with
him to the Castle; and having led his Daughter
to the Coach, infilled upon my placing myself
next her; and, getting in himself, ordered
them to return home.

This Accident having altered his Design of
making the Visit which had been the Occasion
of his Journey;

The Baron, for that I found was his Title,
entertained me, all the Way, with repeated Expressions
of Acknowlegements and Tenderness;
and the incomparable Philonice condescended
also to assure me of her Gratitude for the Service
I had done her.

At our Arrival at the Castle, I perceived it
was very large and magnificent: The Baron conduced
me to one of the belt Apartments, and
would slay in the Room till my Armour was
taken off, that he might be assured I had received
no Hurts: Having rendered him the like
Civility in his own Chamber, and satisfied
myself he was not wounded, we returned to
the beautiful Phil'nicej and this second Sight

having finished my Defeat, I remained so absolutely
her Slave, that neither Dorothea nor
Syrdimiriis were mole passionately beloved.

At the earned Intreaty of the Baron, I said
some Weeks in the Cate ; during which, the
daily Sight of Plilonicc so augmented my
Flames, that I was no longer ina Condition to
conceal them; but, fearing to dispense that Divine
Beauty by a Confession of my Passion, I
languished in secret ; and the Constraint I laid
upon myself, gave me such Torments, that r
fell into a profound Melancholy, and looked
so pale and d4eEed, that the Baron was sensible
of the Alteration, and conjured me in the
most pressing Terms, to acquaint him with the
Cause of my Uneasiness: But though I continued
obstinately silent with my Tongue, yet
my Eyes spoke intelligibly enough; and the
Blushes which appeared in the fair Check
of Philonicc, whenever she spoke to me on the
Subjea of my Grief, convinced me (he was
not ignorant of my Passion.

At length the Agitation of my Mind throwing
me into a Fever, the Baron, who was firmly
persuaded, that my Illness proceeded from some
Concealed Vexation, pressed me continually to
declare myself; and, finding all his Entreaties
ineffectual, he commanded his Daughter to endeavour
to find out the Cause of that Grief
which had put me into such a Condition.

For that Purpose therefore, having brought
the fair Philonice into my Chamber, he staid a
few Minutes, and, leaving the Room, under
Pretence of Business, Pbilonice remained alone

F 6 by

by my Bedside, her Women, out of Respect,
slaying at the other End of the Chamber.

This Divine Person, seeing herself alone with
me, and remembring her Father's Command,
blushed, and call down her Eyes in such apparent
Confusion, that I could not help observing
it: And, interpreting it to the Displeasure she
took in being so near me,

Whatever Joy I take in the Honour your
'fit does me, Madam, said I, in a weak Voice;
y ct since nothing is so dear to me, as your satisfaction,
I would rather dispense with this
Mark of your Goodness to an unfortunate
Wretch, then see you in the least Constraint.

And why, replied the, with a Tone full of
Sweetness, do you suppose that I am here by
Confiraint, when it would be more just to believe,
that in visiting the valiant Defender of
my Honour, and the Life of my Father, I only
follow my own Inclinations ?

Ah ! Madam, said I, transported with Joy
at so favourable a Speech, the little Service I
had the Happiness to do you, does not merit
lb infinite a Favour; and tho' I had lost the best
Part of my Blood in your Defence, I should
have been well rewarded with your Safety.

Since you do not repent of what you have
done, replied the, I am willing to be obliged
to you for another Favour; and ask it with the
greater Hope of obtaining it, as I nut acquaint
voit, it is by my Father's Command I take
that Liberty, who is much interested in my
Success.

There is no Occasion, Madam, returned I,
to make use of any Interest but your own, to
engage me to obey you, since that is, and ever
will be, all-powerful with me : Speak then,
Madam, and let me know what it is you desire
of me, that I may, once in my Life, have the
Glory of obeying you.

It is, said the, blushing frill more than before,
that you will acquaint us with the Cause of that
Melancholy, which has, as we imagine, occasioned
your present Illness.

At there Words I trembled, turned pale ;and,
not daring to discover the true Cause of my
Affliction, I remained in a profound Silence.

I see, said the beautiful Philonuce, that you
have no Inclination to obey me; and since my
Request has, as I perceive, given you some
Disturbance, I will prevail upon my Father to
press you no farther upon this Subject.

No, Madam, said I, eagerly ; the Baron shall
be satisfied, and you shall be obeyed ; though,
after the Knowlege of my Crime, you doom
me to that Death I so justly merit.

Yes Madam, this unfortunate Man, who has
had the Glory to acquire your Esteem by the
little Service he did you, has cancelled the Merit
of that Service by daring to adore you.

I love you, divine Philonice; and, not being
able either to repent, or cease to be guilty of
loving you, I am resolved to die, and spare
you the Trouble of pronouncing my Sentence.
I beseech you therefore to believe, that I would
have died in Silence, but for your Command
to declare myself, and you Should never have

known the Excess of my Love and Despair,
had not my Obedience to your Will obliged
me to confers it.

I finished there Words with so much Fear
and Confusion, that I durst not lift my Eyes
up to the fair Face of Philonice, to observe how
she received this Discourse I waited therefore,
trembling, for her Answer; but finding that in
several Minutes the spoke not a Word, I ventured
at lait, to cast a languishing Glance upon
the Visage I adored, and saw so many Marks
of Disorder upon it, that I was almost dead
with the Apprehensions of having offended her
beyond even the Hope of procuring her Pardons
by my Death.

wherein Sir George concludes his History;
which produces an unexpected Effet.

H E Silence of Philonice, continued Sir
George, pierced me to the Heart; and
when I saw her rise from her Seat, and prepare
to go away without speaking, Grief took such
Postilion of my Spirits, that, uttering a Cry, I
fell into a Swoon, which, as I afterwards was
informed, greatly alarmed the beautiful Philo-nice;
who, resuming her Seat, had the Goodness
to assist her Women in bringing me to
myself; and, when I opened my Eyes, 1 had

the Satisfaction to behold her still by me, and
all the Signs of Compassion in her Face.

This Sight a little re-alluring me; I alk your
Pardon, Madam, said I, for the Condition in
which I have appeared before you, and also for
that I am not yet dead, as is doubtless your
Wish: But I will make Haste, pursued I,
sighing, to fulfil your Desires ; and you shall
soon be freed from the Sight of a miserable
Wretch, who, to his last Moment, will not
cease to adore you.

It is not your Death that I desire, said the
fair Philonice ; and, after having preserved both
my Father and me from Death, it is not reasonable,
that we should suffer you to die, if we
can help it.

Live therefore, Bellmotur, pursued she, blushing
; and live, impossible, without continuing in
that Weakness I cannot choose but condemn:
Yet whatever are your Thoughts for the future,
Yemen-ber that your Death will be a Fault I
cannot resolve to pardon.

Speaking these Words, without giving me
time to answer, she left my Chamber ; and I
found something so sweet and favourable in
them, that I resolved to obey her, and forward
my Cure as much as I was able: However, the
Agitation of Spirits increased my Fever so
much, that my Life was despaired of.

The Baron hardly ever left my Bedside.
Philonice came every Day to see me, and seemed
extremely moved at the Danger I was in. One
Day, when I was worse than usual, she came

close to the Bedside; and, opening the curtain,


What Bellmhstr, said The, do you pay so
little Obedience to my Commands, that you
resolve to die ?

Heaven is my Witness, Madam, said I,
faintly, that nothing is so dear and sacred tome
as your Commands; and since, out of your
superlative Goodness, you are pleased to have
some Care for my Life, I would preserve it to
obey you, were it in my Power ; but, alas !
Madam, I strive in vain to repel the Violence
of my Distemper.

In a few Days more, 1 was reduced to the
]aft Extremity: It was then that the fair
discovered, that he did not hate me; for
she made no Scruple to weep before me; and
those Tears she so liberally fed, had so powerful
an Effect upon my Mind, that the Contentment
I felt, communicated itself to my
Body, and gave such a Turn to my Distemper,
that my Recovery was not only hoped, but expected.


The Baron expressed his Satisfaction at this
Alteration, by the most affectionate Expressions;
and though the fair Philonice said very
little, yet I perceived by the Joy that appeared
in her fair Eyes, that she was not lets interested
in my Recovery, than her Father.

The Physicians having declared me out of
Danger, the Baron, who had taken his Resolutions
long before, came one Day into my
Chamber; and ordering those who attended me,
to leave us alone,

Prince, laid he, for in recounting my History
to him, I had disclosed my true Quality, I am
not ignorant of that Affection you bear my
Daughter; and am sensible it has occasioned
the Extremity to which we have seen you reduced:
Had you been pleased to acquaint me
with your Sentiments, you would have avoided
those Displeasures you have suffered ; for though
your Birth were not so illustrious as it is, yet,
preferring Virtue to all other Advantages, I
should have esteemed my Daughter honoured
by your Love, and have freely bestowed
her on you: But since to those rare Qualities
wherewith Heaven has so liberally endowed
you, you add also that of a Birth so noble,
doubt not but I shall think myself highly favoured
by your Alliance: If therefore your
Thoughts of my Daughter be not changed,
and you esteem her worthy to be your Bride, I
here solemnly promise you to bellow her upon
you, as soon as you are perfectly recovered.

I leave you to guess, Madam, the Joy which
I felt at this Discourse: It was so great, that
it would not permit me to thank him, as I
should have done, for the inestimable Blessing
he bestowed on me.

I fawPbilonice a few Minutes after; and, being
commanded by her Father to give me her Hand,
file did so, without any Marks of Reluctance,
and, having respectfully kissed it, I vowed to be
her Slave for ever.

Who would have imagined, continued Sir
George, with a profound Sigh, that Fortune,
while she thus seemed to flatter me, was preparing
to make me sussex the severest Torments

? I began now to leave my Bed, and was
able to walk about my Chamber. The Baron
was making great Preparations for our Nuptials;
when one Night I was alarmed with the Cries
of Phinlccc's Women; and, a few Moments
after, the Baron came into my Chamber, with
a distracted Air,

O ! Son, cried he, for so he always called
me, now Philonice is lost both to you and me:
She is carried off by Force, and I am preparing
to follow and rescue her, if possible; but I fear
my Endeavours will be fruitless, since I know
not which Way her Ravishers have taken.

Oh ! Sir, cried I, transported both with Grief
and Rage, you shall not go alone: Her Rescue
belongs to me , and I will eft'a it, or perish in
the Attempt.

The Baron, having earnestly conjured me
not to expose myself to the Danger of a relapse,
by fo.imprudent a Resolution, was obliged
to quite, Word being brought him, that
his Horse was ready: And as soon as he was
gone out of the Room, in spite of all that could
be said to prevent me, by my Attendants, I
made them put on my Armour.; and, mounting
a Horse I had caused to be made ready, sallied
furiously out of the Cafle, breathing out Vows
of Vengeance against the Wretch who had
robbed me of Philonice.

I rode the whole Night without slopping.
Day appeared, when I found 'myself near a
finally Village. I entered it, and made stria
Enquiry after the .Ravisher of Philon.ce, describing
the fair creature, and offering vast Rewards
to any who could bring me the least Intelligence

of her: But all was in vain; I could
make no Discovery.

After travelling several Days, to no Purpose,
I returned to the Cafile, in order to know if
the Baron had been more successful in his Pursuit
then myself; but I found him oppressed
with Grief: He had heard no Tidings of his
Daughter, and had suffered no final Apprehensions
upon my. Account. Having assured
him I found myself very able to travel, I took
an affectionate Leave of him, promising him
never to give over my Search, till 1 had found
the Divine Philonicc: But Heaven has not permitted
me that Happiness; and though I have
spent several Years in searching for her, 1 have
never been able to discover where fate is : Time
has not cured me of my Grief for her Loss;
and, though by an Effect of my Destiny,
another Object possesses my Soul, yet I do
not cease to deplore her Misfortune, and to offer
up Vows forever Happiness.

And is this all you have to say ? laid Arabella,
whom the latter Part of his History had
extremely surprised; or are we to expect a
Continuance of your Adventures ?

Shave faithfully related all my Adventures,
that are worthy your Hearing, Madam, returned
Sir George; and I shatter myself, you
will do me the Justice to own, that I have
been rather unfortunate than faithless and that
Mr. Glanville had littleReafon to tax me with
Inconstancy.

In my Opinion, refunded Arabella, Mr.
Glanville spoke too favourably of you, when he
called you only inconstant . and if he had added

the Epithet of Ungrateful and Unjust, he
would have marked your Character better.

For, in fine, Fir, purified she, you will never
persuade any reasonable Person, that your
being aMe to lose the Remembrance of the fair
and generous Sydimiris, in your new Passion for
Philonice, was not an Excess of Levity: But
your suffering so tamely the Loss of this last
Beauty, and allowing her to remain in the
Hands of her Ravisher, while you permit another
Affection to take Possession of your Soul,
is such an Outrage to all Truth and Constancy,
that you deserve to be ranked among the falsest
of Mankind.

Alas ! Madam, replied Sir George, who had
not foreseen the Iftfuence Arabella would draw
from this last Adventure, What would you
have an unfortunate Man, whose Hopes have
been so often, and so cruelly, disappointed, do?
I have bewailed the Loss of Philonice, with a
Deluge of Tears; I have taken infinite Pains to
find her, but to no Purpose; and when Heaven
compassionate my Sufferings, presented
to my Eyes, an Objet, to whom the whole
World ought to pay Adoration, how could I
resins that powerful Impulse, which forced me to
love what appeared so worthy of my Affection ?

Call nor, interrupted 'Arabella, that an irresistible
Impulse, which was only the Effect
of thy own changing Humour: The same excuse
might be pleaded for all the Faults we see
committed in the World ; and Men would no
longer be answerable for their own Crimes.
Had you imitated the illustrious Heroes of Antiquity,
as well in the Constancy of their assertions,

as, it must be confessed, you have done
in their admirable Valour; you would now be
either sighing in your Cave for the Loss of the
generous Sydimiris, or wandering through the
World in Search of the beautiful Philonice.
Had you persevered in your Affection, and continued
your Pursuit of that Fair-one; you
would, perhaps, ere this, have found her sleeping
under the Shade of a Tree in some lone So-reft,
as Philodafpes did his admirable Delia, or
disguised in a Slave's Habit, as ,lriobarfaanes saw
his Divine Olympia; or bound haply in a Chariot,
and have had the Glory of freeing her, as
Amlbrismer did the beauteous Agone; or in a
Flip in the Hands of Pirates, like the incomparable
Eliza; or-enough,

dear Niece, interrupted Sir Charles;
you have quoted Examples sufficient, if this inconstant
Man would have the Grace to follow
them.

True, Sir, replied Arabella; and I would
recommend to his Consideration the Conduct
of those illustrious Persons I have named, to the
end that, pursuing their Steps, he may arrive
at their Glory and Happiness, that is the Reputation
of being perfectly constant, and the Possession
of his Mistress: And be allured, Sir, pursued
Arabella, looking at Sir George, that Heaven
will never restore you the Crown of your
Ancestors, and place you upon the Throne to
which you pretend, while you make yourself
unworthy of its Protection, by so shameful an
Inconstancy.

1 perhaps speak with too much Freedom to a
great Prince; whom though Fortune has despoiled

of his Dominions, is intitled to a certain
Degree of Reftpet: But I conceive, it belongs
to me, in a particular manner, to resent the
Baseness of that Crime, to which you are pleased
to make me theExcufe; and, looking upon
myself, as dishonoured by those often prostituted
Vows you have offered me, 1 am to tell you,
that I am highly disobliged; and forbid you to
appear in my Presence again, till you have relumed
those Thoughts, which are worthy your
noble Extraction ; and are capable of treating
me with that Refpet, that is my Due.

Saying this, she rose from he Seat, and walked
very majestically out of the Room, leaving
Sir George overwhelmed with Shame and Vexation
at having conduced the latter Part of his
Narration so island drawn upon himself a
Sentence, which deprived him of all his Hopes.

C H A P. XI.
Containing only a few Inferences, drawn

from the foregoing Chapters.
aM R. Glanville, exceffivelydelighted with

this Event, could not help laughing at
the unfortunate Baronet; who seemed, by his
Silence, and down-cast Looks, to expect it.

Who would have imagined, said he, that so
renowned a Hero would have tarnished the
Glory of his Laurels, as my Cousin says, by so
base an Ingratitude ? Indeed, Prince, pursued
he, laughing, you must resolve to recover your

Reputation, either by retiring again to your
Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, for the
generous Sydimiris; or elle wander through the
World, in search of the Divine Philonice.

Don't triumph, dear Charles, replied Sir
George, laughing in his Turn; have a little
Compassion upon me, and confers, that nothing
could be more unfortunate, than that
damn'd Slip I made at the latter End of my
History: But for that, my Reputation for
Courage and Constancy had been as high as
the great Oroondates, or 'cuba.

Since you have lo fertile an Invention, said
Sir Charles, you may easily repair this Mistake.
Ods-heart ! It is pity you are not poor enough
to be an Author; you would occupy a Garret
in Grub-street, with great Fame to yourself,
and Diversion to the Public.

Oh ! Sir, cried Sir George, I have Stock
enough by me, to set up for an Author Tomorrow,
if I please: I have no less than Five
Tragedies, some quite, others almost finished;
Three or Four Essays on Virtue, Happiness, &c.
Three thousand Lines of an Epic Poem; half a
Dozen Epitaphs; a few Acrostics; and a long
String of Puns, that would serve to embellish a
Daily Paper, if I was disposed to write one.

Nay, then, interrupted Mr. Glanville, you
are qualified for a Critic at the Bedford Coffeehouse;
where, with the rest of your Brothers,
Demy-wits, you may sit in Judgment upon the
Productions of a Young, a R- , or a Jonson.
Rail with premeditated Malice at the
Rambler ; and, for the want of Faults, turn
even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule: The

Language, because it reaches to Perfection,
may be called stiff, laboured, and pedantic; the
Criticisms, when they let in more Light than
your weak Judgment can bear, superficial and
ostentatious Glitter; and because those Papers
contain the finest System of Ethics yet extant,
damn the queer Fellow, for over-propping Virtue;
an excellent newPhrafe ! which those who
can find no Meaning in, may accommodate
with one of their own ; then give shrewd Hints,
that some Persons, though they do not publish
their Performances, may have more Merit,
than those that do.

Upon my Soul, Charles, said Sir George,
thou art such an ill-natured Fellow, that I am
afraid, thou wilt be sneering at me when I am
gone; and wilt endeavour, to persuade Lady
Bella, that not a Syllable of my Story is true.
Speak, pursued he, Wilt thou have the Cruelty
to deprive me of my lawful Claim to the great
Kingdom of Kent; and rob me of the Glory
of fighting singly against Five hundred Men ?

I do not know, said Sir Charles, whether
my Niece be really imposed upon, by the Gravity
with which you told your surprising history;
but I protest, I thought you were in earns
at first; and that you meant to make us
believe it all to be Sad.

You are so fitly punished, said Mr. Glanville,
for that ill-judged Adventure you related
last, by the bad Opinion Lady Bella entertains
of you, that I need not add to your Misfortune:
And therefore, you shall be Prince J/eridomery if
you please since, under that Character, you

are obliged not to pretend to any La!sd, bus;
the incomparable Phi/llnice.

Sir George, who understood his Meaning,
went home, to think of some Means, by which
he might draw himself out of the Embarrassment
he was in; and Mr. Glanville, as he had
promised, did not endeavour to undeceive Lady
Bella, with regard to the History he had feigned;
being very well satisfied with his having
put it out of his Power to make his Addresses
to her, since she now looked upon him as the
Lover of Philsnice.

As for Sir Charles, he did not penetrate int.
the Meaning of Sir Gorse's Story ; and only
imagined, that by relating such a Heap of Adventures,
he had a Deciin to entertain the
Company, and ,ive a Proof of the Felicity of
his Invention; and liss Glanavi!, who supposed,
he had been ridiculing her Cousin's
strange Notions, was better pealed with him
than ever.

Arabella, however, was left satisfied than
any of them: She could not endure to see so
brave a Knight, who drew his Birth from a
Race of Kings, tarnish the Glory of his gallant
Actions by so bare a Perfidy.

Alas! said the to herself, How much Reason
has the beautiful Phbilcnice to accuse me for
all the Anguish she suffers ? since I am the
Cause, that the ungrateful Prince, on whom
the bestows her Affections, suffers her to remain
quietly, in the Hands of her Ravisher,
without endeavouring to rescue her: But, 01h!
too lovely, and unfortunate Fair-one, said she,
as if she had been present, and listening to her,

VOL. II. G d(itilnguiih,

distinguish, I beseech you, between those Faults,
which theW island those which Necessity, makes
us commit. I am the Cause, 'tis true, of thy
Lover's Infidelity; but I am the innocent
Cause; and would repair the Evils, my fatal
Beauty gives Rise to, by any Sacrifice in my
Power to make.

While Arabella, by her romantic Generosity,
bewails the imaginary Afflictions of the
full as imaginary Philonice; Mr. Glanville, who
thought the Solitude she lived in, confirmed
her in her absurd and ridiculous Notions, desired
his Father to press her to go to London.

Sir Charls complied with his Request, and
earnestly intreated her to leave the Castle, and
spend a few Months in Town. Her Year of
Mourning being now expired, she consented to
go; but Sir Charles, who did not think his
Son's Health absolutely confirmed, proposed to
send a few Weeks at Bath; which was readily
complied with by arabella.

For the Shortness of which the Length

I R Gcotge, to gratify Arabella's
Humour, had not presumed to
S come to the Castle for several

Days; but, hearing that they were
preparing to leave the Country,
he wrote a short Billet to her; and in the Style
of Romance, most humbly intreated her to
grant him a Moment's Audience.

Arabella being informed byLucy, to whom Sir
George's Gentleman had addressed himself, that
he had brought a Letter from his Malter, the

G 2 oriJee4

ordered her to bring him to her Apartment, and
as soon as he appeared,

How comes it; said she, that the Prince your
Master, has had. the Presumption to importune
me again, after my absolute Commands to
the contrary ?

The Prince, my Masser, Madam, said the
Man, excessively surprised.

Ay ! said Arabella, Are you not Sir George's
'Squire? And does he not trust you with his
rnoP secret Thoughts ?

I belong to Sir George Bellmour, Madam,
replied the Man, who did not underhand what
She meant: I have not the Honour to be a
'Squire.

No! interrupted Arabella; 'tis strange then,
that he should have honoured you with his Commission;
Pray, what is it you come to request
for him ?

My Master, Madam, said he, ordered me
to get this Letter delivered to your Ladyship,
and to slay for your Commands.

You would persuade me, said she, sternly,
being provoked that he did not deliver the
Letter upon his Knees, as was the Custom in
Romances, that you are not acquainted' with
the Purport of this audacious Billet, since you
express so little Fear of my Displeasure ;' 'but
know, presumptuous, that I am mortally
offended with your Malter, for his daring to
suppose I would read this 'Proof-at once of
his Insolence and Infidelity; and was you worth
my Resentment, I would haply make you sussex
for your Want of Respect to me.

her Anger, and puzzled extremely ; countermand
what she meant, was opening his Mouth
to say something, 'tis probable in his own Defence,
when Arabella, preventing him,

I know what thou wouldst say, laid she:
Thou wouldst abuse my Patience by a false
Detail of thy Mailer's Sighs, Tears, Exclamations,
and Despair.

Indeed, Madam, I don't intend to say any
such Thing, replied the Man.

No ! repeated Arabella, a little disappointed,
Bear back his presumptuous Billet,
which, I suppose, contains the melancholy Account;
and tell him, He that could so soon
forget the generous S)dlmiris for Philonice, and
could afterwards be false to that incomparable
Beauty, is not person worthy to adore Arabhein.

The Man, who could not tell what to make
of this Message, and feared he should forget
there two hard Names, humbly intreated her
to be pleased to acquaint his Malter, by a Line,
with her Intentions. Arabella, supposing he
meant to importune her till more, made a
Sign with her Hand, very majestically, for
him to be gone; but he, not able to comprehend
her Meaning, flood till, with an Air of
Perplexity, not daring to beg her to explain
herself; supposing, she, by that Sign, required
something of him.

Why dost thou not obey my Commands ?
said Arabella, finding he did not go.
'I will, to be sure, Madam, replied he;
wishing at the same time secretly, she would
lethe know what they were.

G 3 ing

ing me this Moment: Did I not bid you get
cut of my Presence, and to speak no more
)f your inconstant Masser, whose Crimes have
rendered him the Detestation of all generous
Persons whatever ?

Sir George's Messenger, extremely surprised
at so harsh a Character of his Mailer, and the
Rage with which the Lady seemed to be actuated,
made halt to get out of her Apartment;
and, at his Return, informed his Matter, very
exactly, of' the Reception he had met with,
repeating all Lady Rel/a's Words; which, notwithstanding
the Blunders lie made in the Names
of Sydlimiris and Philcnice, Sir George understood
well enough; and found new Occasion of
wondering at the Excess of Arabella's Extravagance,
who he never imagined would have explained
herself in that Manner to his Servant.

Without endeavouring therefore to see Ara.
Ilia, he went to pay his Compliments to Sir
charles, AMr. Glanville, and Miss Glanville; to
ime last of which he said tome soft things, that
rien her extremely regret his slaying behind
made in the Country.

Not so long as was first intended; but contains,

however, a surprising Adventure
on the Road.
H E Day of their Departure being come,
they set out in a Coach and Six, attended
by several Servants on Horseback. The First

Day's Journey passed off, without any Accident
worthy relating ; but, towards the Close (,
the Second, they were alarmed by the Appearance
of three Highwaymen, well mounted,
at a small Distance.

One of the Servants, who had fires spied
them, immediately rode up to the Coach; and,
for fear of alarming the Ladies, whispered MN.
Glanville in the Ear.

Sir Charles, who was sitting next his Son, and
had heard it, cried out with too little Caution,
How's this ? Are we in any Danger of being attacked,
say you ?

Mr. Glanville, without replying, jumped
out of the Coach; at which Miss GCianv:!.e
screamed out; and, left her Father l(oulhi te.
low, whipped into her Brother's Seat, and held
him fast by the Coat.

Arabella, being in a strange Consternation a;:
all this, put her Head out of the Coach, to see
what was the Matter; and, observing Three or
Four Men of a genteel Appearance, on Hors
back, who seemed to halt, and gaze on then,
without offering to advance i

Sir, said (he to her Uncle, are they yonder;'
Knights whom you suppose will attack us ?

Ay, ay, said Sir Charles, they are Knight
of the Road indeed: I suppose we (hall have a
Bout with them ; for it will be scandalous to
deliver, since we have the Odds of our Side,
and are more than a Match for them.

Arabella, interpreting these Words in her
own Way, looked out again; and, seeing the
Robbers, who had by this time taken their
Resolution, galloping towards them, her Cous

4 hin

sin and the Servants ranging themselves of each
Side of the Coach, as if to defend them,

Hold, hold, valiant Men, laid the, as loud
as the could speak, addressing herself to the
Highwaymen; do not, by a mistaken Generosity,
hazard your Lives in a Combat, to which
the Laws of Honour do not oblige you: twere
not violently carried away, as you falsly
suppose; we go willingly along with these persons,
who are our Friends and Relations.

Hey-day ! cried Sir Charles, staring at her
with great Surprize ; what's the Meaning of all
this Do you think these Fellows will mind your
fine Speeches, Niece ?

I hope they will, Sir, said she: Then, pulling
her Cousin, shew yourself, for Heaven's Sake,
Miss, pursued she, and second my Assurances,
that we are not forced away : These generous
men come to fight for our Deliverance.
The Highwaymen, who were near enough
to hear Arabella's Voice, though they could
not distinguish her Words, gazed on her with
great Surprize; and, finding they would be very
well received, thought fit to abandon their Enterprize,
and galloped away as fast as they were
able. Some of the Servants made a Motion to
purfuethem; but Mr. Glanville sorbad it; and,
entering again into the Coach, congratulated
the Ladies upon the Escape they had.

Since these Men, said Arabella, did not come
to deliver us, out of a mistaken Notion, that
we were carried away by Force, it must necessarily
follow, they had some bad Design; and
I protest I know not who to suspect is the Author
of it, unless the Person you vanquished,

said (he to Mr. Glanville, the other Day in a
single Combat; for the disguised Edward, you
assured me, was dead: But perhaps, continued
(he, it was some Lover of Miss Glanville's,
who designed to make an Attempt to carry her
away : Methinks he was too slenderly attended
for such an hazardous Undertaking.

I'll assure you Madam, said Miss Glanville,
I have no Lovers among Highwaymen,

Highwaymen ! repeated Arabella.
Why, ay, to be sure, Madam, rejoined Sir
Charles: What do you take them for ?
For Persons of Quality, Sir, resumed arabella
; and though they came questionless, either
upon a good or bad Design, yet it cannot be
doubted, but that their Birth is illustrious;
otherwise they would never pretend either to
fight in our Defence, or to carry us away.

I vow, Niece, said Sir Charles, I can't possibly
understand you.

My Cousin, Sir, interrupted Mr. Glanville,
has been mistaken in these Persons ; and has not
yet, possibly, believed them to be Highwaymen,
who came to rob us.

There is no Question, Sir, said Arabella,
smiling, that if they did not come to defend
us, they came to rob you: But it is hard to
guess, which of us it was of whom they designed
to deprive you ; for it may very possibly
be for my Cousin's sake, as well as mine, that
this Enterprize was undertaken.

Pardon me, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, who
was willing to prevent his Father from
her Absurdities; these Men had no
ethse Design, than to rob us of our Money.

How! slid Arabella : Were these Cavaliers,
who appeared to be in so handsome a (Gain,
that I took them for Persons of prime Quality,
were they Robbers ? I have been strangely mistaken,
it seems: However, I apprehend there is
no Certainty, that your Suspicions are true; and
it may fRill be as I say, that they either came to
rescue or carry us away.

Mr. Glanville, to avoid a longer Dispute,
changed the Discourse; having observed with
Confusion, that Sir Charles, and his Sister, seemed
to look upon his beloved Cousin as one that
was out of her Senses.

Which concludes with an authentic Piece

AR A B E L LA, during the rest of this Journey,

was so wholly taken up in contemplating
upon the last Adventure, that she mixed
but little in the Conversation. Upon their
drawing near Bath, the Situation of that City
afforded her the Means of sinking a comparison
between the Valley in which it was
placed (with the Amphitheatrical View of the
His around it) and the Valley of Tempe.

'Twas in such a Place as this, said she, pursuing
her Comparison, that the fair Andronice
delivered the valiant Hortensius : And really I
upon! wist!, Our Entrance into that City might

be preceded by an Act of equal Humanity
with that of that fair Princes's

For the Gratification of that Wish, Madam,
said Mr. Glanivijiv', its necessary foIbnc Perfun
should meet with a Mlsobtrtlnc, out 'i which
you might be able to relieve him ; but i suppose
tie Benevolence ois your 1)iiofpitiuin may he
equally satisfied with not finding any Occasions
as of exercising it, when it is found.

Though it be not my Fortune to meet with
those Occasions, replied Arabella, there is n,
Reason to doubt but others do, who possible
have less Inclination to afford their Affltancc
than myself: And it is poiliole, if any otho!
than the Princess of leering had happened t,
pass by, when Hortensius was in the Hands of
the bheffalians, he would not have been rescued
from the ignominious Death he was c.;
fined to, merely for killing a Stork.

How.! interrupted Sir Charles, put a Man to
Death for killing a Stork ! Ridiculous! Pray, iT
what Part of the World did that happen ?
Among the Indians of America, I suppose.

No, Sir, said Arabella, in thessaly ; the faire'.
Part in all Macedonia, famous for the beautiful
Valley of Snipe, which excited the Curiosity
of all Travellers whatever.

No, not .', Madam, returned Sir Charles ;
for I am acquainted with several Traveller',
who never saw it, nor even mentioned it i and
if it is so famous as you say, I am surprised i
never heard of it.before.

I don't know, said Arabella, what those Travellers
thought worthy of their Notice ; bat .
am certain, that if any Chance should ccnd.al

G 6 ;.-

me into Macedonia, I would not leave it till I
1.iw the Valley of Treipc, so celebrated by all
the Poets and I-ifitoriins.

Dear Cousin, cried Glanville, who could
hardly forbear sailing, what Chance, in the
Name of Wonder, should take you into Macedonia,
at so great a Distance from your own
Country ?

And so, said Sir Charles, this famous Valley
of Tempe is in Turky. Why you muss be
very fond of travelling, indeed, Lady Bella,
if you would go into the Great Mogul's Country,
where the People are all Pagans, they say,
and worship the Devil.

The Country my Cousin speaks of, said Mr.
Glat;vill, is in the Grand Signor's Dominions:
The Great Mogul, you know, Sir-well,

interrupted Sir Charles, the Great
mogul, or the Grand Signor, 1 know not
wvlhat you call him: But I hope my Niece does
not propose to go thither.

Not unless I am forcibly carried thither, said
3oabela ; but I do determine, if that Misfortune
should ever happen to me, that I would!'
poEblc, visit the Vale of Tempe, which is
i; that Part of Greece they call Macedonia.

Then 1 am persuaded, replied Sir Charles,
you'll never see that famous Valley you talk of;
for it is not very likely you Should be forcibly
carried away into Tl:gky.

Aud why do you think it unlikely, that I
should be carried thither ?' interrupted Arabella.
Do not the same Things happen now, that
tit formerly ? And is any thing more common,
then Lad,;.i being carried, by. their Ravishers,

into Countries far distant from their own ? May
not the same Accidents happen to me, that have
happened to so many illustrious Ladies before
me ? And may I not be carried into Macedonia
by a Similitude of Destiny with that of a great
many beautiful Princesses, who, though born in
the most distant Quarters of the World, chanced
to meet at one time in the City of Alexandria,
and related their miraculous Adventures to each
other ?

And it was for that very Purpose they met,
Madam, said Mr. Glanville, smiling.

Why, truly, said Arabella, it happened very
luckily for each of them, that they were
brought into a Place where they found so many
illustrious Companions in Misfortune, to whom
they might freely communicate their Adventures,
which otherwise might, haply, have been
concealed, or, at least, have been imperfectly
delivered down to us: However, added she,
falling, if I am carried into Macedonia, and
by that means have an Opportunity of visiting
the famous Vale of Tempe, I shall take care
not to draw the Resentment of the Thessalonians
upon me, by an Indiscretion like that of Hortensius.


For be pleated to know, Sir, said (he, ad.
dressing herself to her Uncle, that his killing a
Stork, however inconsiderable a Matter it may
appear to us, was yet looked upon as a Crime
of a very atrocious Nature among the Thessalonians
i for they have a Law, which forbids,
upon Pain of Death, the killing of S',i;ks;
the Reason for which is, that Thessaly being
be infested with a prodigious Multitude

of Serpents, which are a delightful Food to
there Sorts of Fowls, they look upon them as
sacred Birds, sent by the Gods to deliver them
from there Serpents and Vipers: And though
Hortensius, being a Stranger, was pardoned
through the Intercession of the Princess Andros
they made him promise to send another
Stork into Thessaly, to the end that he might
be reputed innocent.

In which one of our Heroine's This is
justified, by some others full as whimsical.,

T H I S Piece of History, with Sir Charles's

Remarks upon it, brought them into
Bath. Their Lodgings being provided beforehand,
the Ladies retired to their differential
to repose themselves after the Fatigue
of their Journey, and did not meet again till
Supper was on Table; when Miss Glanville,
who had eagerly enquired what Company
was then in the Place, and heard there were a
great many Persons of Fashion suit arrived,
prest Arabella to go to the Pump-room the
next Morning, assuring her she would find a
very agreeable Amusement.

Arabia accordingly consented to accompany
her; and, being told the Ladies went in an Undress
of a Morning, she accommodated hei elf
to the Custom, and went in a negligent Dress;
but instead of a Capuchin, (he were something

like a Veil, of black Gauze, which covered
almost all her Face, and Part of her Waist, and
gave her a very singular Appearance.

Miss Glanville was too envious of her cousin's
Superiority in point of Beauty, to inform
her of any Oddity in her Drcfs, which The
thought might expose her to the Ridicule of
those that saw her; and Mr. Glanville was too
little a Critic in Ladies Apparel, to be sensible
that arabella was not in the Fashion; and since
every thing the wore became her extremely,
lie could not choose but think the drest admirably
well: He handed her therefore, with a
great deal of Satisfaction, into the Pump-room,
which happened to be greatly crouded
that Morning.

The Attention of most Part of the Company
was immediately engaged by the Appearance
Lady Bella made. Strangers are here most
strictly criticized, and every new Object affords
a delicious Feast of Raillery and Scandal.

The Ladies, alarmed at the Singularity of
her Dress, crouded together in Parties;' and
the Words, Who can she be ? Strange Creature!
Ridiculous! and other Exclamations of
the same Kind, were whispered very intelligibly.


The Men were struck with her Figure,
veiled as The was: Her fine Stature, the beautiful
Turn of her Person, the Grace and Elegance
of her Motion, attracted all their Notice:
The Phenomena of the Veil, however,
gave them great Disturbance. So lovely a Person
seemed to promise the Owner bad a Face
not unworthy cf it but that was totally hid

fl i in

from their View: For Arabella, at her Entrance
into the Room, had pulled the Gauze
quite over her Face, following therein the Custom
of the Ladies in Clelia, and the Grand Cyrus,
who, in mixed Companies, always hid their
Faces with great Care.

The Wits, and Pretty-Fellows, railed at the
envious Covering, and compared her to the
Sun obscured by a Cloud ; while the Beaux
dined the horrid Innovation, and expressed a
Fear, lest it should grow into a Fashion.

Some of the wiser Sort took her for a foreigner;
others, of still more Sagacity, supposed
her a Scots Lady, covered with her Plaid; and
a third Sort, infinitely wiser than either, concluded
(he was a Spanifh Nun, that had escaped
from a Convent, and had not yet quitted her
Veil.

Arabella, ignorant of the Diversity of Opinions,
to which her Appearance gave Rise, was
taken up in discoursing with Mr. Glanville,
upon the medicinal Virtue of the Springs, the
Oeconomy of the Baths, the Nature of the
Diversions, and such other Topics, as the
Objects around them furnished her with.

In the mean time, Miss Glanville was got
amidst a Croud of her Acquaintance, who had
hardly paid the Civilities of a first Meeting, before
they eagerly inquired, who that Lady she
brought with her was.

Miss Glanville informed them, that Ihe washer
Cousin, and Daughter to the deceased Marquis
of adding with a Steer, That Ihe had
been brought up in the Country; knew nothing
of the World; and had some very peculiar Notions,

as you may see, said file, by that odd
kind of Covering she wears.

Her Name and Quality were presently whispered
all over the Roam: The Men, hearing
the was a great Heiress, found greater Beauties
to admire in her Person: The Ladies, aw'd
by the Sanction of Quality, dropt their Ridicule
on her Drcfs, and began to quote examples
of Whims full as inexcusable.

One remembered, that Lady 7- T- al-always
wore her Ruffles reversed; that the
Countess of - went to Court in a Farthingale
; that the Duchess of - sat astride
upon a Horse ; and a certain Lady of great
Fortune, and nearly allied to Quality, because
the was not dignified with a Title, invented a
new one for herself; and directed her Servants
to say in speaking to her, Your Honours, which
afterwards became a Custom among all her Acquaintance;
who mortally offended her, if
they omitted that Instance of Repeat

H A P. V.
Containing some historical Anecdotes, the

Truth of which may possibly be doubted,
as they are not to be found in any of the
Historians.
AFTER a Short Stay in the Room, Arabella

expressing a Desire to return home,
Mr. Glanville conducted her out. Two Gentlemen
of his Acquaintance attending Miss Glanville,

Sir Charles detained them to Breakfast;
by which means they had an Opportunity of
satisfying their Curiosity ; and beheld Araber/,
divested of that Veil, which had, as they laid;
and 'tis probable they said no more than they
thought, concealed one of the finest Faces in
the World.

Its Glanville had the Mortification to see
both the Gentlemen so charmed with the Sight
of her Cousin's Face, that for a long time she
sat wholly neglected ; but the Seriousness other
Behaviour, giving some little Disgust to the
younger cf them, who was what the Ladies
call a Pretty-Fellow, a dear Creature, and the
aloft diverting Man in the World; he applied
himself wholly to Mils Glanville, and soon engaged
her in a particular Conversation.

Mr. Seisin, so was the other Gentleman
called, was of a much graver Cat : He affected
to be thought deep-read in History, and never
failed to take all Opportunities of displaying
his Knowlege of Antiquity, which was indeed
but very superficial ; but having some few Anecdotes
by Heart, which he would take Occasion
to introduce as often as he could, he passed
among many Persons for one, who, by Application
and Study, had acquired an universal
Knowlege of antient History.

Speaking of any particular Circumstance, le
would fix the Time, by computing the Year
with the Number of the Olympiad.

It happened, he would say, in the 141ft
Olympiad.

Effet on his Audience, and always procured
him a great Degree of Attention.

This Gentleman hitherto had no Opportunity
of displaying his Knowlege of History,
the Discourse having wholly turned upon News,
and other Trifles ; when ]arabella, after some
more Inquiries concerning the Place, remarked,
that there was a very great Difference between
the medicinal Waters at Bath, and the
fine Springs at the Foot of the Mountain
in Greece, as well in their (Qualities, as
manner of using them ; andes am of Opinion,
added she, that Bath, famous as it is for restoring
Health, is less frequented by infirm
Persons, than the famous Springs of Thermopylae
were by the Beauties of Greece, to whom those
Waters have the Reputation of giving new
Lustre.

Mr. Selvin, who, with all his Reading, had
never met with any Account of these celebrated
Grecian Springs, was extremely disconcerted at
not being able to continue a Conversation,
which the Silence of the reit of the Company
made him imagine, was directed wholly to
him.

The Shame he conceived at seeing himself
posed by a Girl, in a Matter which so immediately
belonged to him, made him resolve to
draw himself out of this Dilemma at any Rate;
aud, though he was far from being convinced,
that there were no such Springs at 7Termopyla as
Arabella mentioned ; yet he resolutely maintained,
that she must be mistaken in their Situation
; for, to his certain Knowledge, there were

no medicinal Waters at the Foot of that Mountain.


Arabella, who could not endure to be contradicted
in what flie took to be so incontestable
a Faa, reddened with Vexation at his unexpected
Denial.

It should seem, said file, by your Discourse,
that you are unacquainted with many material
Passages, that passed among very illustrious
Persons there; and if you knew any thing of
Pisistratus the Athenian, you would know, that
an Adventure he had at those Baths, laid the
Foundation of all those great Designs, which he
afterwards effected, to the total Suave-fion of
the Athenian Government.

Mr. Selvin, surprised that this Piece of History
had likewise escaped his Observation, resolved,
however, not to give up his Point.

I think, Madam, replied he, with great
Self-sufficiency, that I am pretty well acquainted
with every thing which relates to the affairs
of the Athenian Commonwealth; and know
by what Steps Pisistratus advanced himself to
the Sovereignty. It was a great Stroke of Policy
in him, said he, turning to Mr. Glanville,
indeed, to wound himself, in order to get a
Guard assigned him.

You are mistaken, Sir, said Arabella, if you
believe, there was any Truth in the Report of
his having wounded himself: It was done, either
by his Rival Lycurgus or Theories; who believing
him still to be in Love with the fair
Corinth, whom he courted, took that Way to
get rid of him: Neither is it true, that Ambition
alone inspired Pisistratus with a Design ot

enslaving his Country: Those Authors who say
so, must know little of the Springs and Motives
of his Conduct. It was neither Ambition nor
Revenge, that made him at as he did ; it was
the violent Affection he conceived for the beautiful
Chlorate, whom he first saw at the famous
Baths of Thermopylae, which put him upon those
Designs; for, seeing that Lycurgus, who was
not his Rival in Ambition, but Love, would
certainly become the Possessor of Chlorate, unless
he made himself Tyrant of Athens, he had
recourse to that violent Method, in order to
preserve her for himself.

1 protest, Madam, said Mr. Sclvin, casting
down his Eyes in great Confusion at her superior
Knowlege in History, these Particulars
have all escaped my Notice ; and this is the
first time I ever understood, that Pififratuswas
violently in Love; and that it was not Ambition,
which made him aspire to Sovereignty.

I do not remember any Mention of this in
Plutarch, continued he, rubbing his Forehead,
or any of the Authors who have treated on the
Affairs of Greece.

Very likely, Sir, replied Arabella; but you
will see the whole Story of Pisistratus's Love
for Clhorantc, with the Effets it produced, related
at large in Scudery.

Scudery, Madam ! said the sage Mr. Solving
never read that Historian.

No, Sir! replied Arabella, then your Reading
has been very confined.

I know, Madam, said he, that Herodotus,
Thucydides, and Plutarch, have indeed quoted
him frequently.

I am surprised, Sir, said Mr. Glanville, who
was excessively diverted at this Discovery of
his great Ignorance and Affectation, that you
have not read that famous Historian ; especially,
as the Writers you have mentioned quote him
so often.

Why, to tell you the Truth, Sir, said he;
though he was a Roman; yet it is objected to
him, that he wrote but indifferent Latin; with
no Purity or Elegance; and-you

are quite mistaken, Sir, interrupted
Arabella; the great Scudery was a Frenchman;
and both his Clelia and Armaments were written
in French.

A Frenchman was he ? said Mr. Selvin, with
a lofty Air: Oh! then, 'tis not surprising,
that I have not read him: I read no Authors,
but the Antients, Madam, added he, with a
Look of Self-applause; I cannot relish the Moderns
at all: I have no Taste for their Way of
Writing.

But Scudery mush needs be more ancient
than Thucydides, and the rest of those Greek
Historians you mentioned, said Mr. Glanville:
How ells could they quote him ?

Mr. Selvin was here so utterly at a Loss, that
he could not conceal his Confusion: He held
down his Head, and continued silent; while the
Beau, who had listened to the latter Part of their
Discourse; exerted his supposed Talent of
Raillery against the unhappy Admirer of the
antient Authors; and increased his Confusion
by a thousand Sarcasms, which gave more Diversion
to himself, than any body else.

CHAP. VI.
YWicb contains some excellent Rules for

M R. Glanville, who had too much Politeness

and Good nature to insist too long
upon the Ridicule in the Character of his Acquaintance,
changed the Discourse: And Arabella,
who had observed, with some Concerns
the ill-judged Raillery of the young Beau, took
Occasion to decry that Species of Wit; and
gave it as her Opinion, that it was very dangerous
and unpleasing.

For, truly, said the, it is almost impossible
to use it without being hated or feared and
whoever gets a Habit of it, is in Danger of
wronging all the Laws of Friendship and Humanity.
Certainly, pursued she, looking at the Beau,
it is extremely unjust to rally one's Friends, and
particularAcquaintance: First, choose them welland
be as nice as you please in the Choice; but
when you have chosen them, by no means play
upon them: 'Tis cruel and malicious, to divert
one's self at the Expence of one's Friend.

However, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, who
was charmed to hear her talk so rationally, you
may give People Leave to rally their Enemies.


Truly, resumed Arabella, I cannot allow
that, any more than upon Friends; artillery
is the poorer kind of Revenge that can be taken:

Methinks, it is mean to rally Persons who
have a fmallShare of Merit; since, haply, their
Defects were born with them, and not of their
own acquiring; and it is great Injustice to def-cant
upon one slight Fault in Men of Parts, to
the Prejudice of a thousand good Qualities.

For aught I see, Madam, said the Beau, you
will not allow one to rally any body.

I am of Opinion, Sir, said Arabella, that
there are very few proper Objets for Raillery;
and still fewer, who can rally well: The Talent
of Raillery ought to be born with a Person;
no Art can infuse it; and those who endeavour
to rally in spite of Nature, will be Ib
far from diverting others, that they will become
theObje&s of Ridicule themselves.

Many other pleasing Qualities of Wit maybe
acquired by Pains and Study, but Raillery
muss be the Gift of Nature: It is not enough
to have many lively and agreeable Thoughts;
but there muss be such an Expression, as mute
convey their full Force and Meaning; the
Air the Aspect, the Tone of the Voice, and
every Part in general, muss contribute to its
Perfection.

There ought also to be a great Distance between
Raillery and Satire, so that one may never
be mistaken for the other: Raillery ought
indeed to surprise, and sensibly touch, those to
whom it is directed; but I would not have the
Wounds it makes, either deep or laying : Let
those who feel it, be hurt like Persons, who,
gathering Roses, are pricked by the Thorns,
and find a sweet Smell to make amends.

6 ¬∑

I would have Raillery raise tenancy, and
quicken the Imagination, the Fire of its Wit
should only enable us to trace its Original,
and fine as the Stars do, but not burn.
Yet, after all, I cannot greatly approve of
Raillery, or cease to think it dangerous; and,
to pursue my Comparison, said she, with an
inchanting Smile, Persons who possess the
true Talent of Raillery, are like Comets ; they
are seldom seen, and arc at once admir'd and
sear'd.

I protest, Lady Bella, said Sir Charles, who
had listen'd to her with many Signs of Admiration,
you speak like an Orator.

One would not imagine, interrupted Mr.
Glanville, who saw Arabella in tome C-infufii4
at the coarse Praise her Uncle gave her, that
my Cousin could speak so accurately of a Quality
she never practises: And 'cis easy to judge
by what Ihe has said, that no body can rally
finer than herself, if she cafes.

Mr. Srlvil, tho' he bore her a Grudge for
knowing more History than he did, yet assured
her, that ile had given the best Rules imaginable
for rallying well. But the Beau, whom
the had silenced by her Reproof, was extremely
angry ; and, supposing it would mortify her t
see him pay Court to her Cousin, he redoubles
his Assiduities to Miss Glanville, who was highly
delighted at seeing Arabella lets taken Notice of
by this gay Gentleman, than herself.

VoL. II. H Chap,

CHA P. VII.
In which the Author condescends to be ,wry

minute in the Descriptions of our Heroic's
Dress.
'! E'
H E Indifference of Mr. Sines, convent

king Mils Glanville, that Arabella was
ices to be dreaded than she imagin'd, (he had no
Reluctance at living her prepare for her publick
Appearance the next Ball Night.

Having confuted her Fancy in a rich Silver
Stuff; the had bought for that Purpose, a Person
was lent for to make it; and /lrahella, who
followed no Fashion hut her own Taste, which
was form'd on the Manners of the Heroines,
order'd the Woman to make her a Rbe after
the same Model as the Princess 'julia's.

The Mantua-maker, who thought it might
do her great Prejudice with her new Customer,
to acknowledge (he knew nothing of the Princess
Julia, or the Fashion of her Gown, replied
at Random, and with great Pertness,

That, that Taste was quite out; and, the
would advise her Ladyship to have her Oaths
made in the presented, which was far more
becoming.

You can never persuade me, said Arabella,
that any Fashion can be more becoming than
that of the Princess 7tlia's, who was the most
gallant Princess upon Earth, and knew better
than any other, how to set off her Charms.
It may indeed be a little obsolete now, pursued

she, for the Fashion could not but alter a little
in the Compass of near two thousand Years.

Two thousand Years! Madam, said the W c-
man, in a great Surprize; Lord help us Tradespeople,
if they did not alter a thousand Times
in as many Days ! I thought your Ladyship
was speaking of the last Month's Taste; which,
as I said before, is quite out now.

Well, replied I'lA;blla, let the present Mode
be what it will, I infill upon having my Cloaths
made after the Pattern of the beautiful Daughter
of Alugtlts ; being convinced, that none
other can be half so becoming.

What Falhion was that, pray, Madam, said
the Woman ? I never saw it.

How, replied arabella, Have you already forgot
the Falhion of the Princess '"/u.a's Robe,
which you said was wore but last Month ? Or,
are you ignorant that the Princess a/dlia, and
the Daughter of lugitfius, is the same Person ?

I protest, Madam, said the Woman, extremely
confus'd, I had forgot that, till you
called it to my Mind.

Well, said Arabella, make me a Robe in the
same Taste.

'Ihe Mantua-maker was now wholly at a
Loss in what Manner to behave; for, being
conscious that the knew nothing of the Princes
julia's Fashion, (fie could not undertake to
make it without Directions; and she was afraid
of discovering her Ignorance by asking for any;
so that her Silence and Embarrassment persia-dine
Arabella (he knew nothing of the Matter,
(he dismist her with a small Present, for the
Trouble (he had given her, and had tRecouri:

H- 2 toto

her usual Expedient, which was, to make
one of her Women, who understood a little of
the Mantua.making Business, make a Robe for
her, after her own Directions.

Miss Glanville, who imagin'd she had font
for Work-women, in order to have Cloaths
made in the modern Tafle, was surprized at her
Entrance into her Chamber, to see her dressing
for the Ball, in a Habit singular to the last
Degree.

She wore no Hoop, and the Blue and Silver
Stuft' of her Robe, was only kept by its own
*Richness, from hanging close about her. It
was quite open round her Breast, which was
(hated with a rich Border of Lace; and clasping
close to her Waifs, by small Knots of Diamonds,
descended in a sweeping Train on the
Ground.

The Sleeves were short, wide, and flashed,
fastned in different Places with Diamonds, and
her Arms were partly hid by half a Dozen Falls
of Ruffles. Her Hair, which fell in very easy
Ringlets on her Neck, was plac'd with great
Care and Exactness round her lovely Face; and
the Jewels and Ribbons, which were all her'
Headdress, disposed to the greatest Advantage.

Upon the whole, nothing could be more singularly
becoming than her Dress; or set off
with greater Advantage the striking Beauties of
her Person.

Miss Glanville, tho' she was not displeased to
see her persist in her Singularity of Dress ; yet
could not behold her look so lovely in it, without
feeling a secret Uneasiness ; but consoling
heroics with the Hopes of the Ridicule flie

would occasion, she assumed a chearful Ai:,
approv'd her Tafle in the Choice of her (C -
lours, and went with her at the usual Hoeil.
to the Rooms, attended by MIr. Gliwi'.>,
Mr. Selvin, and the young Beau we have wi .
merely mention'd.

The Surprize Arabella's unusual Appearance
gave to the whole Company, was very visible
to every one but herself.

The Moment (he enter'd the Room, everyone
whispered the Person next to them; and for
some Moments, nothing was heard but the
Words, the Princess julia; which was eccho'
at every Corner, and at last attract her Observation.


Mr. Glanville, and the rest of the Company
with her, were in some Confusion at tile universal
Exclamation, which they imagin'd wI's
occasioned by the Singularity of her Habit;
tho' they could not conceive, why they gave
her that Title. Had they known the Adventure
of the Mantua-maker, it would doubtless,
have easily occurr'd to them ; for the XWomaR
had no sooner left Arabella, than (he related
the Conference she had with a Lady newly arriv'd,
who had requir'd her to mako a Robe in
the Manner of the Princess Julia's ; and dismissed
her, because she did not understand the
Fashions that prevail'd two thousand Years ago.

This Story was quickly dispersed, and for its
Novelty, afforded a great deal of Diversion;
every one long'd to see a Fashion of such Antiquity;
and expected the Appearance of the
princess julia with great Impatience.

H 3 It

It is not to be doubted but much Mirth was
:rcafui'd up for her Appearance; and the occasional

humorist had already prepared his
Jeff, when the Sight of the devoted
:sir One replied his Vivacity, and the designed
Ridicule of the whole Assembly.

Scarce had t!e first tumultuous Whisper escaped
the Lips of each Individual, when they found
themselves aw'd to Respect by that irresistible
Charm in the Person of Arabella, which commanded
Reverence and Love from all who beheld
her.

Her noble Air, the native Dignity in her
Looks, the inexpressible Grace which accompany'd
all her Motions, and the consummate
Loveliness of her Form, drew the Admiration
of the whole Assembly.

A respectful Silence succeeded, and the Astonishment
her Beauty occasioned, left them no
Room to descant on the Absurdity of her Dress.

Miss Glanville, who felt a malicious Joy at
the Sneers the expected would be cast on her
Cousin, was greatly disappointed at the Deference
which seemed to be paid her; and to vent
some Part of her Spleen, took occasion to mention
her Surprize, at the Behaviour of the
Company on their Entrance ; wondering what
they could mean by whispering the Princess
julia to one another.

I assure you, said Arabella, smiling, I am not
less surprized than you at it; and since they directed
their Looks to me at the same Time, I
fancy they either took me for some Princess of
the Name of julia, who is expected here tonight,

or efe flatter me with some Resemblance
to the beautiful Daughter of .dAgil/ilus.

The Comparison, Madam, said Mr. Selvit,
who took all Occasions to thew his Reading, is
too injurious to you, for I am of Opinion you
as much excel that licentious Lady in the Beauties
of your Person, as you do in the Qualities
of your Mind.

I never heard Licentiousness imputed to the
Daughter of .augustus Cefar, said .arabella;
and the most her Enemies can say of her, is,
that the loved Admiration, and would permit
herself to be beloved, and to be told so, without
stewing any Signs of Displeasure.

Bless me, Madam, interrupted Mr. Selvin,
how strangely do you mistake the Character of
Julia: Tho' the Daughter of an Emperor,
she was, pardon the Expression, the mol abandon'd
Prostitute in Rome; many of her Intrigues
are recorded in History; but to mention only
one, Was not her infamous Commerce with
Ovid, the Cause of his Banishment ?

C JA P. VIII.
Some Reflexion very fit, and others very

unfit for an Assembly-Room.
Y U speak in france Terms, replied Arabella,

blushing, of a Princes, who if she
was not the molt reserved and severe Person in
tie World, was yet nevertheless, absolutely
chaste.

4. I know

I know there were People who represented
her Partiality for Ovid in a very unfavourable
Light; but that ingenious Poet, when he related
his History to the great Agrippa, told him
in Confidence all that had pass'd between him
and the Princess Julia, than which nothing
could be more innocent tho' a little indiscreet.
For, 'tis certain that she permitted him to love
her, and did not condemn him to any rigorous
Punishment for daring to tell her so; yet, for
all ths:, as I said before, tho' she was not altogether
so austere as she ought to have been, yet
the was nevertheless a mons virtuous Princess.

Mr. Selvin, not daring to contradict a Lady
whose extensive Reading had furnished her with
Anecdotes unknown almost to any Body else,
by his Silence confessed her Superiority. But
Mr. Glanville, who knew all these Anecdotes
were drawn from Romances, which he found
contradicted the known Facts in History, and
assigned the most ridiculous Causes for Things
of the greatest Importance; could not help
milling at the Facility with which Mr. Selvin
gave inst those idle Absurdities. For notwithstanding
his Affectation of great Reading, his
superficial Knowledge of History made it extremely
easy to deceive him ; and as it was his
Custom to mark in his Pocket-Book all the
Scraps of History he heard introduced into conversation,
and retail them again in other Company;
he did not doubt but he would make a
Figure with the curious Circumstances Arabella
had furnished him with.

Arabella observing Mr. tinsel by his familiar
Bows, significant Smiles, and easy Salutations,

was acquainted with the greater Part of the
Assembly, told him, that the did not doubt but
he knew the Adventures of many Perfonswhom
they were viewing i and that he would do hera
Pleasure, if he would relate some of them.

Mr. Tinsel was charm'd with a Request which
afforded him an Opportunity of gratifying a favourite
Inclination, and feating hinfclt near
her immediately, was beginning to obey hee
Injunctions, when (he gracefully intreated him
to stay a Moment; and calling to Mr. Glanville
and his Sister, who were talking to Mr. Selvii,
ask'd them if they chose to partake of a more
rational Amusement than Dancing, and linftn
to the Adventures es some illustrious Persons,
which Mr. 'Tinct had promis'd to relate, -

I assure you, Madam, said Mr. G'anviil',
smiling, you will find that a less innocent
Amusement than Dancing.

Why so, Sir, replied Arabella, since it is not
an indiscreet Curiosity which prompts me to a
Desire of hearing the Histories Mr. Tinsel has
promis'd to entertain me with; but rather a
Hope of hearing something which may at once
improve and delight me; something which
may excite my Admiration, engage my Esteem,
or influence my Praise.

'Twas doubtless, with such Motives as these,
that we find Princesses and Ladies of the most
illustrious Rank, in Clelia and the Grand Cyrus,
listning to the Adventures of Persons, in whom
they were probably as little interested, as weare
in there around us. Kings, Princes, and
Commanders of Armies, thought it was no
Late of their Time, in the midst of the

H 5 lurrr

Hurry and Clamour of a alp,. to life many
Hours to the Relation of one single History,
and not fill'd with any extraordinary Events
but haply a simple Recital of common Occurrences:
The great Cyrus) while he was busy
mi reducing all fia. to his Yoke, heard nevertheless,
the Histories of all the considerable persons
in. the Camp, besides those of Strangers,.
and even, his Enemies. If were was therefore
any thing either criminal or mean,, in hearing.
d- Adventures of others,. do you imagine so
tntn great and illustrious Persons wouil have.
'ig i in to such an Amusement ?

.Aster this Ardea turned gravely about to
^'~1r. TirnJ, and told him,. he was at Liberty to
bigiin his Recital

The Beau, a little disconcerted by the
enmity with-which tate requested his information,
knew not how to begin with informality
rhat'he saw was required of him ; and
therefore sat silent for a few Moments; which
arabella supposed was to recall to his Memory
all the Passages he propos'd to relate,

His Perplexity would probably have increas'd
instead of lessening by the profound Silence
*which fie observed,. had not Miss Glarivi!c
sated herself with-a sprightly Air on the other
Side of him, and directing his Eves to a tall
handsome Woman that had just enter'd, ask'd
him pleasantly, to teller Hilary if he knew it.

Mir. .ilfel brought into his.ufual Track, by
this Question, anfweil'd smiling, That the history
of that Lady was yet.a Secret,, or known
hut: t very. fkw , 'but.imy Ijteligec.ce, adde

he, is generally tie c a- !,;l and may always
be depended on.

Perhaps, situ '. th'
theI , i)s one of your
Acquaintance:, .\-i'd you with the Recitals
her Ad c from her own Mouth.

No, really,. MiMltm, infwel'd Mr. Tinsel,
surprized at tb great Similarity of Arable,
for so he understood it; the Lady, I believe, is
not so communicative: And to shy the Truth,
I (hould not chuse to hear her Adventures from
herself, since file certainly would suppress the
most material Circumstances.

In a Word, said he, lowering his Voice,
That Lady was for many Years the Mistress of
a young military Nobleman, whom she was so
complaisant to follow in all his Campaigns,.
Marches, Sieges,, and every Inconveniency of
War: He married her in Gibraltar, from
whence he is lately arriv'd, and introduc'd his
new Lady to his noble Brother, by whom she
was not unfavourably receiv'd. 'Tis worth'
remarking, that this same haughty Peer thought
fit to resent with implacable Obstinacy, the
Marriage of another of his Brothers, with the
Widow of a brave Officer, of considerable
Rank in the Army. 'Tis true, (fe was several
Years older than the young Lord, and had no
Fortune ; but the Duke assigned other Reasons
for his Displeasure: He complain'd loudly, that
his Brother had dishonoured the Nobility of his.
Birth, by this Alliance, and continued his resentment
till the Death of the young Hero, who.
gave many remarkable Proofs of his, Courage
and Fortitude upon several Occasions,. and died'
gloriously before the Walls of Carthage;

H 6 ' leaving',

leaving his disconsolate Lady a Widow a second
Time, with the Acquisition of a Title
indeed, but a very small Addition to her Fortune.


Observe that gay, splendid Lady, I beseech
you, Madam, pursued he, turning to Arabella;
how aflieedly she looks and talks, and throws
her Eyes around the Room, with a haughty
Self-sufficiency in her Aspect, and insolent Contempt
for every Thing but herself. Her Habit,
her Speech, her Motions, are all French ;
nothing in England is able to please her; the
People so dull, so aukwardly polite, the Manners
so gross; no Delicacy, no Elegance, no
Magnificence in their Persons, Houses, or diversions;
every Thing is so distasteful), there
is no living in such a Place. One may crawl
about, indeed, she says, and make a shift to
breathe in the odious Country, but one cannot
be said to live; and with all the Requisites to
render Life delightful, here, one can only suffer,
not enjoy it.

Would one not imagine, pursued he, this
fine Lady was a Person of very exalted Rank,
who has the Sanction of Birth, Riches, and
Grandeur for her extraordinary Pride ; and yet
Ihe is no other than the Daughter of an Innkeeper
at Spa, and had the exalted Poet assigned
L er of attending new Lodgers to their apartments,
acquainting them with all the Conveniences
of the Place, answering an humble
Question or two concerning what Company
was in the Town, what Scandal was stirring,
anlG the like,

One of our great Sea Commanders going
thither for his Health, happen'd to lodge at this
Inn; and was so struck with her Charms, that
he marry'd her in a few Weeks, and soon after
brought her to England.

Such was the Origin of this fantaftick Lady;
whole insupportable Pride and ridiculous As-station,
draws Contempt and Aversion wherein
appears.

Did I not tell you, Madam, interrupted
Mr. Glanville, that the Amusement you had
chore was not so innocent as Dancing ? What a
deal of Scandal has Mr. Tinsel utter'd in the
Compass of a few Minutes ?

I allure you, replied Arabella, I know not
what to make of the Histories he has been relating.
I think they do not deserve that Name,
and are rather detached Pieces of Satire on
particular Persons, than a serious Relation of
Facts. I confess my Expectations from this
Gentleman have not been answered.

I think, however, Madam, said Mr. Glanville,
we may allow that there is a negative
Merit in the Relations Mr. Tinsel has made;
for, if he has not shewn us any Thing to approve,
he has at least shewn us what to condemn.

The Ugliness of Vice, reply'd Arabella,
ought only to be represented to the Vicious;
to, whom Satire, like a magnifying Glass, may
aggravate every Defect, in order to make its
Deformity appear more hideous; but since its
End is only to reprove and amend, it (hould
never be addressed to any but those who come
within its Correction, and may be the better
for it; A virtuous Mind need not be shewn

the Deformity of Vice, to make it be hated and
avoided; the more pure and uncorrupted our
Ideas are, the les hall we be influenced by Example.
A natural Propensity to Virtue or
Vice often determines the Choice: 'Tis sufficient
therefore to slew a good Mind what it
ought to pursue, though a bad one must be told
what to avoid. In a Word, one ought to be
always incited, the other always restrained.

I vow, Lady Bella, said Miss Glanville,
you'd make one think one came here to hear a
Sermon ; you are so very grave, and talk upon
such high-flown Subject. What Harm was
there in what Mr T'fic was telling us ? It
would be hard indeed, if one might not divert
one's self with other Peoples Faults.

I am afraid, Miss, said Arabella, those who
can divert themselves with the Faults of others,.
are not behind hand in affording Diversion.
And that very Inclination, added she, smilingly,
to hear other Peoples Faults, may by those very
People, be condemned as one, and afford them
the same Kind of ill-natur'd Pleasure you are
so desirous of.

Nay, Madam, return'd Miss Glanville, your
Ladyship was the first who introduc'd the Discourse
you condemn so much. Did not you
desire Mr.Tzfelto tell you Histories about the
Company ; and. ask my Brotherhood me, to.
erne and hear them ?
'Tis true, reply'd Arabella that I did desire
you to partake with me of a pleasing and
rational Amusement, for touch f imagin'd
Mr. TinfiPs Histories. might afford ; far from a
Detail of Vices, Folks, and Irregularities, I;

expect to have heard the Adventures of some
illustrious Personages related; between whose
Acts ;is, and those of the Heroes and Heroines
of Antiquity I might have found some resemblance.


For Influence, I hliu'd to have heard imitated
the sublime Courage of C
Clclia, who, to save
her Honour from the Attempts of the impious
TI quin, leap'd into the River Tiber, and swan
to the other Side ; or the noble Resolution of
the incomparable Candace, who, to escape out
of the Hands of her Ravisher, the Pirate Tc-
ndsarns, set Fire to his Vessel with her own
Hands, and committed herself to the Mercy of
the Waves: Or, the Constancy and Affection
of a Mariana, who, for the Sake of a Cyrus,
refused the richest Crowns in the World, and
braved the Terrors of Death to preserve herself
for him.

As for the' IM.en, I hoped to have heard of
some who might have almost equall'd the great
Oroondates, the invincible artaban, the valiant
Juba, the renowned Plainness. and many
thousand Her es of Antiquity ; those glorious
Exploits in War, aud unshaken Constancy in
Love, have given them an immortal Fame.

While Arabella was uttering this long Speech,
with great Emotion, Mi's Glanville, with a fly
Look at the Beau, gave him to understand,
that was her Cousin's Foible.

Mr 7iJfl, however,. not able to comprehend
the Meaning of what she said, listen'd to
her with many Signs of Perplexity and Wonder,

Mr. Sclvin in secret repin'd at her prodigious
Knowledge of History; and Mr, Glanville,

with his Eyes six'd on the Ground, bit his Lips
almost through with Madness.

In the mean Time, several among the Company,
desirous of hearing what the strange
Lady was saying so loud, and with so much
Eagerness and Emotion, gather'd round them;
which Mr. Glanville observing, and fearing
Arabella would expose herself fill farther, whispered
his Sister to get her away if possible.

Miss Glanville, the very unwilling, obey'd
his Injunctions; and complaining of a sudden
Head-each, Arabella immediately propos'd retiring,
which was joyfully complied with by
Mr. Glanville, who with the other Gentlemen
attended them home.

Being a Chapter of the Satirical Kind.
A T their Return, Sir Charles told his Niece,

That she had now had a Specimen of the
World, and some of the fashionable Amusements;
and ask'd her, how Ihe had been entertain'd.


Why, truly, Sir, replied the, smiling, I
have brought away no great Relish for a Renewal
of the Amusement I have partaken of
To-night. If the World, in which you seem
to think I am but new initiated, affords only
there Kinds of Pleasures, I shall very soon regret
the Solitude and Books I have quitted.

Why pray, said Miss Glanville ? What King
of Amusements did your Ladyflip expect to
find in the World ? And what was there disagreeable
in your Entertainment to Night ? I
am sure there is no Place in England, except
London, where there is so much good Company
to be met with, as here. The Assembly was
very numerous and brillant, and one can be at
no Loss for Amusements: The Pump-room in
the Morning, the Parade, and the Rooms, in
the Evening, with little occasional Parties of
Pleasure, will find one sufficient Employment,
and leave none of ene's Time to lye useless upon
one's Hand.

I am of Opinion, replied Arabella, that
one's Time is far from being well employ'd in
the Manner you portion it out: And People
who spend theirs in such trifling Amusements,
must certainly live to very little Purpose.

What room, I pray you, does a Lady give
for high and noble Adventures, who consumes
her Days in Dressing, Dancing, listening to
Songs, and ranging the Walks with People as
thoughtless as herself? How mean and contemptible
a Figure must life spent in such idle
Amusements make in History ? Or rather, Are
not such Persons always buried in Oblivion,
and can any Pen be found who would condescend
to record such inconsiderable Actions?

Nor can I persuade myself, added the, that
any of horsemen whom I saw at the Assembly,
with Figures so feminine, Voices so soft, such
tripping Steps, and unmeaning Gestures, have
ever signalized either their Courage or constancy;

but might be overcome by their Enemy
in Battle, or be false to their Mistress in Love.

Law ! Cousin, reply'd Miss Glanville, you
are always talking of Battles and Fighting. Do
you expect that Persons of Quality, and fine
Gentlemen, will go to the Wars ? What business
have they to fight ? That belongs to the
Officers.

Then every fine Gentleman is an Officer,
said Arabella ; and some other Title ought to
be found out for Men who do nothing but
Dance and Dress.

I could never have imagined, interrupted
Mr. Tinsel, surveying Arabella, that a Lady so
elegant and gay in her own Appearance, should
have an Aversion to Pleasure and Magnificence.

I assure you, Sir, replied Arabella, I have
an Aversion to neither: On the contrary, I
am a great Admirer of both. But my Ideas
of Amusements and Grandeur are probably
different from yours.

I will allow the Ladies to be sollicitous about
their Habits, and dress with all the Care and
Elegance they are capable of; but such Trifles
are below the Consideration of a Man, who
ought not to owe the Dignity of his Appearance
to the Embroidery on his Coat, but to
his high and noble Air, the Grandeur of his
Courage, the Elevation of his Sentiments, and
the many heroick Actions he has perform'd.

Such a Man will dress his Person with a
graceful Simplicity, and lavish all his Gold and
Embroidery upon his Armour, to render him
conspicuous in the Day of Battle, The Plume;
in his Helmet will look more graceful in the

Field, than the Feather in his Hat at a Ball;
and Jewels blaze with more Propriety on his
Shield and Cuirass in Battle, than glittering on
his Finger in a Dance.

Do not imagine, however, pursued file, that
I absolutely condemn Dancing, and think it a
Diversion wholly unworthy of a Hero.

History has recorded some very famous Balls,
at which the loaf illustrious Persons in the
World have appear'd.

Cyrus the Great, we are inform'd, open'.l a
Ball with the divine Mandana at Sardis. The
renown'd King of Scythia danc'd with the
Princess Cleopatra at Alexandria. The brave
Laomedon with the fair Candace at Ethiopia;
but there Diversions were taken but seldom,
and considered indeed as an Amusement, not asa
Part of the Business of Life.

How would so many glorious Battles have
been fought, Cities taken, Ladies rescu'd, and
other greatand noble Adventures been atchiev'd,
if the Men, sunk in Sloth and Effeminacy, had
continually followed the Sound of a Fiddle,
sauntered in Publick Walks, and tattled over a
Tea-table.

I vow, Cousin, said Miss Glanville, you are
infinitely more severe in your Censures than
Mr. Tinsel was at the Assembly. You had little
Reason methinks to be angry with him.

All I have said, reply'd Arabella, were the
natural Inference from your own Account of
the Manner in which People live here. When
Assigns are a Censure upon themselves, the Reciter
will always be considered as a Satirist.

CHAP. X.
I# which born Heroine hussites her own

Notions by sone very illustrious Examples,

M R. Selvin and Mr. Tinsel, who had listened
V.
V attentively to this Discourse of arabella,
took Leave as soon as it was ended,
and went away with very different Opinions
of her.

Mr. tinsel declaring she was a Fool, and had
no Knowledge of the World, and Mr. Selvin
convinc'd Ihe was a Wit, and very learn'd in
Antiquity.

Certainly, said Mr. Selvin, in Support of his
Opinion, the Lady has great Judgment ; has
been capable of prodigious Application, as is
apparent by her extensive Reading: Then her
Memory is quite miraculous. I protest, I am
quite charm'd with her: I never met with
such a Woman in my Life.

Her Cousin, in my Opinion, reply'd Mr.
I'nsel, is infinitely beyond her in every Merit,
but Beauty. How sprightly and free her conversation
? What a thorough Knowledge of
the World ? So true a Taste for polite Amusements,
and a Fund of Spirits that sets Vapours
and Spleen at Defiance.

This Speech bringing on a Comparison between
the Ladies, the Champions for each grew
so warm in the Dispute, that they had like to
have quarrell'd. However, by the Interposition

of some other Gentlemen who were with them,
they parted tolerable Friends that Night, and
renew'd their Visits to Sir Charles in the Morning.


They found only Miss Glanville with her
Father and Brother. arabella generally spent
the Mornings in her own Chamber, where
Reading and the Labours of the Toilet employed
her Time till Dinner: Tho' it must be
confessed to her Honour, that the latter engross'd
but a very small Part of it.

Miss Glanville, with whom the Beau had a
long Conversation at one of the Windows;
in which he recounted his Dispute with Mr.
Selvin, and the Danger he ran of being pink'd
in a Duel, that was his Phrase, for her Sake,
at last propos'd a Walk; to which (he consented,
and engag'd to prevail upon Arabella to
accompany them.

That Lady at first positively refus'd ; alleging
in Excuse, That she was so extremely
interested in the Fate of the Princess Meliintha,
whose Story she was reading, that she could not
stir till she had finished it.

That poor Princess, continu'd the, is at present
in a most terrible Situation. She has just
set Fire to the Palace, in order to avoid the
Embraces of a King who forc'd her to marry
him. I am in Pain to know how she escapes
the Flames.

Pshaw, interrupted Miss Glanville, let her
perish there, if the will; Don't let her hinder
our Walk.

Who is it you doom with so much Cruelty
to perish, said Arabella, closing the Book, and

looking stedfastly on her Cousin ? Is it the beautiful
Melifinta, that Princely, whose Fortitude
and Patience have justly render'd her the Admiration
of the whole World ? That Princess,
descended from a Race of Heroes, whose heroick
Virtues all glow'd in her own beauteous
Breast; that Princess, who, wien taken Captive
with the King her Father, bore her imprisonment
and Chains with a marvellous constancy;
and who, when she enslaved her Conqueror,
and given Fetters to the Prince who
held her Father and herself in Bonds, nobly
iefius'd the Diadem he proffer'd her, and devoted
licifelf to Delusion, in order to punish the
enemy of her iloulf. I am.not able to relate
the reit of her History, fering 1 have read no
further myself ; but if you will be pleated to
lit down and ]ilten to me while I read what remains,
I am persuaded you will find new Cause
to love and admire this amiable Princess.

Pardon me, Madam, said Mils Glanville:, I
have heard enough.; and I could have been
cry well fatisiy'd not to have heard so much.
I think we waste a great deal of Time talking
about People we know nothing of. The Morning
will be quite lost, if we don't make Haste.
Come, added she, you must go: You have a
new Lover below, who waits to go with us;
he'll die if I don't bring you.

A new Lover ! return'd Arabella, surprized.
Aye, aye, said Miss Glanville, the learned
Mr. Selvin; I assure you, he had almost quarrell'd
with Mr.' Tinsel last Night about your
Ladyship.

Arabella, at this Intelligence, casting down.
her Eyes, discovered many Signs of Anger and
Confusion: And after a Silence of some Moments,
during which, Miss Glanville had been
crploy'd in adjusting her Dress at the Glass,
addressing herself to her Cousin with an Accent
somewhat less sweet than before.

Had any other than yourself, Miss, said she,
acquainted me with the Presumption of that
unfortunate Person, I should haply have discovered
my Resentment in other Terms: But, as
its, muss inform you, that I take it extremely
ill, you should be accessary to giving me this
Offence.

Hey day ! said Miss Glanville, turning about
hastily, How have I offended your Ladyship,
pray ?

I am willing to hope, Cousin, reply'd ,Arablla,
that it was only to divert yourself with
the Trouble and Confusion in which you see
me, that you have indiscreetly told Things
which ought to have been bury'd in Silence.

And what is all this mighty Trouble and
Confusion about then, Madam, said Miss
imlnviile, shrilling ? Is it because I told you,
Mr. Selvin was a Lover of your Ladythip ?

Certainly, said Arabella, such an Information
is sufficient to give one a great deal of Perplexity.
Is it such a little Matter, think you, to
be told that a Man has the Presumption to love
one ?

A meer Trifle, reply'd Miss Glanville, laughing;
a hundred Lovers are not worth a Moment's
Thought, when one's sure of them, for
then the Trouble is all over. And .s for this

unfortunate Person, as your Ladyship called
him, let him die at his Leisure, while we goto
the Parade.

Your Levity, Cousin, said Arabella, forces
me to smile, notwithstanding the Cause I have
to be incens'd; however, I have Charity enough
to make me not desire the Death of Mr. Selvin,
who may repair the Crime he has been guilty
of by Repentance and Discontinuation.

Well then, said Miss Glanville, you are resolved
to go to the Parade: Shall I reach you
your odd Kind of Capuchin ?

How, said Arabella, can I with any Propriety
see a Man who has discovered himself to
have a Passion for me ? Will he not construe
such a ]favour into a Permission for him to
hope ?

Oh ! no, interrupted Miss Glanvi le, he does
not imagine I have told your Ladyship he loves
you; for indeed he don't know that I am acquainted
with his Passion.

Then he is less culpable than I thought him,
rcply'd Arabella; and if you think I am in no
Danger of hearing a Confession of his Fault
from his own Mouth, I'll comply with your
Request, and go with you to the Parade. But
added file, I must first engage you to promise
not to leave me alone a Moment, lest he should
take Advantage of such an Opportunity, to
give some Hint of his Pafion, that would force
me to treat him very rigorously.

Miss Glanville answered laughing, That she
would be sure to mind her Directions. However,
said she, your Ladyship need not be apprehensive
he will lay any fine Things to you;

for I knew a young Lady he was formerly in
Love with, and the odious Creature visited hera
Twelve-month before he found Courage
enough to tell her she was handsome.

Doubtless, reply'd Arabella, he was much
to be commended for his Respect. A Lover
should never have the Presumption to declare
his Passion to his Mistress, unless in certain
Circumfiances, which may at the same Time
in part disarm her Anger. For Instance, he
muff struggle with the Violence of his Paoli n,
till it has calf him into a Fever. His Physicians
mus give him over, pronouncing his distemper
incurable, since the Cause of it being
in his Mind, all their Art is incapable of removing
it. Thus he muss sussex, rejoicing at
the Approach of Death, which will free him
from all his Torments, without violating the
Respect he owes to the Divine Object of his
Flame. At length, when he has but a few
Hours to live, his Mifirefs, with many Signs
of Compassion, conjures him to tell her the
Cause of his Despair. The Lover, conscious
of his Crime, evades all her Inquiries; but the
Lady laying at last a peremptory Command
upon him to disclose the Secret, he dares not
disobey her, and acknowledges his Passion with
the utmost Contrition for having offended her
bidding her take the small Remainder of his
Life to expiate his Crime; and finishes his
Discourse by falling into a Swoon.

The Lady is touch'd at his Condition, commands
him to live, and if necessary, permits
him to hope.

VOL. II I This

This is the most common Way in which
such Declarations are, and ought to be brought
about. However, there are others, which areas
well calculated for sparing a Lady's Confusion,
and deprecating her Wrath.

The Lover, for Example, like the Prince
of the iAMa/jageis, after having buried his Passion
in Silence for many Years, may chance to
he walking with his Confidant in a retir'd
Place; to whom, with a Deluge of Tears, the
relates the Excess of his PAssion and Despair.
And while he is thus unbosoming his Griefs,
not in the least suspecting he is overheard, his
Princess, who had been lifting to him in muck
Trouble and Confusion, by some little Rustling
she makes, unawares discovers herself.

The surprized Lover throws himself at her
Feet, begs Pardon for his Rashness, observes
that he had never presumed to discover his
Passion to her; and implores her Leave to die
before her, as a Punishment for his undesigned
Offence.

The Method which the great Armaments took
to let the Princess of Media know he adored
her, was not less respectful. This valiant Prince,
who had long loved her, being to fight a great
Battle, in which he had some secret Presages hc
should fall, which however deceiv'd him, wrote
a long Letter to the divine Mandana, wherein
he discovered his Passion, and the Resolution his
Rcpc&a had inspired him with, to consume in
Silence, and never presume to disclose his Love
while he lived ; acquainting her, that he had
ordered that Letter not to be deliver'd to her,
till it was certainly known that he was dead.

Accordingly he receiv'd several Wounds in
the Sight, which brought him to the Ground,
and his Body not being found, they concluded
it was in the Enemy's Poflffiu

His faithful'Squire, who had receiv'd his intrusions
before'the Battle, hastens to the Princess,
who, with all the Court, is mightily assisted
at his Death.

He presents her the Letter, which she makes
no Scruple to receive, since the Writer is no
more. She reads it, and her whole Soul is
melted with Compassion ; she bewails his Fate
with the most tender and affectionate Marks of
Grief.

Her Confidant asks why fne is so much affected,
since in all Probability, the would not
have pardon'd him for loving her, had he been
alive ?

She acknowledges the Truth of her Observation,
takes Notice that his Death having cancelled
his Crime, his respectful Passion alone
employs her Thoughts; she is relblv'd to bewail
as innocent and worthy of Compassion
when dead, whom living the would treat as a
Criminal, and insinuates, that her Heart had
entertain'd an.Aftcaion for him.

Her Confidant treasures up this Hint, and
endeavours to console her, but in vain, till News
is brought, that Armaments, who had been carry'd
for dead out of the Field, and by a very
surprizing Adventure concealed all this Till,
is returned.

The Princess is cover'd with Confusion, and
tho' glad he is alive, resolves to banish him for
his Crime.

I 2 1-Her

Her Confidant pleads his Caufc so well, that
flie consents to see him ; and, since he can no
longer conceal his Passion, he confirms the Con-session
in his Letter, humbly begging Pardon
for being frill alive.

The Princess, who cannot plead Ignorance
of his Passion, nor deny the Sorrow she tcftify'd
for his Death, condescends to pardon him, and
he is also permitted to hope. In like Manner
the great Prince of Persia-does

your Ladyship consider how late it is,
interrupted Miss Glanville, who had hitherto
very impatiently listen'd to her ? Don't let us
keep the Gentlemen waiting any longer for us.

I must inform you how the Prince of Permit
declar'd his Love for the incomparable Terence,
Laid. Arabella.

Another Time, dear Cousin, said Miss
Glanville; methinks we have talk'd longenough
upon this Subject.

I am sorry the Time has formed so tedious to
you, said Arabella, smiling ; .nd therefore I'll
trespass no longer upon your Patience. Then
ordering Lucy to bring her Hat and Gloves, file
went down Stairs, follow'd by Miss Glanville,
who was greatly disappointed at her not putting
on her Veil.

Mr. Selvin, with mole Gaiety than ufa',
advanc'd towards arabella, who put on so cold
and severe a Countenance at his Approach, that
the poor Man, cxtrcamly confus'd, drew back,
and remain'd in great Perplexity, fearing he had
offended her.

Mr. 7'itl, seeing Mr. Slvin,'s Reception,
and aw'd by the becoming Majesty in her Person,
notwithstanding all his Assurance, accosted
her with less Confidence than was his Cuifom;
but Arabella softning her Looks with the molt
engaging Smiles, made an Apology for detaining
them so long from the Parade, gave her
Hand to the bau, as being not a fufi):tded
Person, and permitted him to lead her out.
Mr. Glanville, to whom she always allow'd the
Preference on those Occasions, being a little indisposed,
and not able to attend her.

Mr. tinsel, whose Vanity was greatly flatter'd
by the Preference Arabella gave him to
his Companion, proceeded according to his
usual Custom, to examine her Looks ani Behaviour
with more Care; conceiving such a
Preference must proceed from a latent Motive
which was not unfavourable for him. His
Discernment on these Occasions being very furs

3 priming

prising, he soon discovered in the bright Eyes of
,rablcla a licet Approbation of his Person,
which he endeavoured to increase by displaying
it with all the Address he was Master of, and
die not fail to talk her into an Opinion of his
Wit, by ridiculing every Body that pass'd them,
and directing several study'd Compliments to
herself.

Miss Glanville, who was not so agreeably entertain'd
by the grave Mr. Selvin, saw these
Advances to a Gallantry with her Cousin with
great Disturbance: She was resolved to interrupt
it if possible, and being convinc'd
Mr. Srlvin preferr'd Arabella's Conversation to
hers, she plotted how to pair them together,
and have the Beau to herself.

As they walk'd a few Paces behind her Cousin
and Mr. 1Tiife, the was in no Danger of being
over-heard; and taking Occasion to put
Mr. Selvin in mind of Arabella's Behaviour to
him, when Le accosted her; she ask'd him, if
he was conscious of having done any thing to
offend her?

Protest, Madam, reply'd Mr. Selvin, I know
not of any thing I have done to displease her.
I never fail'd, to my Knowledge, in my Respects
towards her Ladyship, for whom indeed
I have a most profound Veneration.

I know so much of her Temper, resumed
Miss Glanville, as to be certain, if (he has taken
it into har Head to be angry with you, she will
be ten times more so at your Indifference : And
if you hope for her Favour, you must ask her
Pardon with the most earnest Submission imaginable.


If I knew I had offended her, repi'J
Mr. Selvin, I would very willingly ask her Pardon;
but really, since I have not been guilty
of any Fault towards her Ladyship, I don't
know how to acknowledge it.

Well, said Mils Glanville coldly, I only
took the Liberty to give you some friendly Advice,
which you may follow, or nut, as you
please. I know my Cousin is angry at something,
and I wish you were Friends again,
that's all.

I am mightily oblig'd to you, Madam, aid
Mr. Selvin; and since you assure me her Ladyship
is angry, I'll ask her Pardon, tho', really,
as I said before, I don't know for what.

Well, interrupted Miss Glanville, we'll join
them at the End of the Parade ; and to give
you an Opportunity of speaking to my Coffin,
I'll engage Mr. Tinsel myself.

Mr. Selvin, who thought himself greatly
oblig'd to Miss Glanville for her good Intentions,
tho' in reality she had a View of exposing of
her Cousin, as well as an Inclination to engage
Mr. tinsel, took Courage as they turn'd, to gtt
on the other Side of Arabella, whom he had not
dar'd before to approach, while Miss Glanville,
addressing a Whisper of no great Importance to
her Cousin, parted her from the Beau, and
slackening her Pace a little, fell into a particular
Discourse with him, which arabella being too
polite to interrupt, remain'd in a very perplexing
Situation, dreading every Moment that
Mr. Selvin would explain himself. Alarm'd at
his Silence, yet resolv'd to interrupt him if he
began to speak, and afraid of beginning a Coni

variation sires, lest he should construe it to his
Advantage.

Mr. Selvin being naturally timid in the Company
of Ladies, the Circumstance of Disgrace
which he was in with Arabella, her Silence and
Reserve so added to his accustomed Diffidence,
that tho' he endeavour' several times to speak,
he was not able to bring out any thing but a
preluding Hem ; which he observed, to his extreme
Confusion, seemed always to increase
Arabella's Constraint.

Indeed, that Lady, upon any Suspicion that
he was going to break his mysterious Silence,
always contract her Brow into a Frown, cast
down her Eyes with an Air of Perplexity, endeavour'd
to hide her Blushes with her Fan ;
and to slew her In attention, directed her Looks
to the contrary Side.

The Lady and Gentleman being in equal
Confusion, no Advances were made on either
Side towards a Conversation, and they had
reach'd almost the End of the Parade in an uninterrupted
Silence; when Mr. Selvin, fearing he
should never again have so good an Opportunity
of making lis Peace, collected all his Resolution,
and with an Accent trembling under
the Importance of the Speech he was going to
make, began,

Madam, Since I have had the Honour of
walking with your Ladyship, I have observed
so many Signs of Confiraint in your Manner,
that I hardly dare intreat you to grant me a
Moment's Hearing while I-

Sir, interrupted Arabella, before you go any
further, I must inform you, that what you are

going to say will mortally offend me. Take
heed then how you commit an Indiscretion
which will force me to treat you very rigorously.

If your Ladyship will not allow me to speak
in my own Justification, said Mr. Se/v:n, yet I
hope you will not refute to tell me my Offence,
once I

You are very confident, indeed, interrupted
Arabella again, to suppose I will repeat what
would be infinitely grievous for me to lea;.
Against my Will, pursued fhc, I mull give Sei
the Satisfaction to know, that I am not ignorant
of your Crime, but I also assure you that I
am highly incens'd; and that, not only with the
Thoughts you have dar'd to entertain of me,
but likewise with your Presumption in going
about to disclose them.

Mr. Selvii,.whom the seeming Contractions
in this Speech astonished, yet imagin'd in general
it hinted at the Dispute between him and
Mr. tinsel; and supposing the Story had been
told to his Disadvantage, which was the Caufc
of her Anger,. reply in great Emotion at the
Injustice done him.

Since somebody has been so officious to acquaint
your Ladyship with an Affair which
ought to have ben kept from ,your Knowledge;
'tis a Pity they did not inform you, that
Mr. Tinsel was the Person that had the least
Refp:& for your Ladyship, and is more worthy
of your Resentment

If Mr. Tinsel, replied Arabella, is guilty ossian
Offence like yours, yet since he has concealed
it better, he is ltks culpable than you ;
and you have don; that for him, which hap)

he would never have had Courage enough to do
sr himself as long as he lived,

Poor Soli, quite confounded at these intricate
Words, would have begged her to explain
herself, had flie not silenced him with a dreadful
Frown . And making a Flop till Miss Glanville
and Mr. 'tinsel came up to them. She told her
Couitn with a peevish Accent, that she hal
?performed her Promise very ill; and whisper'd
ser, that she was to blame for all the Mortifications
She had fused.

Mr, Tinsel, supposing the Alteration in
.,lrakeia's Humour proceeded from being so long
diepr\!d of his Company ; endeavour'd to make
her Amends by a Profusion of Compliments,
vIiich she receiv'd with such an Air of Displeasure,
that the Beau, vex'd at the ill Success of
!its Gallantry, told her, he was afraid Mr. 's
Gravity had-sheeted her Ladyship.
Say rather, reply'd arabella, that his Indiscretion
has offended me.

Mr. Tinsel, charm'd with this beginning confidence,
which confirm'd his Hopes of having
made fie Impression on her Heart; conjur'd
her very earnestly to tell him how Mr. Servir,
had offended her.

'Tis sufficient, resumed she, that E tell you.
he has offended me, without declaring the Nature
of his Chime, since doubtless it has not
escaped your Observation, which, if I may
believe him, is not wholly disinterested. To
confess yet more, 'tis true that he hath told me
something concerning you, which -

Let me perish Madam, interrupted the
Beau, if one Syllable be has said be true.

How, sail rat idea) a little disconcerted,
Will you always persist in a Denial then ?

Deny it, Madam, returned Mr. 'Tinsel, I'll
deny what hc has said with my last Breath; 'tis
all a scandalous Forgery: No Man raving is less
likely to think of your Ladyship in that Manner.
If you knew my Thoughts, Madam,
you would be convinc'd nothing is more impossible,
and-sir,

interrupted Arabella, extremely mortify'd,
methinks you are very eager in your Ratification.
I promise you, I do not think you
guilty of the Offence he charg'd you with; it
Did, you would haply experience my Resentment
in such a Manner, as would make you
repent of your Presumption.

Arabella, in finishing there Words, interrupted
Miss Glanville's Discourse with Mr.Sdvi',
to tell her, she defined to return Home ; to
which that young Lady, who had not been at
all pleas'd with the Morning's Walk, consented.

In which our Heroine reconciles herj/el to

Adventure in a Romances, alar. to her

soon as the Ladies were come to their:

Apartment to meditate upon what had pass'd,
and. Miss Glanville retir'd to dress for Dinner;

while the two Gentlemen, who thought they
had great Reason to be dissatisfied with each
other on Account of Lady Bella's Behaviour,
went to a Coffeehouse, in order to come to
Ime Explanation about it,

Air, I am greatly obliged to you fer the Endeavours
you have us'd to ruin me in Lady Bet'bs.
Opinion. Rat me, if it is not the greater
Misfortune in the World, to give occasion for
Envy.

Envy, Sir, interrupted tMr. Selvin; I protest
I do really adliiire your great Skill in Stratagems,
but I do not envy you the Possession of
it. You have, indeed, very wittily contrived
to put your own Sentiments of that Lady,
which you delivered so freely the other Night,.
into my Mouth. 'Twas a After-piece of
Cunning, indeed; and, as I said before, I admire
your Fill prodigiously.

I don't know whatyou mean, reply'd 7infl/,
y u talk in Riddles. Did you not yourself acquaint
Lady Bella with the Preference gave
Miss Glalnvilk to her ? What would you propose
by filch Piece of Treachery ? You have
ruin'd all my Hopes by it: The Lady resents
it excessively, and it's no Wonder, 'faith, it
niuft certainly mortify her. Upon my Soul, I
can never forgive thee for so mal a propos a
Discovery,

Forgive me, Sir, replied Calvin, in a Rage,
I don't want your Forgiveness. I have done
nothing unbecoming a Man of Honour. The
Lady was so prejudiced by your Insinuation,
that the would not give we Leave to speak;,

otherwise, I would have fully inform'd her of
her Mirage, that (he might have known how
much she was oblig'd to you.

So (he would not hear thee, interrupted Tinsel
laughing, dear Soul, how very kind was that ?
'faith, I don't know how it is, but I am very
lucky, without deserving to be so. Thou art
a Witness for me, Frank, I took no great Pains
to gain this fine Creature's Heart; but it was
damn'd malicious tho', to attempt to make
Discoveries. I see the is a little piqu'd, but
I'll set all to rights again with a Billet-doux. I've
an excellent Hand, tho' I say it, at a Billet-doux.
I never knew one of mine fail in my Life.

Harry, Sir, said Selvin whispering, anymore
Attempts to lift your Sentiments upon
me, and you shall hear of it. In the mean
Time, be assured, I'll clear myself, and put the
Saddle upon the right Horse.

Femme, if thou art not queer Fellow,
said Tinsel, endeavouring to hide his Discomposure
at this Threat under a forc'd Laugh.

Selvin, without making any Reply, retir'd
to write to Arabella ; ,which Tinsel suspecting,
resolv'd to be befqogiand with him; and without
leaving the Coffee-house, call'd for Paper,.
and wrote a Bullet to her, which he dispatched.
away immediately.

The Messenger had just got Admittance to
Lucy, when another arriv'd from Seven.

They both presented their Letters, but Lucy.
refus'd them, saying, her Lady would turn her
away, if she receiv'd such Sort of Letters.

Such Sort of Letters, return'd Tinsel's Man !
Why, do you know what they contain, then?

To be sure, I do, reply'd Lucy ; they are
Love-Letters; and my Lady has charg'd me
never to receive any more

Well, reply'd Selvin's Servant, you may take
my Letter; for my Master desired me to tell
you, it was about Business of Consequence,
which your Lady must be acquainted with.

Since you assure me it is not a Love-letter,
I'll take it, said Lucy.

And, pray take mine too, said Tinfcl's merry
; for I assure you, it is not a Love-letter
neither ; it's only a Billet-doux.

Are you sure of that, reply'd Lucy ; because
I may venture to take it, I fancy, if its what
you say.

I'll swear it, said the Man delivering it to
her. Well, said she, receiving it, I'll take
them both up. But what did you call this,
pursued she ? I must not forget it, or else my
Lady will think it a Love-letter.

A Billet-doux, said the Man.
Lucy, for fear the should forget it, repeated
the Words Billet-doux several Times as she went
up Stairs; but entering her Lady's Apartment,.
the perceiving the Letters in her Hand, ask'd
her so sternly, how she durst presume to bring
them into her Presence, that the poor Girl, in
her Fright, forgot the Lesson she had been conning;
and endeavouring to recal it into her
Memory, took no Notice of her Lady's question,
which 'he repeated several times, but to
no Purpose.

Arabella, surprized at her in-attention, reiterated
her Commands, in a Tone somewhat

louder than usual; asking her at the same Time,
why she did not obey her immediately ?

Indeed, Madam, reply'd Lucy, your Ladyship
would not order me to take back the Letters,
if you knew what they were : They are
not Love-Letters; I was resolv'd to be sure of
that before I took them. This, Madam, is a
Letter about Business of Consequence; and the
other - Oh dear ! I can't think what the
Man call'd it ! But it is not a Love-letter, indeed,
Madam.

You are a simple Wench, said Arabella
smiling: You may depend upon it, all Letters
directed to me, must contain Matters of Love
and Gallantry; and those I am not permitted
to receive. Take them away then immediately.
But ray, pursued she, seeing she was about to
obey her, one of them, you say, was deliver'd
to you as a Letter of Consequence ; perhaps ia
is o : Indeed it may contain an Advertisement
of some Design to carry me away. How do i
know, but Mr. Melvin, incited by his Love and
Despair, may intend to make such an Attempt.
Give me that Letter, Lucy, I am resolved to
open it. As for the other yet who knows
but the other may also bring me Warning of
the same Danger from another Quarter. The
Pains Mr. Tinfcl took to conceal his Passion,
nay, almost as I think, to deny it, amounts to
a Proof that he is meditating same Way to
make sure of me. 'Tis certainly o : Give me
that Letter, Lucy; I should be accessary to
their intended Violence, if I neglected this
timely Discovery,

lyell, cried she, taking one of the Letters,
this is exactly like what happen'd to the beautiful
Princess of Cappadocia; who, like me, in
one and the same Day, receiv'd Advice that
two of her Lovers intended to carry her of';

As she pronounced these Words Miss Glanville
enter'd the Room, to whom Arabella immediately
recounted the Adventure of the Letters;
telling her, the did not doubt, but they contain'd
a Discovery of some Conspiracy to carry her
away.

And whom does your Ladyship fufpea of such
a strange Design, pray, said Miss Glanville
smiling ?

At present, reply'd arabella,. the two Cavaliers
who walk'd with us to Day, are the Persons
who seem the moi likely to attempt that
Violence.

I dare answer for Mr. Tinsel, replied Mils
Glanville, he thinks of no fitch Thing.

Well, said Arabella, to convince you of your
Mistake, I muss inform you, that Mr. Se/vin,
having the Presumption to begin a Declaration
of Love to me on the Parade this Morning, I
reprov'd him severely for his Want of Refute,.
and threatened him with my Displeasure; in the
Rage of his Jealousy, at seeing me treat
Mr. tinsel well, he discovered to me, that he
also was as criminal as himself, in order to
oblige me to a severer Usage of him.

So he told you Mr. Tinsel was in Love with
you, interrupted Miss Glanville ?

He told it me in other words, reply'd Arabella;
for he said, Mr. 'tinsel was guilty of that skene,
which I resent so severely to him.

Miss Glanville beginning to comprehend the
Mystery, with great Difficulty forbore laughing
at her Cousin's Mistake; for the well knew
the Offence Mr. Savin hinted at, and desirous
of knowing what those Letters contained, (he
begg'd her to delay opening them no longer.

Arabella, pleas'd at her Solicitude, open'd
one of the Letters; but glancing her Eye to
the Bottom, and seeing the Name of Selvin,
she threw it hastily upon the Table, and averting
her Eyes, What a Mortification have I
avoided, said she, that Letter is from Sevin ;
and questionless, contains an Avowal of his
Crime.

Nay, you muss read it, cried Miss Glanville,
taking it up; since you have open'd it, its the
same Thing: You can never persuade him but
you have seen it. However, to spare your
Nicety, I'll read it to you. Which accordingly
she did, and found it as follows.

T Know not what Insinuations have beens"
1 made use of to persuade you I was guilty
"of the Offence, which, with Justice, occasioned
your Resentment this Morning ; but

I assure you, nothing was ever more false.
My Thoughts of your Ladythip are very

different, and full of the profoundest respect
and Veneration. I have Reason to
suspect Mr. T'ifel is the Person who has thus
"endeavoured to prejudice me with your Ladyship
; therefore I am excusable if I tell
"you, that those very Sentiments, too disrespectful
to be named, which he would persuade

you are mine, he discovered hiinmff.
"He then, Madam, is the Person guilty cf
that Offence he so falsly lays to the Charge
f him, who is, with the utinoft Respect an
Esteem,

How's this, cry'd Miss Glanville ? Why,
Madam, you are certainly mistaken. You see
Mr. Selvin utterly denies the Crime of loving
you. He has suffered very innocently in your
Opinion. Indeed, your Ladyship was too hasty
in condemning him.

If what he says be true, replied Arabella,
who had been in extream Confusion, while a
Letter so different from what she expected was
reading; I have indeed unjustly condemn'd
him. Nevertheless, I am fill inclin'd to believe
this is all Artifice ; and that he is really
guilty of entertaining a Passion for me.

But why should he take so much Pains to
deny it, Madam, said MifsGlarville ? Methinks
that looks very odd.

Not at all, interrupted Arabella, whose Spirits
were rais'd by recollecting an Adventure in
her Romance, similar to this. Mr. Selvin has
fallen upon the very same Stratagem with Sera-menes;
who being in Love with the beautiful
Cleobuline, Princess of Corinth, took unimaginable
Pains to conceal his Passion, in order

to be near that fair Princess; who would have
banished him from her Presence, had the known
he was in Love with her. Nay, he went sofar
in his Dissimulation, as to pretend Love to
one of the Ladies of her Court ; that his Passion
for the Princess might be the lets taken notice
of. In these Cases therefore, the more [e-
politely a Man denies his Passion, the more
pure and violent it is.

Then Mr. Selvin's Passion is certainly very
violent, reply'd Miss Glanville, for he denies it
very resolutely; and I believe none but your
Ladyship would have discovered his Artifice.
But shall we not open the other Letter? I have
a firing Notion it comes from Tinsel.

For that very Reason I would not be acquainted
with the Contents, reply'd Arabella,
You see, Mr. Selvin accuses him of being guilty
of that Offence which he denies: I shall doubtless,
meet with a Confirmation of his Love in
that Letter. Do not, I beseech you added
the, seeing her Cousin preparing to open the
Letter, expose me to the Pain of hearing a presumptuous
Declaration of Love. Nay, pursued
she, rising in great Emotion, if you are
resolved to persecute me by reading it, I'll endeavour
to get out of the hearing of it.

You shan't, I declare, raid Miss Glanville,
laughing and holding her, I'll oblige you to
hear it.

I vow, Cousin, said Arabella smiling, you
use me just as the Princess Cleopatra did the fair
and wire Antonio. However, if by this you
mean to do any Kindness to the unfortunate
Person who wrote that Billet, you are greatly

mistaken; since, if you oblige me to listen to
a Declaration of his Crime, you will lay me
under a Necessity to banish him. A Sentence
he would have avoided, while I remained ignorant
of it.

To this Miss Glanville made no other Reply
than by opening the Billet, the Contents of
which may be found in the following Chapter.

C HAP. XIII.
In which our Heroin's Extravagance will

be thought, perhaps, to be carried to an
extravagant Length.
MADAM,
I Had the Honour to assure you this Morning
on the Parade, that the Insinuations
"Mr. Selvin made use of to rob me of the
superlative Happiness of your Esteem were
entirely false and groundless. May the Beams
of your bright Eyes never shine on me more,
if there is any Truth in what he said to prejudice
me with your Ladyship. If I am
permitted to attend you to the Rooms this
Evening, I hope to convince you, that it

was absolutely impossible I could have been
"capable of such a Crime, who am, with the
most profound Respect,

Well, Madam, said Miss Glanville when
she had read this Epistle, I fancy you need not
pronounce a Sentence of Banishment upon poor
Mr. Tinsel; he seems to be quite innocent of
the Offence your Ladyship suspects him of.
Why, really, return'd iranb:ll, hushing
with extreme Confusion at this second Disappointment,
I am greatly perplex'd to know
how I ought to aA on this Occasion. I am
much in the same Situation with the Princess
Serena. For you must know, this Princess -
Here Lucy entering, inform'd the Ladies Dinner
was serv'd I hall defer till another Opportunity,
said ArabElla, upon this Interruption,
the Relation of the Princess Serena's Adventures;
which you will find, added (he, in a low
Voice, bears a very great ResemblAnce to mine.
Miss Glanville rcp!y'd, file would hear it
whenever (he pleas'd, and then follow'd Aral'cl
to the Dining Room.

The Cloth was scarce remov'd, when
Mr. Selvin came in. Arabella blushed at ibis
Appearance, and discovered so much Perplexity
in her Behaviour, that Mr. Selvin was apprehensive
he had not yet sufficiently justified himself;
and therefore took the first Opportunity
to approach her.

I (hall think myself very unhappy, Madam,
said he bowing, if the Letter I did myself the
Honour to write to you this Morning

Sir, interrupted Arabella, I perceive you are
going to forget the Contents of that Letter,
and preparing again to offend me by a presumptuous
Declaration of Love.

Who I, Madam, reply'd he, in great Astonishment
and Confusion, I-I-I protest-tho'
I-I have a very great Refpet for your Lady.
(hip, yet-yet I never presumed

have presumed too much, replied Arabella,
and I should forget what I ow'd to my
own Glory, if I furnished you with any mole
Occasions of offending me. - Know then, I
absolutely forbid you to appear before me again,
at least, till I am convinc'd you have chang'd
your Sentiments.

Saying this, file rose from her Seat, and
making a Sign to him not to follow her, which
indeed he had no Intention to do, fe quitted
the Room, highly satisfied with her own conduce
upon this Occasion, which was cxaic!y
conformable to the Laws of Romance.

Mr. Tinsel, who had just alighted from his
Chair, having a Glimpse of her, as Ihe passed
to her own Apartment, resolv'd, if possible, to
procure a private Interview; for be did not
doubt but his Billet had done Wonders in his
Favour.

For that Purpose he ventur'd up to her Antechamber,
where he found Lucy in waiting',
whom he desired to acquaint her Lady, that hie
intreated a Moment's Speech with her.

Lucy, after hesitating a Moment, and looking
earnestly at him, replied, Sir, if you'll
promise mi faithfully, you are not in Love
with my Lady, I'll go and deliver your Message.


Duce take me, said Tinsel, if that is not a
very whimsical Condition truly Pray, my
Dear, how came it into thy little Brain, to

'used J was in Love with thy Lady ? But,
suppose I Should be in Love with her, what
then ?

Why, then its likely you would die, that's
all, said Lucy, without my Lady would be so
kind to command you to live.

I vow thou hast mighty pretty Notions, Child,
said Tinsel failing; hall thou been reading
any Play-Book lately ? But pray, doit think
thy Lady would have Compassion on me, if I
was in Love with her ? Come, I know thou
art in her Confidence ? Hast thou ever heard
her talk of me ? Does Lie not tell thee all her
Secrets ?

Here dlrablhila's Bell ringing, the Beau slipped
half a Guinea into her Hand, which Lucy not
willing to refute, went immediately to her
Lady ; to whom, with a trembling Accent,
she repeated Mr. Tinfcl's Request.

Imprudent Girl, cried Arabella, for I am
loth to suspect thee of Disloyalty to thy Mistress.
Dost thou know the Nature and Extent of the
Request thou hall deliver'd ? Art thou ignorant
that the presumptuous Man whom thou solicited
this Favour for, has mortally defended me ?
Indeed, Madam, said Lucy frighted out of
hermits, I don't sollicit for him. I scorn to do
any such Thing. I would not offend your
Ladyship for the World: For, before I would
deliver his Menage to your Ladyflip, I made
him allure me, that he was not in Love with
your Ladyship.

That was very wisely done, indeed, replied
Arabella, smiling: And do you believe he spoke
the Truth

Yes, indeed, I am fare of it, said Lucy
eagerly, if your Ladyship will but be pleas'd to
see him, he is only in the next Room; I dare
promise

How, interrupted Arabella ! What have you
done ? Have you brought him into my Apartment
then.? I protest this Adventure is exactly
like what beset the beautiful Statira, when, by
stratagem of the flame Kind, Oroondates was
introduc'd into her Presence. Lucy, thou art
another Barking, I think ; but I hope thy Intentions
are not less innocent than hers was.

Indeed, Madam, rcply'd Lucy, excessively
uneasy at her Lady's Words, I am very innocents
I am no Bathing, as your Ladyflip calls
me.

I dare answer for thee, said isabella smiling
at the Turn she gave to her Words, thou art
Bo Baiting ; and I should wrong thee very
much to compare thee with that wise Princess;
for thou art certainly one of the moor simple
Wenches in the World. But since thou halt
gone so far, let me know what the unfortunate
Person desires of me; for, since I am neither
more rigid, nor pretend to more Virtue than
Statira, I may do at least as much for him, as
that great Queen did for Oroondlates.

He desires, Madam, said Lucy, that your
Ladyship would be pleas'd to let him speak with
you.

Or, in his Words, I suppose, replied Arabella,
he humbly implor'd a Moment's Audience.

I told your Ladyship his very Words, indeed,
Madam, said Luy.

I tell thee, Girl, thou art mistaken, said
Arabella ; 'tis impossible he should sue for such
a Favour in Terms like those : Therefore, go
back, and let him know that I consent grant
him a (short Audience upon these Conditions.

First, Provided he does not abuse my Indulgence
by offending me with any Protestations
of his Passion.

Secondly, That he engages to fulfil the Injunctions
I (hall lay upon him, however cruel
and terrible they may appear.

Lastly, That his Despair muff not prompt
him to any At of Desperation against himself.

Lucy having received this Message, quitted
the Room hastily, for fear (he (hould forget it.

Well, my pretty Ambassadress, said T:i;el
when he saw her enter the Antechamber,
Will your Lady see me ?

No, Sir, replied Lucy.
No, interrupted Tinsel, that's kind 'faith,
after waiting so long.

Pray Sir, said Lucy, don't put me out so; I
(hall forget what my Lady ordered me to tes
you.

Oh ! I ask your Pardon, Child, said 7Tntl,.
Come, let me hear your Message.

Sir, said Lucy adapting the Solemnity of her
Lad's Accent-My Lady had me sav, that sewell
grant-No, that she consent to grant you
a short Hence.

Audience you would say Child, said 7'r;,i
But how came you to tell me be,:fr (hee vsi.uid
not see me ?

Vol. II, K I VC

I vow and protest, Sir, said Lucy, you have
put all my Lady's Words clean out of my
Head-1 don't know what comes next-oil,

no matter, said tinsel, you have told
me enough: I'll wait upon her direct.

Lucy, who law him making towards the
Door, press between it and him ; and having
al! her Lady's Whims in her Head, supposed
he was going to carry her away P flcfs'd with
this Thought, (he screamed out, Help ! Help i
for Heaven's Sake ! My Lady wills be carry'd
away!

Arabella hearing this Exclamation of her
Woman's, eccho'd her Screams, tho' with a
Voice infinitely more delicate; and seeing Tinfcl,
who, confounded to the last Degree at the
Cries of both the Lady and her Woman, had
got into her Chamber he knew not how,
(he gave herself over for lost, and fell back in
her Chair in a Swoon, or something she took
for a Swoon, for n(e was persuaded it could
happen no otherwise; since all Ladies in the
same Circumstances carr terrify'd into a fainting
Fit, and seldom recover till they are conveniently
carried away ; and when they awake, find
themselves many Miles off in the Power of
their Ravisher.

Arabella's other Women, alarm'd by her
Cries, came running into the Room; and feeing
Mr. Thief there, and their Lady ia a Swoon,
concluded some very extraordinary Accident
had happen'd.

What is your Business here, cry'd they all at
a Time ? Is it you that has frighted her ladyship
Dew

Devil take me, said Tii/cl amaz'd, if I cartel
what all this means,

By this Time Sir Charles, Mr. Glanville, and
his Sister, came running astonished up Stairs.
Jlrraia slid! continued motionless in her Chair,
her E,'es cls'd, and her Head reclined upon
Lucy, who with her other Women, was endeavouring
to recover her.

Mr. Glanville eagerly ran to her Affiance,
while Sir Charles and his Daughter as eagerly
interrogated Mr. Tins!, who flood inotionllcf
with Surprize, concerning the Cause of her
Disorder.

Arabella, then first discovering orme Signs
of Life, half open'd her Eyes.
Inhuman Wretch, cry'J the, with a faint
Voice, supposing herself in the Hands of her
Ravisher, think not thy cruel Violence shall
procure thee what thy Submissions could not
obtain; and if when thou hadst only my indifference
to surmount, thou didil find it so difficult
to overcome my Resolution, now that by
this unjust Attempt, thou hast added Aversion
to that Indifference, never hope for any Thing
but the in ft bitter Reproaches from me.-

Why, Niece, said Sir Charles approaching
her, what's the Matter ? Look up, I beseech
you, no-body is attempting to do you any Hurt;
hIrc's none but Friends about you.

Arabella, waiting her Head at the Sound of
her Uncle's Voice, and catling a confus'd Look
on the Persons about her,
May I believe my Senses? Am I recurs,
and in my own Chamber ? To whose Valour
is my Deliverance owing? Without

K z doubt,

doubt, 'tis to my Cousin's; but where is he ?
Let me assure him of my Gratitude.

Mr. Glanville', who had retir'd to a Window
in great Confusion, as soon as he heard her call
tor him, came towards her, and in a lviii cr
legged her to be compos'd ; that she was in no
Danger.

And pray, Niece, said Sir Charls, now you
are a little recover'd, be so good to inform us
of the Cause of your Fright. What has happen'd
to occafi n all this Confusion ?

How, Sir, said Arabella, don't you know
then what has happened-pray how was I
brought again into my Chamber, and by what
Meals was I rescued ?

I protest, said Sir Charles, I don't know that
you have been out of it.

Alas, replied isabella, I perceive you are
quite ignorant of what has befallen me ; nor
am I able to give you any Information: All I
can tell you is, that alarm'd by my Womens
Cries, and the Sight of my Ravisher, who
came into my Chamber, I fainted away, and
so facilitated his Enterprize ; since doubtless it
was very easy for him to carry me away while
1 remain'd in that senseless Condition. How I
was rfclu'd, or by whom, one of my Women
can holy inform you ; since its probable one of
them was also forc'd away with me - Oh
Heavens! cry'd flie, seeing Tins, who all this
while flood gazing like one disgraced ; what
makes that impious Man in my Presence !
What am I to think of this? Am I really de-veered
or no ?

What can this mean, cried Sir C tar.c,
turning
to Tinsel ? Have you, Sir, had any Hand
in fighting my Nieces,

Sir, said Tinsel ! Let me perish if ever I
was so confounded in my Life: The Lady's
Brain is disordered I believe.

Mr. Glanville, who was convinc'd all this
Confusion was caus'd by Come of Arabella's
usual Whims, dreaded lest au Explanation wou!l
the more expose her; and therefore told his
Father, that it would be best to retire, and leave
his Cousin to the Care of his Sister and herdsmen;
adding, that she was not yet quite recover'd,
and their Presence did but discompose
her.

Then addressing himself to Tinsel, told him
he would wait upon him down Stairs.

Arabella seeing them going away together,
and supposing they intended to dispute the Profession
of her with their Swords, called out to
them to slay.

Mr. Glanville however, without minding her,
pressed Mr. Tbinel to walk down.

Nay, pray, Sir, said the Beau, let us go in
again; she may grow outrageous if we disoblige
her;

Outrageous, Sir, said Glanville, do you suppose
my Cousin is mad ?

Upon my Soul, Sir, replied Tinsel, if she is
not mad,. (he is certainly a little out of her
Senses, or so

Arabella having reiterated her Commands for
her Lovers to return, and finding they did not
obey her, ran to her Chamber-door, where they
were holding a surly Sort of Conference, tfpe-

K 3 ciallr

ciaily on Glanville's Side, who was horridly out
of Humour.

I perceive by your Looks. said Arabella to
her Cousin, the Design you arc meditating;
but knew that I absolutely forbid you, by all
the Power I have over you, not to engage in
Combat with my Ravisher here.

Madam, interrupted Glanvhii, I beseech you
do not -

I know, said fhc, you will objet to me the
Examples of Armaments, Princes, and many
others, who were so generous as to prom:ilc
their Rivals not to refuse them that Satisfaction
whenever they demanded it-but consider, you
have net the same Obligations to Mr. tinsel that
,Artamnes had to the King of .Ajiria, or that
.forces had to

For God's Sake, Cousin, said Glanville, what's
all this to the Purpose ? Curse on Agonies and
the King of Assyria, I say .

The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate
Speech of her Cousin, kept her for a Moment
immoveable, wheen Sir Charles, who during
this Discourse, had been collecting all the
Information he could from Luy, concerning
this perplex'd Affair, came towards Tinsel, and
giving him an angry Look, told him, He should
take it well if he forbore visiting any of his Family
for the future.

Oh ! Your most obedient Servant, Sir, said
Tinsel: You expect, I suppose, I (hould be excessively
chagrin'd at this Prohibition ? But upon
my Soul, I am greatly obliged to you. Aged!
I have no great Mind to a Halter: And since
this Lady is so apt to think People have a Design

to ravish her, the wisest Thing a Man can dois
to keep out of her Way.

Sir, replied Glanville who had follow'd him
to the Door, I believe there has been sone !little
Mistake in what has happen'd To-days' ,w-
ever, I expect you'll take no unbecoming Liberties
with the Character of Lady J',i':

Oh ! Sir, said Tinbfl, I give you my Honour
I shall always speak of the Lady with the most
profound Veneration. She is a most accomplished,
incomprehensible Ldy : And the Devil
take me, if I think there is her Fellow in
the World And so, Sir, I am your most
obedient

Word with you before you go, said
Glanville flopping him-No more of these Sneers
as you value that smooth Face of yours, or I'll
despoil it of a Nose.

Oh ! Your humble Servant, said the B:.a,
retiring in great Confusion, with something betwixt
a Smile and a Grin upon his Countenance,
which he took Care however Mr. Glanville
(hould not see; who as soon as he quitted him
went again to Arabella's Apartment, in order to
prevail upon his Father and Sister to leave hera
little to herself, for he dreaded lest some more
Instances of her Extravagance would put it into
his Father's Head, that she was really out of
her Senses.

Well, Sir, said Arabella upon his Entrance,
you have I suppose, given your Rival his Liberty.
I assure you this Generosity is highly
agreeable to me And herein you imitate the
noble Armaments, who upon a like Occasion,
acted as you have done. For when Fortune

K . had

had put the Ravisher of Mandana in his Power,
and he became the Vanquisher of his Rival,
who endeavour'd by Violence to possess that divine
Princess; this truly generous Hero relinquished
the Right head of disposing of his Prisoner,
and instead of sacrificing his Life to his
just and reasonable Vengeance, he gave a Proof
of his admirable Virtue and Clemency by dismissing
him in Safety, as you have done. However,
added she, I hope you have made him
swear upon your Sword, that he will never
make a second Attempt upon my Liberty. I
perceive, pursued she, seeing Mr. Glanville continued
silent, with his Eyes bent on the
Ground, for indeed he was ashamed to look up;
that you would willingly avoid the Praise due
to the heroick Action you have just perform'd-nay,
I suppose you are resolv'd to keep it secret
if possible ; yet I must tell you, that you will
not escape the Glory due to it. Glory is as
necessarily the Result of a virtuous Action, as
Light is an Effect of the Sun which casteth it,
and has no Dependence on any other Cause
since a virtuous Sion continues still the same,
tho' it be done-without Testimony; and Glory,
which is, as one may say born with it, constantly
attends it, tho' the Action be notknown.

I protest Niece, said Sir Charles, that's very
prettily laid.

In my Opinion, Sir, pursued Arabella, if
any thing can weaken the Glory of a good:
Action, its the Care a Person takes to make it
known: As if one did not do. Good, for the.
Sake of Good, but for the Praise that generally
follows-it. Those then that are govern'd by

so interested a Motive, ought to be considered
as sordid rather than generous Persons; whisking
a Kind of Traffick between Virtue and
Glory, barter just so much of the one for the
other, and expect like other Merchants, to
make Advantage by the Exchange.

Mr. Glanville, who was charm'd into an Extacy
at this sensible Speech of Arabella's, forgot
in an Instant all her Absurdities. He did not
fail to express his Admiration of her Understanding
in Terms that brought a Blush; butcher
fair Face, and oblig'd her to lay her Commands
upon him to cease his excessive Commendations.
Then making a Sign to them to
leave her alone, Mr. Glanville who understood
her, took his Father and Sister down Stairs,
leaving Arabella with her faithful Luy whom
(he immediately commanded to give lier a Relation
of what had happen'd tr) her from the
Time of her swooning till (he recover'd.

CHA P. XIV.
A Dialogue between Arabella and Lucy,

in which the latter seems to have disadvantages


H Y, Madam, said Lucy, all I 'can tell
your Ladyship is, that we were all excessively
frighted,, to be sure, when you fainted,
especially myself; and that we did what
we could to recover you'd so accordingly'"
your Ladythip did recover.

'K 5 Wh.B

What's this to the Purpose, said arabella,
perceiving she fiop'd here ? I know that I fainted,
and 'tis also very plain that I recover'd
again-I ask you'what happcf 'd to me in'the
intermediate Time between my Fainting ant
Recovery. Give me a faithful Relation of all
the Accidents, to which by my Fainting I am
quite a Stranger; and which no doubt, are very
considerable

Madam, replied Lucy, I have given
your Ladyship a faithful Relation of all I can
remember.

When, resumed Arabella surprized ?- '
This Moment, Madam, said Lucy'.
Why, sure thou dreamt Wench, replied
she, Hast thou told me how I was sized and
carry'd off? How I was rescu'd again ? Anno,

indeed, Madam, interrupted Lucy, I

you was carry'dl off

satisfy my Curiosity ? Is it not fit I should be.
acquainted with such a momentous Part of my
History ?

I can't, indeed, and pkalfe your Ladyship,

- WV.liat, can'st thou not, said-amelia, enrag'd
at her Stupidity, as fil thoughts

Why, Madam, (aid Lucy sobbing, I can't
ir.ake a History of nothing.

Of nothing, Wench, resumed Arabella, ina
greater Rage Bean before: D.:s thou call an
Adventure to which thou was a Witness, and
bereft haply so great a Share in, nothi;i%-An
Adventure which hereafter r will Slake a consist"'
- *.;.'.' durable

durable Figure in the Relation of my Life, dost
thou look upon as trifling and of no Consequence
?

No, indeed I don't, M.idam, said Lucy.
Why then, pursued Arabella, dost thou wi-fully
neglect to relate it ? Suppose, as there is
nothing more likely, thou wert commanded by
some Persons of considerable Quality, or haply
some great Princes and Princesses, to recount
the Adventures of my Life, wouldst thou omit
a Circumstance of so much Moment ?

No indeed, Madam, said Lucy.
I am glad to hear thou art so discreet, fas,
Arabella ; and pray do me the Favour to relate
this Adventure to me, as thou wouldst do to
those Princes and Princesses, if thou wert commanded.


Here, Arabella making a full Stop, six'd her
Eyes upon her Woman, expecting every Moment
she would begin the desired Narrative-but
finding the continu'd fient longer than Methought
was necessary for recalling the several
Circumfiances of the Story into her Mind,

I find, said Ihe, it will be necessary to caution
you against making your Audience wait too
long for your Relation ; it looks as if you was
to make a studied Speech, not a simple Relation
of Fats, which ought to be free from all As-station
of Labour and Art; and be told with
that graceful Negligence which is so becoming
to Truth.

This I thought proper to tell you, added (he,
that you may not fall into that MitRLae when you
are called upon to relate my. Adventures -
Well, now if you please to begin. ,

K6 -r Wat,

What, pray, Madam, said Lucy ?
What, repeated Arabella ? Why, the Adventures
which happen' to me so lately. Relate
to me every Circumstance of my being
carried away, and how my Deliverance was es-seated
by my Cousin.

Indeed, Madam, said Lug, I know nothing
about your Ladyship's being carried away. All
I know is-begone,

cried Arabella losing all Patience at
her .Obstinacy, get out of my Presence this
Moment. Wretch, unworthy of my Confidence
and Favour, thy Treason is too manifest,
thou art brib'd by that presumptuous Man to
conceal all t!.c Circumstances of his Attempt
from my Knowledge, to the End that I may
net have a full Conviction of his Guilt.

Lucy, who never saw her Lady so much offended
before, and knew not the Occasion of
it, burst into Tears; which so aside the
tender Heart of Arabella, that losing insensibly
all her Anger, flie told her with a Voice folt-
n'd to a Tone of the utmost Sweetness and
Condescension, that provided she would confess
how far she had been prevail'd upon by his
rich PresentS, to forget her Duty, (he would
pardon and rtceiv.eher.again.into Failure

tell your Ladyship what he gave me. He gave
me this half Guinea, Madam, indeed he did;
but for all that, when he would come into
your Chamber I struggled with him, and cry'd
out, for fear he should carry your Ladyship
away-arabella,

lost in Astonishment and Shame at
hearing of so inconsiderable a Present made to
her Woman, the like of which not one of her
Romances could furnish her, ordered her immediately
to withdraw, not being willing she
should observe the Confusion this strange Bribe
had given her.

After (he had been gone some Time, (he endeavour'd
to compose her Looks, and went
down to the Dining-Room, where Sir Charles
and his Son and Daughter had been engag'd ina
Conversation concerning her, the Particulars
of which may be found in the first Chapter of
the next Book.
T-.e End of the Seventh BOOK.

Contains the Conversation referr'd to in

pious Pleasure had secretly trim
umph'd in the Extravagances her

beautiful Cousin had been guilty
of, was now sensibly disappointed
to find they had had so little EffEt on her Father
and Brother'; for instead of reflecting upon the
Absurdities to which they had been a Witness,
Mr. Glanville artfully pursued the Subject Arabella
suit before had been expatiating upon, taking notice
frequently of some Observations of hers, and

by a well contriv'd Repetition of her Words,
oblig'd his Father a second Time to declare that
his Niece had spoken extrcnmly well.

Mr. Glanville taking the Word, launch'd out
into such Praises of her Wit, that Miss Glanville,
no longer able to listen patiently, reply'd,

'Twas true Lady Bella sometimes said very
sensible Things; that 'twas a great Pity she was
not always in a reasonable Way of thinking,
or that her Intervals were not hungered

Intervals, Mils, said Glanville, pray
what do you mean by that Expression ?-

Why, pray, said Miss Glanville, don't you
think my Cousin is sometimes a little wrong in
the Head?

Mr. Glanville at there Words starting from
his Chair, took a Turn a-cross the Room in
great Discomposure, then slopping all of a sudden,
and giving his Sister a furious Look-charlotte,
said he, don't give me Cause to think
you are envious of your Cousin's superior Excellencies


Envious, repeated Miss Glanville, I envious
of my Cousin - I vow I fh wild never have
thought of .that-Indeed, Brother, you are
much mistaken; my Cousin's superior Excellencies
never gave me a Moment's Disturbances'
I must confers her unaccountable Whims
have often excited my

more of this, Charlotte, interrupted
Mr'. Glanville, as you value my Friendships
more of it-why,
really Son, said Sir Charles, my Niece
has very finance Whimsies sometimes. How
it came inter. Head to think Mr, Tires would
- ; attempt

attempt to carry her away, I can't imagine ?
For after all, he only prest rather too rudely
into her Chamber, for which, as you te, I
have forbidden his Visits.

That was of a Piece, said Miss Glanville
sneeringly to her Brother, with her asking you
if you had made Mr. Tinsel swear upon your
Sword, that he would never again attempt to
carry her away ; and applauding you for having
given him his Liberty, as the generous Watermen
did on the same Occasion.

I would advise you, Charlotte, said Mr. Glanville,
not to aim at repeating your Cousin's
Words, till you know how to pronounce them
properly.

Oh ! that's one of her superior Excellencies,
said. Miss Glanville.

Indeed, Mi¬£, said Glanville very provokingly,
she is superior to you in many Things; and as
much so in the Goodness of her Heart, as in
the Beauty of her Person-come,

come, Charles, said the Baronet,
who observed his Daughter sat swelling and biting
her Lip at this Reproach, personal Reflections,
are better avoided. Your Sister is very welland
not to be disparaged tho' to be sure, Lady
Bella is the finest Woman 1 ever saw in my
Life. Miss Glanville was, if possible, more disgusted
at her Father's Palliation than her Brother's Reproaches;
and in order to give a Loose to her
Pafion, accus'd Mr. Glanville of a Decrease in
his Affecion for her, since he had been in Love
with her Cousin'; and having found this Excuse
for her Tears, very freely gave vent to theme.

Glanville being softned by this Sight, sacrificed
a few Compliments to her Vanity,
which soon restored her to her ufualTranquillityi
then turning the Discourse on his beloved Arabella,
pronounc'd a Panegyrick on her Virtues
and Accomplishments of an Hour long; which,
if it did not absolutely persuade his Sister to
change her Opinion, it certainly convinc'd his
Father, that his Niece was not only perfectly
well in misunderstanding, but even better than
most others of her Sex.

Mr. Glanville had suit finiif'd her Eulogium,
when Arabella appear'd; Joy danc'd in his
Eyes at her Approach; he gaz'd upon her with
a Kind of conscious Triumph in his Looks;
her consummate Loveliness justifying his Passion,
and being in his Opinion, more than an
Excuse for all her Extravagancies.

CH P. II.
In which our Heroine, as we presume,

Jews herself in two very different
igbts,
ARAB ELLA, who at her Entrance had
M. perceiv'd. some Traces of Uneasiness upon
Mis Glanville's Countenance, tenderly ask'd her
the Came ;. to which that young Lady answering
in a cold and reserved aniert. Mr. Glanville,
to divertlhexr inflexions it, very freely
accus'd.hiinfelff f 'having'given hi: Silver some'
Offence. To biiure, Brother, faidkIifs Glianile'

you are very vehement in your Temper, and
are as violently carry'd away about Things of
little Importance as of the greatest ; and then,
whatever you have a Fancy for, you love lo
obstinately.

I am oblig'd to you, Miss, interrupted
Mr. Glanville, for endeavouring to give .Lady
Bella so unfavourable an Opinion of me

I assure you, said Arabella, Miss Glanville has
said nothing to your Disadvantage: For, in my
Opinion, the Temperament of great Minds
ought to be such as she represents yours to be.
For there is nothing at so great a Distance from
true and heroickVirtue, as that Indifference
which obliges some People to be pleas'd with all
Things or nothing: Whence it comes to pass,
that they neither entertain great Desires of Glory,
nor Fear of Infamy ; that they neither love
nor hate; that they are wholly influenc'd by
Custom, and are sensible only of the Affections
of the Tidy, their Minds being in a Manner
insensible ,

To say the Truth, I am inclin'd to conceive
a greater Hope of a Man, who in the Beginning
of his Life is hurry'd away by some evil
Habit, than one that fates on nothing: The
Mind that cannot be brought to desert Vice,
will never be persuaded to love Virtue; but one
who is capable of loving or hating irreconcilable,
by having, when young, his Passions directed
to proper Objects, will remain six'd in
his Choice of what is good. But with him who
is incapable of any violent Attraction, and
whose Heart is chilled by a general Indifference,
Precept or Example will have no Force-and

Philosophy itself, which boasts it hath Remedies
for all Indispositions of the Soul, never
had any that can cure an indifferent Mind -
Nay, added she, I am persuaded that Indifference
is generally the ilfCp?.rahle Companion of
a weak and imperfect Judgment. For it is so
natural to a Person to be carry'd towards that
which he believes to be good, that if indifferent
People were able to judge of Things, they would
fasten on something. But certain it is that this
luke-warmness of Soul, which finds forth but
feeble Desires, sends also but feeble Lights; so
that those who are guilty of it, not knowing
any thing clearly, cannot fasten on any thing
with Perseverance.

Mr. Glanville, when Arabella had finish'd
this Speech, cast a triumphing Glance at his
Sister, who had asserted great In-attention all
the while the had been speaking. Sir Charles
in his Way, expressed much Admiration of her
Wit, telling her, if she had been a Man, file
would have niade a great Figure in Parliament,
and that her Speeches might have come perhaps
to. be printed in time.

This Compliment, odd as it was, gave great
Joy to Glanville, when the Conversation was
interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. Selvin, who
had slipt away unobserved at the Time that
Arabella's Indisposition had alarm'd them, and
now came to.enquire after her Health; and also
if an Opportunity offer'd to set her right with
Regard to the Suspicions she had entertain'd of
his designing to pay his Address to her.

Arabella, as soon as he had sent in his Name,
appear'd to be in great Disturbance; and upon

his Entrance, offer'd immediately to withdraw,
telling Mr. Glanville, who would have detain'd
her, that the sound no Place was likely to secure
her from the Persecutions of that Gentleman.


Glanville stared, and look'd strangely perplex'd
at this Speech; Miss Glanville smiled,
and poor Slvin, with a very silly Look-hem'd
two or three times, and then with a faltering
Accent said, Madam, I am very much concern'd
to find your Ladyship resolv'd to persist
in-sir,

interrupted Arabella, my Resolutions
are unalterable. I told you so before, and am
surprized, after the Knowledge of my Intentions,
you presume to appear in my Presence
again, from whence I had So positively banished
you.

Pray, Niece, laid Sir Charles, what has
Mr. Seven done to disoblige you

Sir, reply'd Arabella, Mr. Selvin's Offence
can admit of no other Reparation than that
which I requir'd of him, which was a voluntary
Banishment from my Presence: And in
this pursued she, I am guilty of no more Severity
to you, than the Princess Utopia was to the
unfortunate Yhrafimdes. For the Passion of
this Prince having come to her Knowledge,
notwithstanding the Pains he took to conceal it,
this fair and wise Princess thought it not enough
to forbid his speaking to her, but also banished
him from her Presence; laying a peremptory
Command upon him, never to appear before
her again till he was perfectly cur'd of that unhappy
Love he had entertain'd for her-Imitate

therefore the meritorious Obedience of this poor
Prince, and if that Passion you profess for me-how,

Sir, interrupted Sir Charles, Do you
make Love to my Niece'then ?.-

Sir, replied Mr. Seven, who was strangely
confounded at Arabella's Speech, tho' I really
admire the Perfections this Lady is possess'd of,
yet I assure you, upon my Honour, I never had
a Thought of making any Addresses to her
and I can't imagine why her Ladyship persists
in accusing me of such Presumption.

So formal a Denial after what Arabella had
said, extremely perplex'd Sir Charles, and filled
Mr. Glanville with inconceivable Shame-miss

Glanville enjoy'd their Disturbance, and
full of an ill-natur'd Triumph, endeavour'd to
look Arabella into Confusion : But that Lady
not being at all discomposed by this Declaration
of Mr. Servi's, having accounted for it already,
replied with great Calmness,

Sir, 'Tis easy to see thro' the Artifice of your
disclaiming any Passion for me-Upon any other
Occasion questionless, you would rather sacrifice
your Life, than consent to disavow these
Sentiments, which unhappily for your Peace
you have entertain'd. At present the Desire of
continuing near me, obliges you to lay this
Confiraint upon yourself; however you know
7'hrafimedes fell upon the same Stratagem to no
Purpose. The rigid Utopia saw thro' the Disguise,
and would not dispense with herself from
banishing him from Rome, as I do you from
England

Yes, Sir, replied Arabella hastily, nothing
less can satisfy what I owe to the Consideration
of my own Glory.

Upon my Word, Madam, said Sevin, half
angry, and yet strongly inclin'd to laugh, I
don't see the Necessity of my quitting my native
Country, to satisfy what you owe to the
Consideration of your own Glory. Pray, how
does my fraying in England asses your Ladyflip's
Glory ?

To answer your Question with another, said
Arabella, Pray how did the Stay of 'archimedes
in Rome, assert the Glory of the Empress
Dia a .

Mr, Sedvin was struck dumb with this Speech,
for he was not willing to he thought so deficient
iu the Knowledge of History, as not to be acquainted
with the Reasons why rThrajimedes
Should not slay in Rome.

His Silence therefore seeming to Arablla to
be a tacit Confession of the Justice of her Commands,
a Sentiment of Compassion for this unfortunate
Lover, intruded itself into her Mind 3
and turning her bright Eyes, full of a soft Complacency
upon Selvin, who stared at her as if he
had lost his Wits

will not, said she, wrong the Sublimity of
your Passion for me so much, as to doubt your
being ready to sacrifice the Repose of your own
Life to the Satisfaction of mine: Nor will I
do so much Injustice to your Generosity, as to
suppose the Glory of obeying my Commands,
will not in some Measure soften the Rigour of
your Deffiny-I know not whether it may. be
lawful for me to tell you, that your Misfortune

does really cause me some Affliction ; but I am
willing to give you this Consolation, and also
to assure you, that to whatever Part of the
World your Despair will carry you, the good
Withes and Compassion of Arabella shall follow
you-having

said this, with one of her fair Hands
she cover'd her Face, to hide the Blushes which
so compassionate a Speech had caus'd-Holding
the other extended with a careless Air, supposing
he would kneel to kiss it, and bathe it
with his Tears, as was the Custom on such melancholy
Occasions, her Head at the france Time
turned another Way, as if reluctantly and
with Confusion she granted this Favour.
But after standing a Moment in this Posture,
and finding her Hand untouch'd, she concluded
Grief had depriv'd him of his Senses, and that
he would shortly fall into a Swoon as Thrafime-
des did : And to prevent being a Witness of so
doleful a Sight, Tbe hurry'd out of the Room
without once turning about, and having reach'd
her own Apartment, sunk into a Chair, not a
little affected with the deplorable Condition in
which the had left her supposed miserable Lover.

The Contra f continued.
HE Company she had left behind her being
all, except Mr. Glanville, to the lait
Degree surprized at Her Strange Words and

Nations, continued mute for several Minutes
after she was gone, flaring upon one another,
as if each wish'd to know the other's Opinion
of such an unaccountable Behaviour. At last
Miss Glanville, who observed her Brother's BAck
was towards her, told Mr. Selvin in a low
Voice, that she hop'd he would call and take
his Leave of them before he set out for the
Place where his Despair would carry him.-

Mr. Selv;n in spite of his natural Gravity,
could not forbear laughing at this Speech of
Miss Glanville's, which shocked her Brother,
and not being able to slay where Arabella was
.ridicul'd, nor intitled to resent it, which would
have been a manifest Injustice on that Occasion,
lie retir'd to his own Apartment to give vent to
that Spleen which in those Moments made him
out of Humour with all the World.

Sir Charles, when he was gon,, indulg'd
himself in a little Mirth on his Niece's Extravagance,
pi testing he did not know what to do
with her. Upon which Miss Glanville observed,
that it was a Pity there were not such Things
as Protestant Nunneries ; giving it as her Opinion,
that her Cousin ought to be confin'd in
one of those Places, and never ushered to see
any Company, by which Means (he would avoid
exposing herself in the Manner she did now.

Mr. Sevin, who possibly thought this a reasonable
Scheme of Miss Glanville's, seemed by
his Silence to assent to her Opinion; but Sir
Charles was greatly displeased with his Daughter
for expressing herself so freely; alledging that
Arabella, when the was out of those Whims,
was a very sensible young Lady, and sometimes

talk'd as learnedly as a Divine. To which
Mr. Selvin also added, that fie had a great
Knowledge of History, and had a most surprising
Memory; and after some more Discourse
to the same Purpose, he took his Leave,
earnestly entreating Sir Charts to believe that
he never entertain'd any Design of making his
.Addresses to Lady Bella.

In the mean Time, that Lady after having
given near half an Hour to t!xif Reflexion
which occur to Heroines in the same Situation
with herself, called for Lucy, and ordered her
to go to the Dining-Room, and see in what
Condition Mr Selvin was, telling her Ihe had
certainly left him in a Swoon, as also the occasion
of it; and bid her give him all the consolation
in her Power.

Lucy, with Tears in her Eyes at this Recital,
went down as (he was order'd, and entering the
Room without any Ceremony, her Thoughts
being wholly six'd on the melancholy Circumstance
her Lady had been telling her; lie look'd
eagerly round the Room without speaking a
Word, till Sir Charles and Mils Glanville, who
thought (he had been sent with same Message
from Arabella, ask'd her Loth at the same instant,
What (he wanted ?

I came, Sir, said Lucy, repeating her Lady's
Words, to se in what Condition Mr. Selvin is
min, and to give him all the Station in my
Power.

Sir C'ha;tls, laughing heartily at this Speech,
asked her what file could du ior Mr. Sein ?
To which fie reply'd, he did not know ; but

VOL, I. .L Le.

her Lady had told. her to give him all the Solation
in her Power.

:inflation thou wouldst say, I suppose, said
Sir .Charles.

Yes, Sir, said Lucy curtsying. Well, Child,
added he, go up and tell your Lady, Mr. Slvin
does not need any Consolation.

Lucy accordingly return'd with this Message,
and was met at the Chamber-door by Arabella,
who hastily ask'd her if Mr. Selvin was recover'd
from his Swoon: To which Lucy irply'd
that she did not know; but that Sir CIjarle4s
bid her tell her Ladyship, Mr. Slvin did not
need any Consolation.
Oh Heaves ! cry'd Arabella, throwing herself
into a Chair as pale as Death-He is dead,
he has fallen upon his Sword, and put an End
to his Life and Miseries at once-Oh! how.un-
happy am I, cry'd she, bursting into Tears to
be the Cause of so cruel an Accident - Was
ever any Fate so terrible 2s mine - Was ever
Beauty so fatal - Was ever Rigour so unfortunately
will the Quiet of my future Days
be disturbed by the sad Remembrance of a Man
whose Death was caused by my Disdainful
why, resumed she after a little Pause-Why do
I thus afflict myself for what has happen'd by an
unavoidable Necessity ? No am I singular in
the Misfortune which has befallen me-Did not
the sad Perinthus die for the beautiful Pantheistic
not the Rigour of Basin bring the miserable
Oxyatres to the Grave-And the Severity
Of Statira make Oroondates fall upon his Sword
in her Presence, tou' happily he escaped being
kill'd by it - Let us then not afflict ourselves

unreasonably at this sad Accident Let us lament
as we ought the fatal Effects of our
Charms-But let us comfort ourselves with the
Thought that we have only aacd conformable
to our Duty.

Arabella having pronounc'd there last Words
with a solemn and lofty Accent, order'd Lucy,
who listen'd to her with Eyes drowned in Teals,
to go down and ask if the Body was remov'd-for
added (he, all my Constancy will not be
sufficient to support me against that pitiful
Sight.

Lucy accordingly deliver'd her Message to
Sir Charles and Miss Glanville, who were still
together, discoursing on the fantastical Sura of
Arabella, when the Knight, who could not
possibly comprehend what she meant by asking
if the Body was removed, bid her tell her Lady
he desired to speak with her.

Arabella, upon receiving this Summons, set
herself to consider what could be the Intent of
it. If Mr. Selvin be dead, said the, what Good
cant my Presence do among them ? Surely it
cannot be to upbraid me with my Severity, that
my Uncle desires to see me-No, it would be
unjust to suppose it. Questionless my unhappy
Lover is still struggling with the Pangs of Death,
and for a Consolation in his last Moments, implores
the Favour of resigning up his Life in my
Sight. Pausing a little at there Words, she rose
from her Seat with a Resolution to give the
her Pardon before he dy'd. Meeting
Mr. Glanville as he was returning from his
Chamber to the Dining-Roorr, she told him,
she hop'd the Charity the was going to discover'

L 2 toward

towards his Rival, would not give Filii any
Uneasiness; and preventing his Reply byr gillng
hastily into the Room, he followed he" dreadful,
same new Extravagance, yet not able to prevent
it, endeavour'd to conceal his Confuse 'n Iron her
Observation-Arabella after breathing a gentle
Sigh told told Sir Charts, that she was come to
grant Mr. Sldvin her Pardon for the Offence he
had been guilty of, that he might depart in
Peace.

Well, well, said Sir Char-les, he is departed in
Peace without it.

How, Sir, interrupted Arabella, is he dead
then ahead ? Alas! why had he not the satisfaction
of seeing me before he expired, that his
Foul night have departed in Peace! He would
have been assured not only of ny Pardon, but
Pity also; and that Assurance would have made
him happy in his last Moments.

Why, Niece, interrupted Sir Charles flaring,
you surprize me prodigious: Are you in
ea nest ?

Questionless I am, Sir, said she, nor ought you
to'be surprized at the C ncern I express for the
Fates this unhappy Man, nor at the Pardon I
props sed to have granted him ; since herein I am
justified by the Example of many great and
virtuous Princesses, who have done as much,
?ay, haply more than I intended to have done,
fr Persons whose Offences were greater than
Mr. Selvirns.

I-am very sorry, Madam, said Sir Charles,
t3 hear you talk in this Manner: 'Tis really
enough to make one fufptEt you arc

You do me great Injustice, Sir, interrupted
Arabella if you fiifpeit me to be guilty of any
unbecoming Weakness for this Man: If barely
expressing my Compassion for his Misfortunes
be cfleem'd so great a Favour, what would you
have thought if I had supported his Head on my
Knees while he was dying, .shed. 'lars over
hint, and discovered all the Tokens of a sincere
Afil',ifln for him ?-

Good God ! said Sir Charles lifting up his
Eyes, Did any body ever hear of any thing like
this ?

What, Sir, said Arabella, with as great an
Appearance of Surprize in her Countenance as
his had discovered, Do you say you never heard
of any thing like this ? Then you never heard
of the Princess of Media, I fupp.f e-

No,' not I, Madam, said Sir Charles peevishly.
Then,- Sir, refunded Arabella, permit me to
tell you, that this fair and virtuous Princess
condescended to do all I have mention'd for the
fierce Ladbnet, Prince of Assyria ; who tho' he
had mortally offended her by tL.aling her away
but of the Court of the King her Father, ,:
whence e w.s wounded to Death in
her 'Presence, and humbly implor'd her Pardon
before he died, (he condescended as I have fas,,
to support him on her Knees, and shed Ta s
for his Disaster - I could produce many mere
Instances of the like Compafion in Ladies
highly born as herself, tho' perhaps their
Quality was not quite so illustrious, she being
the Heiress bftwo'powerful Kingdoms Yet
to-mention only these .

L 3 Good

Good Heav'ns ! cry'd Mr. Glanville here,
being quite out of Patience, I (hall go disgraced


Arabella surprized at this Exclamation, look'd
car nec fly at him for a Moment-and then ask'd
him, Whether any thing fie had said had given
him Uneasiness ?

Yes, upon my Soul, Madam, said Glanville
so vex'd and confus'd that he hardly knew what
he said .

I am sorry for it, reply'd Arabella gravely,
and also am greatly concerned to find that in
Generosity yeu are so much exceeded by the illustrious
Cyrus; who was so far from taking
Umbrage at Mandana's Behaviour to the dying
Prince, that he commended her for the compassion
she had shewn him. So also did the
blue and generous Oroondates, when the fair
Satira;r

By Heav'ns ! cry'd Glanville rising in a Passion,
there's no hearing this. Pardon me,
Madam, but upon my Soul, you'll make me
hang myself.

'Hang yourself, repeated Arabella, fuit you
know not what you say-you meant I suppose,
that you'll fall upon your Sword. What
Hero ever threatned to give himself so vulgar
a Death ? But pray let ne know the Cause of
your Despair, so sudden and so violent.

Mr. Glanville continuing in a sort of sullen
Silence, Arabella raising her Voice went on;

Tho' Ido not conceive myself oblig'4'trgiwe
you an Account of my Conduct, seeing that I
have only permitted you yet to hope for my
Favour; yet I owe to myself and my own

Honour the Justification I am going to make,
Knew then, that however suspicious my compassion
for Mr. Selvin may appear to your mi-taken
Judgment, yet it has its Foundation
only in the Generosity of my Disposition, which
inclines me to pardon the Fault when the unhappy
Criminal repents; and to afford him my
Pity when his Circumstances require it. Let
not therefore the Charity I have discovered towards
your Rival, be the Cause of your despair,
since my Sentiments for him were he
living, would be what they were before ; that
is, full of Indifference, nay, haply Disdain.
And fisher nut yourself to be so carried away
by a violent and unjust Jealousy, as to threaten
your own Death, which if you really had any
Ground for your Suspicions, and truly lov'd me,
would come unsought for, tho' not undesired
indeed, was your Despair reasonable, Death
would necessarily follow it; for what Lover can
live under so desperate a Misfortune. In that
Case you may meet Death undauntedly when it
comes, nay, embrace it with Joy; but truly
the killing one's self is but a faire Picture of true
Courage, proceeding rather from Fear of a further
Evil, than Contempt of that you fly to:
For if it were a Contempt of Pain, the same
Principle would make you resolve to bear patiently
and fearlessly all kin] of Pains; and
Hope being of all other the most contrary Thing
to Fear, this being an utter Banishment of Hope,
seems to have its Ground in Fear.

follow'd by Miss Glanville, to whom she had
made a Sign for that Purpose; and throwing
herself into a Chair, burst into Tears, which
greatly surprising Mils Glanville , flie prest her
to tell her the Caufc.

Alas ! reply'd Arabella, have I not Cause to
think myself extremely unhappy ? The deplorable
Death of Mr. Slivl, the Despair to which
I see ,our Brother reduc'd, with the fatal consequences
which may attend it, fills me with a
mortal Uneasiness.

Well, said Miss Glanville, your Ladyship
may make yourself quite easy as to both these
Matters; for Mr. Sldvin is not dead, nor is my
Brother in Despair that I know of.

What do you say, Miss, interrupted. Arablla,
is not Mr. Selvin dead ? Was the Wound he
gave himself not mortal then ?

I know of no Wound that he gave himself,
not I, said Miss Glanville; what makes your
Ladyship suppose he gave himself a W tond.4
Lord bless me, what strange Thoughts come:
into your Head, . - ,, ,ser ;

Truly lam rejoices tother lit, repsyd : a-

Defpair,.^I'1l instantly. dispatch my Commands
to him to live. I

I dire answer for his Obc(icdieie, Madam,
aid aMi¬£ GLii-illi filling.
Arabella then gave Odecrs for Ppr-r and Pens
to be brought her, and (fe ing Mr. G'i,;'vi/ enter
the Room, very formally acquainted him
with her Intention, telling him, that he ought
to be satisfied with the Banishment to which
the had doom'd his unhappy Rival, and not require
his Death, since he had nothing to fear
from his Pretensions.

I assure you, Madam, said Mr. Glanville', I
am perfectly easy upon that Account: And in
order to spare you the Trouble of finding to
Mr. Selvin, I may venture to assure you that he
is in no Danger of dying.

'Tis impossible, Sir, reply'd Arabella, according
to the Nature of Things, 'tis impossible
but he must already be very near Death-you
know the Rigour of my Sentence, you
know

I know, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, that
Mr. Selvin does not think himself under a necessity
of obeying your Sentence ; and has the
Impudence to question your Authority for banishing
him from his native Country.
.My Authority, Sir, said Arabella strangely
surprized, is founded upon the absolute Power
he has given me over him.

He denies that, Madam, said Glanville, and
says that he neither can give, nor you exercise
an absolute Power over him; since you are
both accountable to the King, whose Subjects
you are, and both restrained by the Laws under
whose Sanction you live.

L $ Arabella's

Arabella's apparent Confusion at these Words
giving Mr. Glanville Hopes that lie had fallen
upon a proper Method to cure her of fume of
her strange Notions, he was going to pursue his
Arguments, when Arabella looking a little
sternly upon him,

The Empire of Love, said she, like the Empire
of Honour, is govern'd by Laws of its
own, which have no Dependence pon, or Relation
to any other. ' o


Pardon me, Madam, said Glamnill, if I presume
to differ front you. Our'Las have six'd
'the Boundaries of Honour as well as'thgfe of
Love.

How is that possible, rep'y'd Arabella, When
they differ so widely, that a Man may bejufti-
jy'd'by the one, and' yet condemn'd by the
ther ? For Instance, pitied she, you are not
permitted by the aI'ws' of the Land to 'take
away the Life of any Person whatever; yet fe

'1 Jl/eii'fed 'to a Demonstration, that what
is called Honour is something difiti from Suffice,
' fince!'they command Thing. aJbdJutey

Arabella without reflecting on this Inference,
went on to prove the independent Sovereignty
of Love, which, said she, may be collected
from all the Words and Actions of those Heroes
who were inspired by this Passion. We see it
in them, pursued the, triumphing not only overall
natural and avow'd Allegiance, but superior
even to Friendship, Duty, and Honour itself.
This the Nations of Oroondates, Artaxerxes,
Mithridates, and many other illustrious Princes
sufficiently testify.

Love requires a more unlimited Obedience
from its Slaves, than any other Monarch can
expect from his Subjects ; an Obedience which
is circumscribed by no Laws whatever, and dependent
upon nothing but itself.

I that live, Madam, says the renowned
Prince of Scythia to the divine Statira, I shall
,live, since it is your Command I should do so;
and Death can have no Power over a Life which
you are pleas'd to take Care of.-

Say only that you wish I should conquer,

with those which dignify the Sovereigns of
Hearts, such as divine Artfitiefs of my Fate,

others equally sublime.

G:r. Granville I( sing all patience at her lci-

Miss Glanvi,;l, whose Envy and Dislike
of her lovely Cousin was heightened by
her Suspicions that the disputed with her the
Possession of Sir George's Heart, (he having

Gentleman, ws extremely delighted with the
Ridicule her absurd Behaviour had drawn upon

Cousins ' ' '

* --'''Mi√≥i

Mils G'anvsii;i being by shelf Means rid of a
Rival too powerful even to contend with, went
with more than usual Gaiety to tie Assembly,
where the Extravagancies of Arabella afforded
a perpetual Fund for Diversion. Her more
than passive Behaviour upon this Occasion, banishing
all Restraint among those file convers'd
with, the Joel circulated very freely at .arabella's
Expense. Nor did Miss Glanvizi' fail to give
new Poignancy to their Sarcasms, by artfully
disclosing the bent of her Coulin's Studies, and
enumerating the many Absurdities they had
made her guilty of.

Airabella's uncommon Beauty had gain' her
so many Enemies among the Ladies that compos'd
this Assembly, that they seemed to contend
with each other who should ridicule her
most. The celebrated Countess of being
then at Bath, approach'd a Circle of these
fair Defamers, and lifting a few Moments to
the contemptuous Jests they threw out against
the absent Beauty, (declared herself in her Favour;
which in a Moment, such was the Force
of her universally acknowledg'd Merit, and the
Deference always pay'd to her Opinion, silenced
every pretty Impertinent around her.

This Lady, who among her own Sex had no
Superior in Wit, Elegance, and Ear, was inferior
to very few of the other in Sense, Learning,
and Judgment. Her Skill in Poetry,
Painting, and. Musick, tho' incontestably great,
was number'd among. the leapt of her Accom-
pltifiniientsi - er;Candour, her Sweetness, her
Modesty and Benevolence, while they secured.
ir. from the Darts of Envy, render'd her superior

to Praise, and made the one as unnecessary
as the other ineffectual.

She had been a Witness of the Surprise
Arabia's extraordinary Appearance had occasioned,
and frock with that as well as the uncommon
Charms of her Person, had prest near
her with several others of the Company, when
she was discoursing in the Manner we have related.


A Person of the Countess's nice Discern,
went could not fail of observing the. Wit and
Spirit, which tho' obscured, was not absolutely
hid under the Absurdity of her Notions
And this Discovery adding Esteem to
the Compassion she felt for the fair Visionary,
fBe resolved to rescue her from the ill-natur'd
Raillery of her Sex; praising therefore her
Understanding, and the Beauty of her Person
with a; Sweetness and Generosity peculiar to
herself, she accounted in the most delicate
Manner imaginable for the Singularity of her
Notions, from her Studies, her Retirement, her
Ignorance of the World, and her lively Imagination.
And to abate the Keenness of their
Sarcasms, acknowledg'd, that (he herself had
when, very young, been deep read in Romances
; and but for an early Acquaintance with
the World, and being directed to other Studies,
was likely to have been as much a Heroine as
Lady Bella.

liss Glanville, tho' (he was secretly vex'd at
this Defence of her Cousin, was however under
a Necessity of seeming oblig'd to the Countess
for it: And that Lady expressing a Desire to be
acquainted with, Lady Bella Miss Glanville

respectfully offer'd to attend her Cousin to her
Lodgings, which the Countess as respectively
declin'd, saying, As Lady Bella was a Stranger,
she would make her the first Visit.

Mis Glanville at her Return gave her Brother
an Account of what had happen'd at the
Assembly, and fill'd him with an inconceivable
Joy at the Countess's Intention. He had always
been a zealous Admirer of that Lady's
Character, and flatter'd himself that the conversation
of so admirable a Woman would be
of the utmost Use to Arabella.

That very Night he mention'd her to his beloved
Cousin; and after enumerating all her
fine Qualities, declar'd that she had already conceiv'd
a Friendship for her, and was solicitous of
her Acquaintance.

I think myself extremely fortunate, replied
Arabella, in that I have (tho' questionless un-deservedly)
acquir'd the Amity of this lovely
Person ; and I beg you, pursued she to Miss
Glanville, to tell her, that I long with Impatience
to embrace her, and to give her that
Share in my Heart which her transcendent Merit
deserves.

Miss Glanville only bow'd her Head in answer
to this Request, giving her Brother at the
same Time a significant Leer ; who tho' used
to Arabella's Particularities, could not help being
a little confounded at the heroick Speech
she had made.

S .

CHAP. VI.
Containing something which atfrfi Sight

may probably puzzle the Reader.
HE Countess was as good as her Word,
and two Days after sent a Card to arabella,
importing her Design to wait on her that
Afternoon.

Our Heroine expected her with great Impatience,
and the Moment the enter'd the Room
flew towards her with a graceful Eagerness, and
straining her in her Arms, embraced her withall
the Fervour of a long absent Friend.

Sir Charles and Mr. Glanville were equally
embarrassed at the Familiarity of this Address ;
but observing that the Countess seemed not to
be surprized at it, but rather to receive it with
Pleasure, they were soon compos'd.

You cannot imagine, lovely Stranger, said
Arabella to the Counties, as soon as they were
seated, with what Impatience I have long'd to
behold you, since the Knowledge I have receiv'd
of your rare Qualities, and the Friendship you
have been pleas'd to honour me with-And I
may truly protest to you, that such is my Admiration
of your Virtues, that I would have
gone to the farthest Part of the World to render
you that which you with so much Generosity
have condescended to bellow upon me.

Sir Charles shared at this extraordinary Speech,
and not being able to comprehend a Word of
it, was concern'd to think how the Lady to
whom it was addressed would underhand it.

Mr. Glanrvi!e look'd down, ani bit his Nails
in extreme Confiulon ; but the Countess who
hid not foot the language of Romance,
the Compliment in a Strain as heroick rs

'I'hc Favour I have receives sion Fortune,
said isle, in bringing me to the H phineas
of our Acquittance, charming iabcla, is
;l great, that I ny rationally expect Come terrible
Misfortune will befall mc Seeing that in
.this Life our Pleasures are so constantly succeeded
by Pain, that we hardly ever enjoy the one
without fuflelririg the other scion after.

Ai-aibda was quite transported to hear the
Countess express herself in Language so conformable
to her own; but Mr. Glanville was
greatly confounded, and began to suspect she was
diverting herself with his Cousin's Singularities:
And Sir Charles was within a little of thinking
her as much out of the Way as his Niece.

Misfortunes, Madam, f id Arabella, are too
often the Lot of excellent Pe sons like yourself.
The sublimest among Mortals both for Beauty
and Virtue have experienc'd the Frowns of Fate.
The Sufferings of the divine Statira or CaOfan-
dr,; for file bore both Names, imperfections
of the incomparable Cleopatra, the Distresses of
the beautiful Candace, and the Afflictions of the
fair and generous Mandana, are Proofs that the
most illustrious Persons in the World have felt
the Rage of Calamity.

It-nut he confessed, said the Countess, that
all those fair Priceleffesiyou'have nlm'd, were
for a whiledxtwrerhely unfortunate: 'Yet in the
Catalogue 6of'thefe lovely and afflicted Persons

you have forgot one who might with Justice
dispute the Priority of Sufferings with them alli
mean the beautiful Elifa, Princess of Parthia.

Pardon me, Madam, reply'd Arabella, I cannot
be of your Opinion. ThePrincefs of Parthia
may indeed justly be rank'd among the
Number of unfortunate Persons, but the can
by no means dispute the melancholy Precedence
with the divine Cleopatra-For in fine, Madam,
what Evils did the Princess of Parthia sussex
which the fair Cleopatra did not likewise endure,
and some of them haply in a g;,rater Degree
? If Eiifa by the tyrannical Authority of
the King her Father, saw herself upon te Point
of becoming the Wife of a Prince she detested,
was not the beautiful Daughter of Antony, by
the moreunjultifiableTyranny of urgujlus, likely
to be forced into the Arms of Tiberius, a proud
and cruel Prince, who was odious to the whole
World as well as to her ? If Ei]fa was for sometime
in the Power of Pyrates, was not Cleopatra
Captive to an inhuman King, who presented
his Sword to the fair Breast of that divine
Princess worthy the Adoration of the
whole Earth ? And in fine, if Elifa had the
Grief to see her dear Ai-laban imprisoned by the
Order of Augur us, Cleopatra beheld with mortal
Agonies, her beloved Coriolanus inclos'd
amidst the Guards oi that enrag'd Prince and
doom'd to a cruel Death.

'Tis certain, Madam, reply'd the Countess,
that the Misfortunes of both these Princess
were very great, tho' as you have shew'd me
with some Inequality: And when one reflects
upon the dangerous Adventures to which Persons

of their Quality were exposed in thoefc
Times, one cannot help rejoicing that we live
in an Age in which the Cufloins, Manners,
Habits, and Inclinations differ so widely from
theirs, that 'tis impossible such Adventures
should even happen.

Such is the strange Alteration of Things, that
bfme People I dare say at present, cannot b- persuaded
to believe there ever were Princesses wandering
thro' the World by Land and Sea in mean
Disguises, carry'd away violently out of their Father's
Dominions by insolent Lovers - Some
discovered sleeping in Forests, other Shipwreck'd
on desolate Islands, confin'd in Castles, bound
in Chariots, and even shrugging amidst the tempestuous
Waves of the Sea, into which they
had cast themselves to avoid the brutal Force of
their.Ravi(hers. Not one of these Things having
happen'd within the Compass of several
thousand Years, People unlearn'd in Antiquity
would be apt to deem them idle Tales, so improbable
do they appear at present.

Arabella, tho' greatly surprized at this Discourse,
did not think proper to express her
Thoughts of it. She was unwilling to appear
absolutely ignorant of the present Customs of
the World, before a Lady whose good Opinion
(he was ardently desirous of imp: owing. Her
Prepossessions in favour of the Countess made
her receive the new Delights she held out to her
with Refpet, tho' not without Doubt and Irresolution.
Her Blushes, her Silence, and
down-caf Eyes gave the Countess to understand
Part of her Thoughts; who for fear of alarming
her too much for that Time, dropt the

Subj;c, and turning the Converts ion on onihe-
more general, gave-aohela an Opportunity of
mingling in it with that Wit and Vivacity,
which was natural to her when Romance
were out of the Question.

CH AP. VII.
kn which if the Reader has not anticipated

it, be will find an Explanation
of sone seeming Ifcojifietcies in the
foregoing Chapter.
T -
HE Counters, charm'd with the Wit

and good Sense of Arabella, could not
conceal her Admiration, but exprest it in Terms
the most obligingly imaginable: And Arabella,
who was excessively delighted with her, return'd
the Compliments she made her with the most
respectful Tenderness.

In the midi of these mutual Civilities,
Arabella in the Style of Romance, intreated
the Countess to favour her with the Recital of
her Adventures.

At the Mention of this Requefi, that Lady
convey'd so much Confusion into her Countenance,
that Arabella extremely embarrassed by
it, tho' she knew not why, thought it nccc-
far to apologize for the Disturbance she seemed
to have occasioned in her.

Pardon me, Madam, reply'd the Countess
cove ing herself, if the uncommonly of your
Request made a Moment's Reflexion necessary

to con . that a young; Lady of your
Sens; and delicacy could mean no Offence to
Decorum by making it. Tie Word Adventures
carries in it so free and li envious a Sound
in the Apprehensions of People at this Period
if Time, that it can hardly with Propriety be
apply'd to those few and natural Incidents which
compose the Hifiory of a Woman of Honour,
And when I tell you, pursued (he with smile,
that I was born and christened, had a ireful
and proper Education, receiv'd the Addresses of
my Lord through the Recommendation
ot my Parents, and marry'd him with their
Consents and my own Inclinations and thai:
since we have liv'd in great Harmony together,
I have told you all the material Passages of my
Life, which upon Enquiry you will find differ
very little from those of other Women of the
fame Ran', who have a moderate Share oi
Sense, Prudence and Virtue.

Since you have already, Madam, replied
.,;alzella blushing, excus'd me for the Liberty
I took with you, it will be un-necessary to tell
you it was grounded upon the Customs of antient
Times, when Ladies of the highest Rank
and sublimest Virtue, were often expos'd to a
Variety of cruel Adventures which they imparted
in Confidence to each other, when
Chance brought them together.
Custom, said the Countess smiling, changes the
very Nature of Things, and what was honourable
a thoufandYears ago,may probably be look'd
upon as infamous now-A Lady in the heroick
Age you speak of, would not be thought to possess
any great Share of Merit, if (he had not

been many times carried away by one or other
of her insolent Lovers: Whereas a Beauty in
this could not pals thro' the Hands of several
different Ravishers, without bringing an Imputation
on her Chastity.

The same Assigns which made a Man a
Hero in those Times, would constitute him a
Murderer in These-And the same Steps which
led him to a Throne Then, would infallibly
conduct him to a Scaffold Now. '

But Custom, Madam, laid drabeldl, cannot
possibly change the Nature of Virtue or Vice:
And since Virtue is the chief Charaaerikick of
a Hero, a Hero in the last Age will be a Heroin
this - Tho' the Natures of Virtue or Vice
cannot be changed, replied the Countess, yet
they may le mistaken ; and different Principles,
Customs, and Education, may probably'
change their Names, if not their Natures.

Sure, Madam, said Arabella a little moved,
you do net intend by this Inference to prove
Oroondates, Artaxerxes, Juba, Artaban, andthle
other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Mtn ?

Judging them by the Rules of Christianity,
and our present Notions of Honour, Justice,
and Humanity, they certainly are, replied the
Counters.

Did they not possess all the necessary Qualifications
of Heroes, Madam, said Arabella, and
e; ch in a superlative Degree - Was not their
Valour invincible, their Generosity unbounded,
and their Fidelity inviolable ?

It cannot be denied, said the Countess, but
that their Valour was invincible ; and many
thousand Men less courageous than themselves,

felt the fatal Effets of that invincible Valour,
which was perpetually seeking after Occasions
to exert itself. Oroondates gave many extraordinary
Proofs of that unbounded Generosity so
natural to the Heroes of his Time. This Prince
being sent by the King his Father, at the Head
of an Army, to oppose the Pci'an Monarch,
who had unjustly invaded his Dominions, and
was destroying the Lives and Properties of his
Subject; having taken the Wives and Daughters
of his Enemy Printers, had by these Means
an, Opportunity to put a Period to a War so
destructive to his Country: Yet out of a generosity
truly heroick, he releas'd them immediately
without any Conditions; and falling in
Love with one of those Princesses, secretly
quitted his Father's Court, resided several Years
ip that of the Enemy of his Father and Country,
engage'. himself to his Daughter, and when
the War broke out again between the two
Kings, fought furiously against an Army in
which the King his Father was in Person, and
shed the Blood of his future Subject without
Remorse; tho' each of three Subjects, we are
told, would have sacrificed his Life to save that
of. their Prince, so much was he belov'd,
Such are the Actions which immortalize the
Heroes of Romance, and are by the Authors
of those Books styl'd glorious, godlike, and divine.
Yet judging of them as Christians, we
shall find them impious and base, and directly
opposite to our present Notions of moral and relative
Duties.

'Tis certain therefore, Madam, added the
Contes with a Smile, that what was Virtue in

those Days, is Vice in ours * And to form a
Hero according to our Notions of 'em at present,
'tis nectary to give him Qualities very different
from 0. oindlates.

The secret Charm in the Countenance, Voice,
and Manner of the Countess, join'd to the
Force of her reasoning, could not fail of making
some Impression on the Mind of Arabella;
but it was such an Impression as came far short
of Conviction. She was surprized, embarrassed,
perplexed, but not corn inc'd. Heroism, romantick
Heroism, was deeply rooted in her Hca t;
it was her Habit of thinking, a Principle imbib'd
from Education. She could not separate
her Ideas of Glory, Virtue, Curage, Generosity,
and Honour, from the false Representations
of them in the Actions of Oroonlmats,
.7tba, Artaxerxes, and the rest of the imagina y
Heroes. The Countess's Discourse had rais'd a
Kind of Tumult in her Thoughts, which gave
an Air of Perplexity to her lovely Face, and
made that Lady apprehensive She had gone too
far, and lost that Ground in her Esteem, which
(he had endeavour'd to acquire by a Conformity
to some of her Notions and Language. I, this
however, file was mistaken; Arabella felt a
Tenderness for her that had already the Force of
a long contracted Friendship, and an Esteem
little Its than Veneration.

When the Countess took Leave, the Professions
of Arabella, tho' deliver'd in the Language
of Romance, were very sincere and affecting,
and were return'd with an equal Degree of
Tenderness by the Countess, who had conceiv'd
a more than ordinary Affection for her.

Mr. Glanville who could have alios worshiped
the Countess for the generous Design he
saw (he had lntertaili'd, took an. Opportunity
as he halted her to her Chair, tu intreat in a
Manner as earnestly as polite, th:it (he wtcil.i
continue the Happiness ot her Acquaintance i
his Cousin; which with a Smile of milgl¬¢j
Dignity and Sweetness (he affixed him of.

C HAP . VIII.
Which concludes Book the Eighth.
R. Glanville at his Return to the Diningroom,
finding Arabella retir'd, told his
Father in a Rapture of Joy, that the charming
Countess would certainly make a Convert of
Lady Bella.

Methinks, said the Baronet, fie has as strange
'Whims in her Head as my Niece. Adds-heart,
what a deal of Stuff did (he talk about ! A
Parcel of Heroes as (he calls them, with confounded
hard Names-In my Mind (he is more
likely to make Lady Bel a worse than better.

Mr. Glanville, a little vcx'd at his Father's
Mis-apprehension, endeavour'd with as much
Delicacy ashe could, to let him right with Regard
to the Countess; so that he brought him
at last to conies (he manag'd the Thing very
well

The Countess, who had resolv'd to take
Arabella openly into her Protection, was thinking
on Means to engage her to appear at the

Vo l,. JI M Assembly,

Assembly, whither file propos'd to accompany
her in a modern Drcfs. But her good Intentions
towards our lovely Heroine were suspended
by the Account file receiv'd of her Mother's
Indisposition, which commanded her immediate
Attendance on her at her Seat in-her

sudden Departure gave Arabella an extreme
Uneasiness and proved a cruel Disappointment
to Mr. Granville, who had founded
all his Hopes of her Recovery on the Conversation
of that Lady.

Sir Charles having Affairs that required his
Presence in London, propos'd to his Niece the
leaving Bath in a Ikw Days, to which file contented
; and accordingly they lft out for London
in arabella's Coach and Six, attended by
several Servants on Horseback, her Women
having been sent away before in the Stage.

Nothing very remarkable happen'd during
this Journey, so we (hall not trouble our Readers
with several finally Mistakes of Arabella's,
such as her supposing a neat Country Girl who
was riding behind a Man, to be some Lady or
Princess in Disguise, forc'd away by a Lover
the hated, and intreating M/r. Glanville to attempt
her Rescue; which occasioned some
little Debate between her and Sir Charles, who
could not be persuaded to believe it was as flie
said, and forbid his Son to meddle in other
Peoples Affairs. Several of these Sort of mistakes,
as we said before, we omit, and will
therefore if our Reader pleases, bring our Hc-
i'inc without further Delay to London.

.VI which is related an admirable Ad.

I S S Glanville whose Spirits were
greatly exhilarated at their Entrance
into London, that Seat of
magnificence and Pleasure, congratulated
her Cousin upon the
Entertainment Ihe would receive from the new
and surprizing Objects which every Day for a
considerable Time would fuilnifli her with; and
ran over the Catalogue of Diversions with filch
a Volubility of Tongue, as drew a gentle Reprimand
from her Father, and made her keep
a sullen Silence fill they were set down in

M 2 St. Jawsl('^

St. Jane's Square, the Place of their Residence
in Town.

Sir Charles having order'd his late Lady's
Apartment to be prepar'd for the Accommodation
of his Niece; as soon as the sift Civilities
were over, she retired to her Clamber, where
The employed herflif in giving her Women directions
for placing leer Books, of which she
had brought a moderate Quantity to London, in
her Closet.

Miss Glinville as soon as she had dispatched
away tome hundred Cards to her Acquaintance,
to give them Notice she was in Town, attended
ilrablla in her own Apartment; and as they
sat at the Tea file begun to regulate the Diversions
of the Week, naming the Drawing-room,
Park, Concert, Ranelagh, Lady - assembly,
the Dutchess of Rant, [aux-Hall, and
a hon, &c. of Visits ; at which Arabella, with
an Accent that expressed leer Surprize ask'd
her, It she supposed she intended to slay in
Town three or four Years-law,

Cousin, said Miss Glanville, all this is
but the Anufemncnt of a few Days.

Amusement, do you say, replied Araabtla,
methinks it seems to be the fuse Employment of
thorn Days: And what you call the Amuses
must of Necessity be the Business of Life.
You are always so grave, Cousin, said Mils
Glanville, one does not know what to say to
you. However, I (can't press you to go to
*Publick Placesagainft your Inclination, yetyou'il
condescend to receive a few Visits, I pfuppoli ?.

Yes, replied Arabella, and if among the Ladies
wlhm I shall see, I find any lice the-amiable

Countess of - , I stall not scruple to
enter into the most tender Amity with them.

The Countess of is very well, to be fur,
said Miss Glanville, yet I don't know how it is,
fie does not suit my Taste - She is very particular
in a great many Things, and knows too
much for a I,:.dy, as I heard my Lord Fribble
say one )ay : Then she is quite unfashionable:
She hates Cards, keeps no Assembly, is seen but
seldom at Publick Places; and in my Opinion,
as well as in a great many others, is the dullest
Company in the World. I'm sure I met herat
a Visit a little before I went down to your
Stat, and (he bas not been a quarter of an Hour
in the R hom, before (he set a whole Circle of
Ladies a yawning.

Arabella, the' (he had a sincere Contempt for
her Cousin's Manner of thinking, yet always
politely conceal'd it; and vex'd as she was at
her Sneers upon the Countess, she contented
herself with gently defending her, telling her at
the same Time, that till she met with a Lady
who had more Merit than the Countess possessed,
she should always possess the first Place
in her Esteem.

Arabella, who had from Youth adopted
the Resentments of her Father, refus'd to make
her Appearance at Court, which Sir Charles
gently intimated to her; yet being not wholly
divested of the. Curiosity natural to her Sex, she
condescended to go incog. to the Gallery on a
Bit Night, accompanied by Mr. Glanville and
his Sister, in order to behold the Splendor of the
British Court.

M 3 As

As her Romances had long familiariz'd her
Thoughts to Objects of Grandeur and Magnificence,
the was not so much struck as might
have been expected, with those that now presented
themselves to her View. Nor was shea
little disappointed to find that among the Men
she saw none whose Appearance came up to her
Ideas of the Air and Port of an .ltabali, Ordinates,
or 7ulba ; or any of the Ladies, who did
not in her Opinion, fall short of the Perfections
of Eliza, Mandate, Santa, &c. 'Twas remarkable
too, that she never enquir'd how often
the Princesses had been carried away by captivated
Monarchs, or how many Victories the
King's Sons had gain'd ; but seemed the whole
Time (he was there to have suspended all her
Romantick Ideas of Glory, Beauty, Gallantry,
and Love.

Mr. Glanville was highly pleas'd with her
composed Behaviour, and a Day or two after
intreated her to allow him the Honour of shewing
her what was remarkable and worthy of her
Observations this great Metropolis. To this
flie also consented, and for the greater Privacy
began their Travels in a hir'd Coach.
- Part of several Days were taken up in this
Employment; but Mr. Glanville had the Mortification
to find she was full of Allusions to her
Romances upon every Occasion, such as her
asking the Person who shews the Armoury at
theTou.er, the Names of the Knights to whom
each Suit belong'd, and wondering there were no
.Devices on the Shields or Plumes of Feathers
in the Helmets: Sheobferv'd that.the Lyon Lys
J
kill'd, was according to the History of

that Prince, much larger than any of those the
was shew'd in the Tower, and also much fiercer.
Took Notice that St. Paul's was lets magnificent
in the Inside, than the 'Temple in which
G,,;-t, when he went to Mandana,I heard her
etiirn Thanks for his supposed Death: Enquir'd
if it was not customary for the King and
his whole Court to fail in Barges upon the
7anm,',, as Ilfigt/yqts used to do upon the 'Tiber,
whether they had not Musick and Collations
in the Park, and where they celebrated the Just
and Tournaments.

The Season for Feux-hall being not yet over,
the was desirous of once seeing a Place, which
by the Description (he had heard of it, greatly
resembled the Gardens of Lucullus at Rome, in
which the Emperor, with all the Princes and
Pi increases of his Court were so nobly entertain'd,
and where so many gallant Conversations had
pass'd among those admirable Persons.

The Singularity of her Drcfs, for (he was
cover'd with her Veil, drew a Number of
Gazers after her, who prest round her with so
little Respect, that she was greatly embarrassed,
and had Thoughts of quitting the Place, delightful
as (he own'd it, immediately, when her
Attention was wholly engrossed by an Adventure
in which (he soon interested herself very
deeply.

An Officer of Rank in the Sea Service had
brought his Mistress disguised in a Suit of Man's
wr rather Boy's Cloaths, and a Hat and weather,
into the Gardens. The young Creature
being a little intoxicated with the Wine she had
taken-:to-freely, was thrown so much osier

M 4 Guard

Guard as to give Occ:fi n to tome of the Company
to suspect her Sex ; and a gay Fill, in
order to give them rome Diversion at her Expence,
pretending to be affronted'at f meeting
she said, drew his Sword upon the disguised Fair
One, which so a'arm''d ;cr, that she (shrieked
out, She was a Wronlap, and ran. for Protection
to her Lover,who was so dis rdei'd with Liquor,
that he was not all. to defend her.

Miss Glanville ever curious and inquisitive,
demanded the Cause why the Company ran in
Clouds to that particular Spot and received
for Answer, That a Gentleman had drawn his
Sword upon a Lady disguised in a Man's Habit.

Oh Heav'ns ! cry'd Arabella, this must certainly
be a very notable Adventure. The Lady
hasdoubtltfs some extraordinary Circumstances
in leer Story, and haply upon Enquiry, her Misfortunes
will be found to resemble those which
oblig'd the beautiful AfpJria to put on the same
Disguise, who was by that Means murder'd by
the cruel ZEnodorus in a Fit of Jealousy at the
Amity his Wife exprest for her. But can I
not see: this unfortunate Fair One, added (le,
pressing' inspire of Mr. Glanville's 'Entreaties
throstle Croud-I may haply be able to afford
her some Copulation. '

Mr. Glanville finding his Persuasions were
not regarded, follow'd her with very little Difficulty:
For her Veil 'falling back in hetHurry,
Ihe did not mind to replace it, and the Charms
of her Face, join'd to/theMajcity of herPier-
son'; aid' 'Singularity of hier Dares, :altrtiHng.
every Pegons's Attention ani'Refipe&, ;they
made Way sot her to'pa4, iot a ittltirpti'd

at the extreme Earnestness and Solemnity that
appear'd. in her Countenance upon an Event so
diverting to every one else.

The disguised Lady whom [he was endeavouring
to approach, had thrown herself upon
a Bench in one of the Boxes, trembling still
with the Apprehension of the Sword, tho' her
Antagonist was kneeling at her Feet, making
Love to her in Mock-Heroicks for the Diversion
of the Company.

Her Hat and Peruke had fallen off in her
Fright, and her Hair which had been turn'd
up under it, hung now loosely about her Neck,
and gave such an Appearance of Woe to a Face,
which notwithstanding the Paleness that Terror
had overspread it with, was really extremely
pretty, that Arabella was equally struck with
Compassion and Admiration of her.

Lovely Unknown, said [he to her with an
Air of extreme Tenderness, tho' I am a Stranger
both to your Name and Hifiory, yet your
Aspen persuading me your Quality is not mean,
and the Condition and Disguise: in which I behold
you, (hewing that you are unfortunate, permit
me to offer you all theAfifianc:s in my Power,
seeing that I am mov'd thereto by my compassion
for your Distress, and that Esteem which
the Sight of you must necessarily inspire.

Mr. Glanville was struck dumb with Confusion
at this firangeSpeech, and at theWhifpers
and Scoffs it occasioned among the Spectators. He
attempted to take hold of her Hand in order to
lead her away, but the disengaged les. If from
himni with ~ Frown of Displeasure ; and taking
no Notice: of Mi, Glanville, who whispered

M' ' vM,'witi

with great Emotion, Lord, Cousin, how you
expose yourself ! prest nearer to the Beautiful
Disguised, and again repeated her Offers of
Service.

The Girl being perfectly recover'd from her
Intoxication by the Fright Ihe had been in, gaz'd
upon Arabella with a Look of extreme Surprize:
Yet being mov'd to refute by the Dignity
of her Appearance, and strange as her
Words seemed to be by the obliging Purports
them,, and the asserting Earnestness with which
they were deliver'd, she rose from her Seat and
thanked her, with an Accent full of Regard
and Submission.

Fair Maid, said Arabella, taking her Hand,
let us quit this Place, where your Discovery
may probably subject you to more Dangers: If
you willie pleas'd to put yourself into my Protein,
and acquaint me with the History of
your Misfortunes; I have Interest enough with
a valiant Pers n who shall undertake to free you
Loi your Persecutions, and re-establish the
Repose of your Life.

The kneeling Hero, who as well as everyone
else that were present, had gaz'd with Aston
at Arabella during all this Passage,
;perceiviihghe was about to rob him of the disguised
Fair, seiz'd hold of the Hand the had at
Liberty, and swore he would not part with her.

Mr. Glanville almost mad. with Vexation,
endeavour'd to get Arabella away.

Are you mad, Madam,. said he in a Whisper,
to make all this Rout about a. Prostitute ? Do
you see how every body flares at-you ? What
will they think - For Heav'ns sake let us be
1 . . 1 What,.

What, Sir, replied Arabella in a Rage, Are
you base enough to leave this admirable Creature
in the Power of that Ma,. who is questionless
her Ravisher; and will you not draw
your Sword in her Defence ?

Hey day ! cry'd the Sea-officer, wak'd out of
his stupidest by the Clamour about him:What's
the Matter here-What are you doing? Where's
my Lucy ? Moons I Sir,. said he to the young
Fellow who held her, What Business have you
with my Lucy ? And uttering a dreadful Oath,
drew out his Sword, and staggered towards his
gay Rival, who observing the Weakness of his
Antagonist, flourished with his Sword to shew
his Courage and frighten the Ladies,. who all
ran away screaming. Arabella taking Miss
Glanville under the Arm, cried out. to Mr.
Glanville as she left the Place, to take Care of'
the digressed Lady, and while the two Combatants
were disputing for her, to carry her away
in Safety.

But Mr. Glanville without regarding this Injunction,
hastened after her ; and to pacify her,.
told her the Lady was rescu'd by her favourite
Lover, and carry'd off in Triumph,

But are you sure, said Arabella, it was not
some other of her Ravishers who carry'd her
away, and not the Person whom the hashaply
favour'd with her Affecion ? May not the same
Thing have happen'd to her, as did to the beautiful
Candace, Queen of Ethiopia ; who while
two of her Ravishers were fighting forever, a
third whom she took for her Deliverer, came
and carry'd her away

But she went away willingly, I assure you,
Madam, said Mr. Glanville: Pray don't be in
any Concern about her-sis

(he went away willingly with him, rep!y'd
Arabella, 'tis probable, it. may not be, another
Ravisher: And.yet if.this Perfun that rescu'd
her happen'd to be in Armour, and the Vizor
of his Helmet down, the might be mistaken as
well as Queen Candace.

Well, well, he was not in Armour, .Madam
said Glanville almost beside hirmflf withVexation
at her Folly.

You seen to be disturbed, Sir, said Arabella
a little surprized at his peevish Tone: Is there
any Thing in this Adventure which concerns
you ? Nay, now I remember, you did not offer
to defend the Beautiful Unknown. I am
no;. willing to impute your In-aston upon such
an occasion, to Want of Courage or Generosity;
perhaps you are acquainted with her history,
and from this Knowledge refus'd to engage
in her Defence.

Mr. Glanville perceiving the Company gather
from all Parts to the Walk they were in, told
her he would acquaint her with all he knew
concerning the disguised Lady when they were
in the Coach on their return Home; and arabella
impatient for the promis'd Story, propos'd
to leave the Gardens immediately, which was
gladly comply'd with by Mr. Glanville, who
heartily repented his having carry'd her thither.

.¬∑ id CHAP.

CHA P., IL
Which ends with a .very unfavourable

oar Heroine.
AS soon as they wre seated in the Coach she
did not fail to call upon him to perform
his Promise: But Mr. Glanville, excessively out
of Humour at her exposing herself in the Gardens,
reply'd, without considering whether he
should not offend her, That he knew no more
of the disguised Lady than any body elf; in the
Place.

How, Sir, reply'd Arabella, Did you not
promise to relate her Adventures to me? And
would you have me believe you knew no more
of them than the reit of the Cavaliers and Ladies
in the Place ?

Upon my Soul, I don't, Madam, said Glanville
; yet what I know of her is sufficient tolet
me understand she was not worth the consideration
you seemed to have for her.

She cannot sure be more indiscreet than the
fair and unfortunate Genuine, reply'd Arabella;
who like her put on Man's Apparel, through
Despair at the ill Success of her Passion for Alex-underhand
certain it is, that tho' the beautiful
Heroine was guilty of one gC eat Error which
lost her the Esteem of Alexander, yet she had a
high and noble Soul ; as was maniift by her
Behaviour and Words when she was run thro'
by the Sword of Demerits. Oh! Death, cry'd
she, as Ihe was falling, how sweet do I find

thee, and how much and how earnestly have I
desired thee!

Oh Lord! oh Lord! cry'd Mr. Glanville
hardly sensible of what he said, Was there ever
.ny Thing )b intolerable? *-

Do you pity the unhappy Hermit, Sir? said
Arabella interpreting his Exclamation her own
Way ? Indeed she is well worthy of your Compassion.
And if the bare Recital of-the Words
the utter'd at receiving her Death's Wound assets
you so much, you may guess what would
have been your Agonies, had you been Deme-tries
that gave it to her.

Here Mr. Glanville groaning aloud thro' Impatience
at her Absurdities. .

This Subject asses you deeply, I perceive,
said Isabella. There is no Question but you
would have aged in the same Circumstance, as
Demerits did: Yet let me tell you, the Extravagancy
of his Rage and Despair for what
he had innocently committed, was imputed to
him as a great Imbecility, as was also the violent
Passion he conceiv'd soon after for the Fair
De;daamia. You know the Accident which
brought that fair Princess into his Way.

Indeed, I do not, Madam, said Glanville
peevishly.

Well, then I'll tell yoi, said Arabella, but
pausing a little:

The Recital I have engag'd myself to make,.
added she, will necessarily take up some Hours
Time, as upon Reflexion I have found: So if
you will dispense with my beginning it at present,
I will satisfy your Curiosity To-morrow,,
when I may be able to pursue it without interruption,.
To

To this Mr. Glanville made no other answer
than a Bow with his Head; and the Coach
a few Moments after arriving at their own
House, he led her to her Apartment, firmly
resolv'd never to attend her to any more Publick
Places while she continued in the same ridiculous
Folly.

Sir Charles, who had several Times been in
doubt whether Arabella was not really disordered
in her Senses; upon Miss Glanville's Account
of her Behaviour at the Gardens, concluded
she was absolutely mad, and held a (short Debate
with himself, Whether he ought not to bring
commission of Lunacy against her, rather
than marry her to his Son, whom he was persuaded
could never be happy with a Wife so unaccountably
absurd. Tho' he only hinted at
this to Mr. Glanville, in a Conversation he had
with him while his Dissatisfaction was at its
Height, concerning Arabella, yet the bare Supposition
that his Father ever thought of such a
Thing, threw the young Gentleman into such
Agonies, that Sir Charles to compose him, protested
he would do nothing in relation to his
Niece that he would not approve of. Yet he
expostulated with him on the Absurdity of her
Behaviour, and the Ridicule to which she expos'd
herself wherever she went; appealing to
him, whether in a Wife he could think those
Follies supportable, which in a Mistress occasioned
him so mulch Confusion.

Mr. Glanville, as much in Love as he was,
felt all the Force of this Inference, and acknowledg'd
to his Father, That he could not think
of ' carrying Arabella till the Whims her Romances

had put into her Head, were erased by
a better Knowledge of Life and Manners. Bit
he added with a Sigh, That he knew not how
this Reformation would be effected; for the
had such a strange Facility in reconciling every
Incident to her own fantaftick Ideas, that every
new Object added Strength to the fatal Deception
she laboured under.

In which Arabella meets with another

OaU R lovely Heroine had not been above a

j Fortnight in London, before the gross Air
of that smoaky Town affected her Health so
much, that Sir Charles propos'd to her to go fora
few Weeks to Richmond, where he hir'd a
House elegantly furnished for her Reception.

Miss Glanville had been too long out of that
darling City, to pay her the Compliment of attending
her constantly at Richmond; yet The
promis'd to be soften as possible with her: And
Sir Charles, having Affairs that could not dispense
with his Absence from Town, plac'd his
Steward in her House, being a Perfun whose
Prudence and Fidelity he could rely upon; and
he, with her Women, and two or three other
menial Servants, made up her Equipage.

As it was not consistent with Decorum for
Mr. Glanville to reside-in her House, he contented
himself with riding to Ribbing generally,*

-.*- **' ,every

every Day: And as long as Arabella was pleas'd
with that Retirement, he resolv'd not to
press her Return to Town till the Counters
of arriv'd, in whose Conversation he
grounded all his Hopes of her Cure.

At that Season of the Year Richmond not
being quite deserted by Company, Arabella was
visited by several Ladies of Fashion; who
charm'd with her Affability, Politeness, and
good Sense, were strangely perplex'd how to account
for some Peculiarities in her Dress and
Manner of thinking.
Some of the younger Sort from whom arabella's
extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretensions
to Equality on that Score, made themselves extremely
merry with herOJdneffes, as they call'd
them, and gave broad Intimations that her
Head .was not right.

As, for Arabella, whose Taste was as delicate,
Sentiments as refin'd, and Judgment as clear as
any Person's could be who believ'd the Authenticity
of Scudery's Romances, the was strangely
disappointed to find no Lady with whom (he
could converse with any tolerable Pleasure: And
that instead of Clelia's, Statira's, ,landing's, &c.
Ihe sound only Miss Glanville among all (he
knew.

The. Comparison Ihe drew between such as
these and the charming Countess of-whom
(he had just begun to be acquainted with at Bath,
increas'd her Regret for the Interruption that
was given to so agreeable a Friendship: And it
was with infinite Pleasure Mr. Glanville heard
her repeatedly wish for the Arrival of that admirable
Lady (as dli always called her) in Town.

Not being able to relish the insipid Conversation
of the young Ladies that visited her at
Richmond, her chief Amusements to walk in
the Park there; which because of its Rural Privacy,
was extremely agreeable to her Inclinations.

Here (he indulg'd Contemplation, leaning on
the Arm of her faithful Lucy, while her other
Women walk'd at some Distance behind her, and
two Men Servants kept her always in Sight.

One Evening when (he was returning from
her usual Walk, she heard the Sound of a Woman's
Voice, which seemed to proceed from a
Tuft of Trees that hid her from her View.
And slopping a Moment, distinguished some
plaintive Accents, which increasing her curiosity,
she advanc'd towards the Place, telling
Lucy, (he was resolv'd if possible to discover
who the distressed Lady was, and what was the
Subject of her Afflition.

As Ihe drew nearer with softly treading Steps,
the could distinguish through the Branches of
the Trees, now despoiled of great part of their
Leaves, two Women seated on the Ground,
their Backs towards her, and one of them with
her Head gently reclin'd on the other's Shoulder,
seemed by her mournful Action to be weeping ;
for the often put her Handkerchief to her Eyes,
breathing every Time a Sigh, which, as Arabella
phrased it, seemed to proceed from the deepens
Recesses of her Heart.

This Adventure, more worthy indeed to be
fyl'd an Adventure than all our Fair Heroine
had ever yet met with, and so conformable to
what (he had read in Romances, fill'd her Heart
with eager Expectation. She made a Sign to

Lucy to make no Noise, and creeping till closer
towards the Place where this afflicted Person
fat, fie heard her distinctly utter these Words,
which however were often interrupted with her
Sighs.

Ah ! ,riaaenes, whom I to my Misfortune
have too much loved, and whom to my Misfortune
I fear I (hall never sufficiently hate,
since that Heav'n and thy cruel Ingratitude hath
ordain'd that thou shalt never be mine, and that
ib many sweet and dear Hopes are for ever
taken from me, return me at least, ungrateful
Man, return me those Testimonies of my innocent
Affection, which were sometimes so
dear and precious to thee. Return me those
Favours, which all innocent as they were, are
become Criminal by thy Crime. Return me,
Cruel Man, return me those Reliques of my
Heart which thou detained in Delight of me,
and which, notwithstanding thy Infidelity, I
cannot recover.

Here her Tears interrupting her Speech,
Arabella being impatient to know the History
of this afflicted Person, came softly round to
the other Side, and (hewing herself, occasioned
fonte Disturbance to the sad Unknown ; who
rising from her Seat, with her Face averted, as
if ashamed of having so far disclosed her Sorrows
in a Stranger's Hearing, endeavour'd to
pass by her un-notic'd.

Arabella perceiving her Design, ffop'd her
with a very graceful Action, and with a Voice
all compos'd of Sweetness, earnestly conjur'd
her to relate her Hifiory.

Think not, Lovely Unknown, said the (for
Ihe was really very pretty) that my Endeavours
to detain you proceed from an indiscreet curiosity.
'Tis true, some Complaints which I1:av
fallen from your fair Mouth, have rais'd in mi a
Desire to be acquainted with your Adventures;
but this Desire has its Foundation in that Cam-paoli
n your Complaints have fill'd me with:
And if I with to know your Misfortunes,
'tis only with a View of affording you sunt
Consolation.

Pardon me, Madam, said the Fair Afflicted,
gazing on Arabella with many Signs of Admiration,
if my Confusion at being over-heard
in a Place I had chosen to bewail my Misfortunes,
made me be guilty of some Appearance
of Rudeness, not seeing the admirable Person I
wanted to avoid. But purified (he, hesitating
a little, those Characters of Beauty I behold in
your Face, and the Gracefulness of your Deportment
convincing me you can be of no r-
diary Rank, I will the less scruple to acquaint
you with my Adventures, and the Cause of
those Complaints you have heard proceed from
my Mouth.

Arabella assuring her, that whatever her Misfortunes
were, the might depend upon all the
Assistance in her Power, f acted herself near herat
the Foot of the Tree where the had been sitting,
and giving Lucy Orders to join the rest of
her Women, and slay at a Distance till she
made a Sign to them to advance, she prepar'd
to listen to the Adventures of the Fair
Unknown, who after some little Pause, began
to relate them in this Manner.

CHAP. IV.
It which is related the HiJfoYy of the

Princess of Gaul.
'/Y Name, Madam, is Cynthia, my Birth
M.N1 Illustrious enough, Seing that I am the
Daughter of a Sovereign Prince, who pofilidts
a large and spacious Territory in what is new
called Antient Gaze.

What, Madam, interrupted Arae!ita, Are
you a Princess then ?

Questionless I am, Madam, replied the Lady;
and a Princess happy and prosperous, iii
the Felicity of my Life was interrupted by the
perfidious Marianne's.

Pardon me, Madam, interrupted Arabella
again, that my Ignorance of your Quality
made me be deficient in those Respect which
are due to your high Birth, and which notwithstanding
those Characters of Greatness I might
read in the Lineaments of your Visage, I vet
neg'et. d to p my-alas!

Madam, said the Stranger, that little
Beauty which the Heavens bestowed on me
only to make me wretched, as by the Event it
has proved, has long since taken its Flight, and
together. with my Happiness, I have lost that
which made me Unhappy. And certain it is,
Grief has made such Ravages among what might
once. have been thought tolerable in my Face,
that 1 hould not be. surprized if my being no
longer Fair, should make you with Difficulty
believe I ever was so.

D

Arabella after a proper Compliment in answer
to this Speech, intreated the Princess to goon
with her History, who hesitating a little,
comply'd with her Request.

Be pleased to know then, Madam, said she,
that being bred up with all imaginable Tenderness
in my Father's Court, I had no sooner
arriv'd to my Sixteenth Year than I saw myself
surrounded with Lovers; who ne erthelces,
such was the Severity with which I behaves
myself, conceal'd their Parsons under a respectful
Silence, well knowing BJnifllient from mv
Presence was the least Punishment they had to
expect, if they presumed to declare their Sentiments
to me.

I liv'd in this Fashion, Madam, for Two
Years longer, rejoicing in the Insensibility of
my own Heart, and triumphing in tt.e Sufferings
of others, when my Tranquillity was all
at once interrupted by an Accident which I amen
going to relate to you.

The Princess stopt here to give Vent to some
Sighs which a cruel Remembrance forc'd from
her; and continuing in a deep louse for five
or six Minutes, resumed her Story in this
Manner.

It being my Custom to walk in a Forest
adjoining to one of my Father's Summer
Residences, attended only by my Women,
one Day when I was taking this Amusement,
I perceiv'd at some Distance a Man lying
on the Ground ; and impelled by a sudden
Curiosity, Advanced towards this Person, whom
upon a nearer View I perceiv'd to have been
wounded very much, and fainted away through

Loss of Blood. His Habit being very rich, I
concluded by that he was of n io
mean Quality:
But when I had look'd upon his Countenance,
pale and languishing as it was, methought there
appear'd io many Marks of Greatness, accompany'd
with a Sweetness so happily blended, that
my Attention was engaged in an extraordinary
Manner, and interested me so powerfully in his
Safety, that I commanded fume of my Women
to run immediately for proper Assistance, and
convey him to the Castle, while I directed
others to throw rome Water in his Face, and
to apply some Linen to his Wounds, to flop
the Bleeding.

These charitable Cares restored the wounded
Stranger to his Senses; he open'd his Eyes, and
turning them slowly to the Objects around him,
six'd at last their languishing Looks on me:
When mov'd, as itflould seem, to some Refpet
by what he saw in my Countenance, he rose
with fume Difficulty from the Ground, and
bowing almost down to it again, by that Ation
seemed to pay me his Acknowledgments for what
he supposed I had done for his Preservation.

His extreme Weakness having oblig'd him to
creep towards a Tree, against the Back of which
he supported himself, I went nearer to him, and
haying told him the Condition in which 1 found
him, and the Orders I had dispatched for Assistance,
requested him to acquaint me with his
Name and Quality, and the Adventure which
had brought him into that Condition.

My Name, Madam, answered he, is Ailments,
my Birth is Noble enough ; I have spent
some Years in my Travels, and was returning

to my nati'. Country, when passing thro' this
Forest I was lziz'd with an Inclination to keep.
I had ty'd my Horse to agree, and retiring
some few Paces off, stretched myself at the Foot
of a large Oak whose Branches promis'd mean
agreeable Share. I had not yet clos'd my Eyes,
when the Slunlbir I invited was dissipated by
the Sound of same Voices near me.

A Curiosity, rot natural to me, made m-
listen to the Discourse of these Persons, whom vw
the Tone of their Voices, tho' I could not si
them, I knew to be Men.

In short, Madam, I Wds a Witness to a moll
horrible Scheme which they concerted together;
my Weakness will not permit me to enter indian
exam Detail of all I heard : The Result c i
their Conference w.S, To seize the Princess ot
this Country and carry her off.

Here, pursued Cynthia, I interrupted the
Stranger with a loud Cry, which giving him
to understand who I was, he apologized in the
most graceful Manner imaginable for the little
Respect he had hitherto p.idl me.

I then intreated him to tell me, If he had any
Opportunity of hearing the Name of my defijn'J
Ravilher; to which he reply'd, that he understood
it to be Slander.

This Man, Madam, was one of my Father's
Favourites, and had been long secretly in Love
with me.

Ariamenes then inform'd me, that being enflam'd
with Rage against these impious Villains,
he rose from the Ground, re-mounted his Porte,
and defy'd the two Traytors aloud, threatning
them with Death, unless they abandon'd their
impious Design. 'attainder

Slander made no Answer, but rufli'd furiously
upon him, and had the Business to fi'cr
his wicked Associate to assist hin: But tlth valiant
/riamencs, tho' he 1i) ke modestly of his
Victory, yet gave me to understand that he had
made both the villains abandon their wicked Enterprize,
with their Lives; and that dilinouRt-
ing in order to see if they were quite dead, lie
found himself so faint with the Wounds he had
received from them both, that he had not
Strength to re-mount his Horse ; but crawling'
on, in hopes of meeting with some Afliflalc;,
fainted away at last through Weariness and I,,)f
of Blood.

While he was giving me this Account, the
Chariot I had sent for arrived, and having mad'
iihn such Acknowledgments as tie Obligation
I had received from him demanded, I caus'd
him to get into the Chariot, and sending one
with him to acquaint the Prince my Father
all that had happen'd, and the Merit (or
the valiant Stranger, I returned the same Way
I came with my Women, my Thoughts being
wholly engrossed by this Unknown.

The Service he had done me fill'd me with a
Gratitude and Esteem for him, which prepared
my Heart for those tender Sentiments I afterwards
entertained to the Ruin of my Repose.

I will not tire your Patience, Madam, with
a minute Detail of all the succeeding Paflg-.s;
of my Story; it shall suffice to tell you, Tit
Armaments was received with extraordir:,n;!
Marks of Esteem by my Father; that his CG lc
was soon compleated ; and that having vow'.
himself to my Service, and declared n i:nai-

VOL. II. N , enable

tenable Passion for me, I permitted him to love
me, and gave him that Share in my Heart,
which I fear not all his Infidelities will ever deprive
him of.

His Attachment to me was soon surfeited by
Slander's Relations, who having secretly
vow'd his Ruin, endeavour'd to discover if I
had admitted his Address, and having made
themselves Masters of our Secrets, by means of
the Treachery of one ofmiy Women, procur'd
Information to be given to my Father of our
mutual Pafion.

Alas ! what Mischiefs did not this fatal Discovery
produce: My Father, enrag'd to the
last Degree at this Intelligence, confin'd me to
my Apartments, and order'd Ar sameness to leave
his Dominions within three Days.

Spare me, Madam, the Repetition of what
pass'd at our last sad Interview, which by large
Bribes to my Guards, he obtain'd.

His Tears, his Agonies, his Vows of everlasting
Fidelity, so soothed my Melancholy at
parting with him, and persuaded me of his
Constancy, that I waited for several Months
with perfect Tranquillity for the Performance
of the Promis ie made me, to do my Father
rich considerable Services in the War he was
engag'd'inwith one of his Neighbours, should
oblige him to give me to him for his Reward.

But, alas ! two Years roll'd on without
bringing back the unfaithful Ariamenes. My
Father died, and my Brother who succeeded
him, being about to force me to marry a Prince
whom I detested, I secretly quitted the Courtyard
attended only by this faithful Confidant whom

you behold with me, and fume few of my truly
Doimefit.ks, I came hither in Search of Aria-menes,
he having told me this Country was the
Place of his Birth.

Paler, the most prudent and faithful of my
Servants, undertook to find out the ungrateful
Ariamenes, whom yet I was willing to find excuses
for, but all his Enquiries were to no esse
; the Name of ,Ainamcenes was not known
in this Part of the World.

I'ir'd out with unsuccessful Enquiries, I resolved
to seek out some obscure Place, where I
might in secret lament my Misfortunes, and
expect the End of them in Death. My Attendants
-found me out stich a Retreat as -I
wanted, in a neighbouring Village, which they
call 'Twickenham, I think, from whence I often
make Excursions to this Park, attended only as
you see; and here indulge myself in Complaints
upon the Cruelty of my Destiny.

The sorrowful Cynecia here ended her Story,
to which in the Course of her Relation fie had
given' a great many Interruptions through the
Violence of her Grief: And Arabella, after
having said every thing she could think on to
Affliction, earnestly intreated her to
accept of an Asylum at her House ; where she
(hould be treated with all the Respect due to
her illustrious Birth.

The afflicted Lady, tho' (he respectfully declin'd
this Offer, yet expressed great Desire of
commencing a staid Amity with our fair Heroine,
who on her Part, made her the most
tender Protestations of Friendship.

N z Sie

The Evening being alma clos'd, they parted
with great Reluctancy on both Sides; mutually
promising to meet in the same Place the next
Daw.

Clne'ia, having! enjoined her new Friend absolute
Secrecy, A.-all/a was under a Nec, flite
of keeping this Adventure to Herself. And tho'
he long', to tell Mr. Glanville, who came to
visit her the next Say, that the Countess was
extremely mistaken, when she maintain'd there
were no more wandering Princesses in the
World, yet the Engagement file had submitted
to, kept her silent.

CHA P. V.
A very glorious Chapter.
Isabella, who impatiently long'd for

the Hour of meeting the fair Princes,
with whom she was extremely delighted, consisted
her Watch so often, and discovered so
much Restlessness and Anxiety, that Mr. Glanville
began to be surprized; and the more, as
flie peremptorily commanded him not to attend
her in her Evening Walk. This Prohibition,
which, tho' he.durft not dispute, he secretly resolved
t., disobey; and as fun as flie set out for
the Park with her usual Attendants, he slipped
out by a Back-door,: and keeping her in his
Fight, himself unfeen,.:he. ventur'd to watch
her Motions.

As he had expelled to unravel some great
Mystery, he was agreeably disappointed to find
(he continu'd her Walk in the Park with great
Composure; and tho' she was soon join'd by the
imaginary Princess, yet conceiving her toe rome
young Lady, with whom (he had commenc'd an
Acquaintance at Richmond, his Heart was atRefi;
and for fear of displeasing her, he took a contrary
Path from that the was in, that he might
not meet her, yet resolv'd to slay till he thought
the would be inclin'd to return, and then shew
himself and c. nduat ter Home. A Solicitude
for which he did not imagine (he need be offended.


The two Ladies being met, after reciprocal
Compliments, the Princess intreated Arabella
to relate her Adventures ; who not being willing
to violate the Laws of Romance, which
require an unbounded Confidence upon there
Occasions, began very succinctly to recount the
History of her Life ; which, as (he manag'd
it, contain'd Events almost as Romantick and
Incredible as any in her Romances; winding
them up with a Confession that (he did not hate
Mr. Glanville, whom (he acknowledg'd to be
one of the most faithful and zealous of Lovers.

Cynecia with a Sigh, congratulated her upon
the Fidelity of a Lover, who by her Description,
was worthy the Place he possess'd in her
Esteem: And expressing a Wish, that (he could
see, unobserved by him, this gallant and generous
Person, Arabella, who that Moment espy'd
him at a Distance, yet advancing towards them,
told her, with a Blush that overspread all her
Face, That her Curiosity might be satisfied in

N 3 the

the Manner flie wish'd, for, yonder, added face
is the Person we have been talking of.

Cynecia, at there Words, looking towards
the Place where her fair Friend had directed ;
ito sooner cast her Eyes upon Mr. GlrNvlilk,
than giving a loud Cry, she sunk into the Arms
of Arabella, who, astonished and perplex'd as
she was, eagerly held them out to support her.

Finding her in a Swoon, the dispatch hed. Lucy,
who was near her, to look flr some Water to
throw in her Face ; but that Lady breathing a
deep Sigh, open'd her ]languishing Eyes, and fixing
a melancholy Look upon Arabella,

Ah! Madam, said she, wonder not at my
Affliction and Surprize, since in the Person of
your Lover I behold the ungrateful Ariamenes.

Oh Heav'ns ! my fair Princess, replied arabella,
What is it you say ? Is it possible Clan
vile can be Armaments P

He, cried the afflicted Princess with a disordered
Accent, He whom I now behold! and
*hom you call Glanville, was once Armaments,
she perjur'd, the ungrateful Ariamenes. Adieu,
Madam, I cannot bear this Sight ; I will hide
inyfelf from the World for ever ; nor need you
fess a Rival or an Enemy in the unfortunate
Cymia, who if possible, will cease to love the
unfaithful Ariamewes, and will never hate the
beautiful Arabella.

Saying this, without giving her Time to answer,
she took hold of her Confidant by the
Arm, and went away with so much Swiftness,
that she .was out of sight before Arabella was
enough recover'd from her Astonishment to be
able to intreat her Stay.

Our charming Heroine, ignorant till now of
the true State of her Heart, was surprized to
find it assaulted at once by all the Pavilions which
attend disappointed Love. Grief, Rage, Jealousy,
and Despair made f) cruel a War in her
gentle Bosom, that unable either to express or
to conceal the strong Emotions with which she
was agitated, (he gave Way to a violent Burst
of Tears, leaning her Head upon Lucy's Shoulder,
who wept as heartily as her Lady, tho' ignorant
of the Cause of her Filiation.

Mr. Glanville, who was now near enough
to take Notice of her Poflure, came running
with eager Heart to see what was the matter ;
when Arabella, rous'd from her Extacy of Grief
by the Sound of his Steps, lifted up her Head,
and seeing him approach,

Lucy, cried she, trembling with the Violence
of her Resentment, Tell that Traitor to keep
out of my Sight. Tell him, I forbid him ever
to appear before me again. And, tell him, added
she, with a Sigh that shook her whole
tender Frame, All the Blood in his Body is too
little to wash away his Guilt, or to pacify my
Indignation.

Then hastily turning away, she ran towards
her other Attendants, who were at some defiance;
and joining her Women, proceeded
directly Home.

Mr. Glanville, amaz'd at this Action, was
making after her as fast as he could, when Lucy
crossing in his Way, cry'd out to him to flop.

My Lady, said she, bid me tell you, Traitors
H

N 4 Hey

Hey d;iy ! intcniripted GCiavill, What the
Devil does the (girl mean ?

Pray Sir, said she, let me deliver my Message:
I stall forget if you speak to me till I
have laid it all-Stay, let me see, What cones
next ?

No more Traitor, I hope, said Glanville.
Nor, Sir, said Luc ; but there wjs something
about wailing in Blood, and you must
keep out of her Sight, and not appear before
the Nation. Oh dear ! I have forgot it half:
My Lady was in such a piteous Taking, I forget
it, I believe, as loon as she said it. What
shall I do ?-

No Matter, said Granville, I'll overtake her,
and ask

No, no, sir, said Lucy, Pray don't do that,
Sir, only Lady will be very angry: I'll venture
to ask her to tell me over again, and come back.
and let you know it.

But tell me, reply'd Glanville, Was any thing'
the Matter with your Lady ? She was in a piteous
Taking, you say.

Oh dear ! yes, Sir, said Lucy; but I was not
bid to say any thing about that. To be sure,?
my Lady did cry sadly, and sighed as if her
Heart would break; but I don't know what
was the Matter with her.

Wel!, said Glanville, excessively shocked at
this Intelligence, Go to your Lady ; I am going
Home-You may bring me her Mefigeto
my own Apartment.

Lury did as she was desired; and Mr. Glanville,
impatient as he was to unravel the mystery,
yet dreading lest his Presence should, make

Arabella be guilty of fine Extravagance before
the Servants wl.o were with her, he fullovxl
slowly after her, resolving if possible, to procure
a private Interview with the lovely Vii nary,
for whole Sorrow, tho' he suspected it was
owing to some ridiculous Cause, he could not
help being baffled.

Not much plainer than the former.
Arabella, who had walk'd as fast asher
Legs would carry her, got Home
before Lucy could overtake her, and retiring to
her Chamber, gave Way to a fresh Burst cf
Grief, and bewail'd the Infidelity of Glanville
in Terms befitting a Clelia or Mandana.

As s,,on as she saw Lucy enter, the started
from her Chair with great Emotion.

Thou comet, said she, I know, to intercede
for that ungrateful Man, whose Infidelity
I am weak enough to lament: But c.p.n nut
thy Mouth, I charge thee, in his De once.

No, indeed, Madam, said Lucy.
Nor being me any Account of his Tears, his
Desperation, or his Despair, said Arabella, since
questionless he will feign them all to deceive
me.

Here Glanville, who had watch'd Lucy's coming,
and had follow'd her into Arabella's Papa t-
mente appear'd at the Door.

Oh Heav'ns ! cry*d Arabella lifting up'her
fineness, Can it be that this disloyal Man, unaw'd
by the Discovery of his Guilt, again pre-fumes
to approach me !

Dearest Cousin, said Glanville, What is the
Meaning of all this ? - How have I dif6bli'd
you? - What is my Offence? I beseech you,
tell me.

Ask the inconstant Ariamenes, replied
Arabella, the Offence of the ungrateful Glanville.
The Betrayer of Cyneia can bees answer
tlh:t Question to the Deceiver of Arbela. And
the Guilt of the one can only be compared to
the Crimes of the other.

Good God! interrupted Mr. Glanville fretting
excessively, What am I to understand by
all this ? On my Soul, Madam, I don't know
the Meaning of one Word you say.

Oh Dissembler! said Arabella, Is it thus that
thou world's impose upon my Credulity ? Does
not the Name of triangles make thee tremble
then? And can'st thou hear that of Cynecia
without Confusion ?

Dear Lady Bell,, said Glanville smiling,
-What are there Names to me ?

False Man, interrupted Arabella, Dost thou
presume to fort with thy Crimes then?' Are
not the Treacheries of AIiamenes the Crimes of
Glanville? Could Ariamenes be fife to the'Prin-

Mr. Glanville, who had never heard her in
his Opinion, talk so ridiculously before, was si
amaz'd at the incomprehensible Stuff he utter'd
with so much Emotion, that he began to fear
her IntelleCts were really touch'd. This
Thought gave him a Concern that spread itself
in a Moment over his Countenance. He gaz'd
on her with a six'd Attention, dreading, yet
wishing she would speak again; equally divided
between his Hopes, that her next Speech would
remove his Suspicion, and his Fears, that it
might more confirm them.

Arabella taking Notice of his pensive Posture,
turn'd away her Head, left by beholding him,
she (hould relent, and treat him with less Severity
than (he had intended; making at the same
Time a Sign to him to be gone.

Indeed, Lady Bella, said Glanville who understood
her perfectly well, I cannot leave you
in this Temper. I muss know how I have
been so unfortunate as to offend you.

Arabella, no longer able to contain herself,
bari into Tears at this Question: With one
Hand she made repeated Signs to him to begone,
with the other she held her Handkerchief
to her Eyes) vex'd and ashamed of her Weakness.


But Mr. Glanville, excessively shocked at this
Sight, instead of leaving her, threw himself on
his Knees before her, and taking her Hand,
which he tenderly prest to his Lips,

Good God! my dearest Cousin, said he,
How you digital me b this Behaviour $ure

N 6 mtfomhing

something extraordinary must be the Matter.
What can it be that thus affairs you-Am I
the Cause of these Tears Can I have offended
you so much-speak, dear Madam Let me
know my Crime. Yet may I perish if I am
cons, ious of any towards you-disloyal

Man, raid Arabella dis-engaging her
Hand from his, Does then the Crime of Aria-menes
seem so light in thy Apprehension, that
thou can't hope to be thought innocent by
Arabella ? No, no, ungrateful Man, the unfortunate
C)'necia stall have no Cause to say,
that I will triumph in her Spoils. I myself will
be the Minister cf her Revenge; and Glanville
fh; 11 sussex Sr the Crime of Ariamcnes.

Who the Devil is this Armaments, cry'd
Glanville rifirn in a Passion ? And why am I to
(ult:fr for his Crime, pray ? For Heav'ns Sake,
deer Cousin, don't let your Imagination wan-ver
thus. Upon my Soul, I don't believe there
is any such Person as A/rimcn;es in the World,

Vile Equivocator, said .arabella ; Atiamenes,
tho' !cad to Clnecia, is alive to the deluded
Arabella. The Crimes of Arianenes are tl:e
Guilt of Gat.ville : And if the one has made
himself unworthy of the Princess of Gaul, by
his Perfidy and Ingratitude, the other by his
Baseness and Deceit', merits nothing but Contempt
and Detestation from Arabella.

Frenzy, by ny Soul, (ry'd Glanville muttering
between his Teeth: This is downright
Frenzy.' What shall I do ?-

Hence, from ny Presence, resumed Arabella
salle and ungrateful, Man .persecute me no
rmdr with the hateful Offers of. ty Love. rom

this Moment I banish thee from imy Thoughts
for ever; and neither as Glanville or as aria-menes,
will I ever behold thee mire.

Stay, dear Cousin, said Glanville holding her
(for she was endeavouring, to ruth by him, unwilling
he soult see the Tears that had overspread
her Face as she pronounc'd those Words)
hear me, I beg you, but one Word. Who is
it you mean by Ariamenes-Is it me-tell
me, Madam, I beseech you-This is fi:me horrid
Mistake-you have been impos'd upon by
fume villainous Artifice - Speak, dear Lady
Bella-Is it me you mean by Ariamenes ? For
so your last Words seemed to hint-arabella,

without regarding what hIe said,
struggled violently to force her Hand from his:
and finding him still earnest to detain her, told
him with an enraged Voice, That she would
call for Help, if he did not unhand-ser directly.

Poor Glanville, at this Menace, submissively
dropt her Hand; and the Moment she was free,
she flew out of the Room, and locking herself
up in her Closet, sent her Commands to him
by one of her Women, whom (he call'd to
her, to leave her Apartment immediately.

Containing indeed wo great Matters, but

being a Prelude to greater.
n4R. Glanville,. who flood six'd like a Statue

l in the Place where Arabella had left him,
was rous'd by;thi¬ß Message which tho' palliated

a little by the Girl that deliver'd it, who was
not quite so punctual as Lucy, nevertheless filled
him with extreme Confusion. He obeyed however
immediately, and retiring to disown Apr t-
ment, endeavour'd to recall to his Memory all
Lady Bella had said.

The Ambiguity of her Style, which had led
him into a Suspicion he had never entertain'd
before, her last Words had partly explain'd, if
as he understood she did, the meant him by
Ariamenes. Taking this for granted, he easily
conceiv'd some Plot grounded on her Romantick
Notions had been laid, to prepossess her
against him.

Sir George's Behaviour to her rushed that Moment
into his Thoughts: He instantly recollect
all his Fooleries, his History, his Letter, his
Conversation, all apparently copied from those
Books the was so fond of, and probably done
with a View to some other Design upon her.

These Reflections, join'd to his new awak'd
Suspicions, that he was in Love with her, convinc'd
him he was the Author of their present
Misunderstanding ; and that he had impos'd
rome new Fallacy upon Arabella, in order to
promote a Quarrel between them.

Shred almost to Madness at this Thought,.he
stamped about his Room, vowing Revenge upon
Sir George, execrating Romances, and cursing
his own Stupidity for not discovering Sir
George was his Rival, and knowing his plotting
Talent, not providing against his Artifices.

His first Resolutions were to set out immediately
for Sir George's Seat, and force him to
cottage the Part be had aed assails him:, Buta

Moment's Cotlfieratimn convince(! him, that
was not the most probable Place to find him in,
since it was much mere likely he was waiting
the Success of his Schemes in Londml, or perhaps
at Richmond.

Next to satiating his Vengeance, the Pleasure
of detecting him in filch a Manner, that he
could not possibly deny or palliate hisGuilt, was
next his Heart.

He resolv'd therefore to give it out, that he
was gone to London, to make Lady Bella believe
it was in Obedience to her Commands
that he had left her, with a Purpose not to return
till he had clear'd his Innocence ; but in
reality to conceal himsel in his own Apartment,
and see what Effecs his reputed Absence would
produce.

Having thus taken his Resolution, he sent
for Mr. Roberts his Father's Steward, to whose
Care he had entrusted Lady Bella in heretics
and acquainting him with Part of his
'Apprehensions with Regard to Sir George's attends
upon his Cousin; he imparted to him
his Design of slaying conceal'd there, in order
'to discover more effectually those Attempts, and
to preserve Lady Bella sion any Consequence
of them.

Mr. Roberts approv'd of his Design; and assur'd
him of his Vigilance and Care, both in
concealing his Stay, and also in giving him Notice
of e'trry:Thing that pass'd.

Mr. Glanville then wrote a short Billet to
"fradlla, expressing his Grief for hei Displeasure,
hit Departure in Obedience tother Orders,
'and his Refolih ti ot to appear i her defence,

till he co ld give her convincing Proofs of his
Innocence.

This Letter he sent by Roberts, which
to read, but would return no
Answer.

Mr. Glanville then mounting his Horse,
which Roberts had order'd to be got ready, rode
away, and leaving him at a House he sometimes
put up at, return'd on Foot, and was Jet in by
Mr. Roberts at the Garden-door, and conduced
unseen to his Chamber.

While he pass'd that Night and great Part of
the next Day, meditating on the Treachery of
Sir George, and soothing his Uneasiness with the
Hopes of Revenge, Arabella, no less disquieted,
mus'd on the Infidelity of her Lover, the despair
of Cynecia, and the Impossibility of her
ever being happy, Then ransacking her Memory
for Instances in her Romances of Ladies
equally unfortunate with herself, the would
sometimes compare herself to one Lady, fume-times
to another, adapting their Sentiments,
and making Use of their Language in her complaints.


Great Part of the Day being spent in this
Manner, the uneasy Restlessness of her Mind
made her wish to see Cynecia again. She long'd
to ask her a hundred Questions about the unfaithful
A sameness, which the Suddenness of ter
Departure, and her own Astonishment prevented
her from doing, when she made that fatal Discovery,
which had cost her so much Uneasiness.

Sometimes a faint Hope would arise in her
Mind that Cynecia might be mistaken, thro' the
great Resemblance that possibly was between
ramuw~e and Glamnvie. She

She remember'd that Mandana had been deceiv'd
by the Likeness of Cyrus to Spiitridates;
and concluded that illustrious Prince inconstant,
because Spitrilates, whom the took for Cyrus,
saw her carry'd away, without offering to
rescue her.

Dwelling with Eagerness upon this Thought,
because it afforded her a temporary Relief from
others more tormenting, she resolv'd to go to
the Park, tho' she had but little Hopes of finding
Cynecia there ; supposing it but too probable,
that the Disturbance which the Sight, or
fancy'd Sight of Armaments had given her, would
confine her for some Days to her Chamber.
Yet however small the Probability was of meeting
with her, she could not resist the impatient
Desire she felt of going to seek her.

Dispensing therefore with the Attendance of
any other Servant but Lucy, she left her Apartment,
with a Design of resuming her usual
Walk, when she was met at her stepping out of
the Door by Lady L-'s three Daughters, (who
had visited her during her Residence at Richmond)
and another young Lady.

These Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their
Rural Diversions, were going to cross over to
Twickenham, and walk there, prest Lady Bella
to accompany them. Our melancholy Heroine
refus'd them at first, but upon their repeated
Importunity, recollecting that the Princess of
Gaul had inform'd her she refined there, she
consented to go, in Hopes some favourable
Chance might bring her in their Way, or discover
the Place of her Retreat, when the could
easily find some Excuse for leaving her Companions,
and going to her, Mr.

Mr. Roberts, who according to his Instructions,
narrowly watch'd Arabella's Motions, finding
the did not command his Attendance as
usual, resolv'd however to be privately of this
Party. He had but just Time to run up and
acquaint Mr. Glinviil&', and then follow'd the
Ladies at a Distance, who taking Boat, pass'd
over to Twickenham, which he also did as soon
as he saw them landed.

C HAP. VIII.
Which acquaints the Reader with two very

M R. Glanville who did not doubt but

Roberts would bring him some Intelligence,
sat waiting with anxious Impatience for
his Return. The Evening drew on apace, he
number'd the Hours, and began to grow uneasy
at Arabella's long Stay. His Chamber Window
looking into the Garden, he thought he
saw his Cousin, cover'd with her Veil as usual,
hasten down one of the Walks; his Heart
leap'd at this transient View, he threw up the
Sash, and looking out, saw her very plainly
strike into a cross Walk, and a Moment after
saw Sir George, who came out of a little Summerhouse,
at her Feet. Transported with
Rage at this Sight, he snatched up his Sword,
flew down the Stairs into the Garden, and
came running like a Madman up the Walk in
which the Lovers were. The Lady observing
*bim first, for Sir George's Back was towards

him, shrieked aloud and not knowing what
fie did, rare towards the House, crying for
Help, and came back as half, yet not Time
enough to prevent Mischief: For Mr. Glanville,
actuated by an irresistible Fury, cry'd out
to Sir George to defend himself, who had but
just Time to draw his Sword and make an ineffectual
Pass at Mr. Glanville, when he receiv'd
his into his Body, and fell to the Ground.

Mr. Glanville losing his Resentment insensibly
at the Sight of his Rival's Blood, threw
down his Sword, and endeavour'd to suppose
him; while the Lady, who had lost her Veil
in her running, and to the great Astonishment
of Mr. Glanville, prov'd to be his Sister, came
up to them, with Tears and Exclamations,
blaming herself for all that had happen'd.
Mr. Glanville, with a Heart throbbing with Remorse
for what he had done, gaz'd on his Sister
With an accusing Look, as she hung over the
wounded Baronet with streaming Eyes, sometimes
wringing her Hands, then clasping them
together in an Agony of Grief.

Sir George having Strength enough left to
observe her Disorder, ani tlw generous Concern
of Glanville, who holding him in his Arms,
intreated his Fitter to send for proper Assistance,
Dear Charles, said he, you ate too kind, I
have us'd you very ill, I, have deserv'd my
Death from your Hand-You know not what
I-have been base enough to practise against yours
I can but live to clear your Innocence to
Lady Bella, and free you from the Consequences
of this Ation, I shall die satisfied

Strength failing him at these Words, he
fainted away in Mr. Glanville's Arms; who tho'
now convinc'd of his Treachery, was extremely
flocked at the Condition he saw him in.

Miss Glanville renewing her Tears and Exclamations
at this Sight, he was oblig'd to lay
Sir George gently upon the Ground, and ran to
find out somebody to send for a Surgeon, and
to help him to convey him into the House.

In his Way he was met by Mr. Roberts, who
was coming to seek him ; and with a Look of
Terror and Confusion told him, Lady Bella
was brought Home extremely ill-that her Life
had been in Danger, and that she was but just
recover'd from a terrible fainting Fit.

Mr. Glanville, tho' greatly alarm'd at this
News, forgot not to take all possible Care of
Sir George; directing Roberts to get some Person
to carry him into the House, and giving
him Orders to procure proper Assistance, flew
to Lady Bella's Apartment.

Her Women had just put her to Bed, raving
as in a firing Delirium. Mr. Glanville approach'd
her, and finding (he was in a violent
Fever, dispatched a Man and Horse immediately
to Town, to get Physicians, and to acquaint
his Father with what had happen'd.

Mr. Roberts, upon the Surgeon's Report that
Sir George was not mortally wounded, came
to inform him of this good News, but he found
him incapable of lifting to him, and in Agonies
not to be exprest. 'Twas with Difficulty
they forc'd him out of Arabella's Chamber into
his own; where throwing himself upon his
bat, he refiis'd to see or speak to any Body, till

he was told Sir Charles and the Physicians were
arriv'd.

He then ran eagerly to hear their Opinions of
This beloved Cousin, which he soon discovered
by their significant Gestures and half pronounc'd
Words, to be very bad. They comforted him
however, with Hopes that she might recover,
and insisting upon her being kept very quiet,
oblig'd him to quit the Room. While all the
necessary Methods were taken to abate the Violence
of the Disease, Sir Charles, who had been
inform'd by his Steward of his S','q Di)cl with
Sir George, was amaz'd to the last Deer ee at
two such terrible Accidents.

Having seen his Son to his Chamber, and recommended
him to be patient and composed,
he went to visit the young Baronet, anil was
not a little surprized to find his Daughter sitting
at his Bed's Head, with all the Appearance of
a violent Affection.

Indeed Mils Glanville's Cares were so wholly
engrossed by Sir George's, that she hardly
ever thought of her Cousin Arabella, and had
jut sept into her Chamber white the Surgeons
were dressing Sir George's Wound, and renew'd
her Attendance upon him as soon as that was
over.

Miss Glanville' however, thought proper to
make Come trifling Excuses to her Father for
her Solicitude about Sir George. And the
young. Baronet, on whom the Fear of Death
produc'd its usual Effecs, and made him extremely
concern'd for the Errors of his past
Life, and very desirous of atoning for them if
possible, assured Sir Charles, that if he liv'd he

would offer himself to his Acceptance for a Son-in-law;
declaring that he had basely trifled
with the Esteem of his Daughter, but that the
had wholly subdued him to herself by her forgiving
Tenderness.

Sir Charles was very desirous of knowing the
Occasion of his Quarrel with his Son, but Sir
Geaoge was too weak to hold any further conversation,
upon which Sir Chalks, after a short
V'il:t retir'd, taking Miss Glanville along with
him.

That the Reader, whose Imagination is no
doubt upon the Stretch to conceive the Meaning
ol these Two extraordinary Incidents, may be
left no longer in Suspence, we think proper to
explain them both in the following Chapter,
that we may in the next pursue our History
without Interruption.

Which will be found to contain Information

absolutely necessary for the right
understanding of this History.
O U R fair and afflicted Heroine, accompanied

by the Ladies we have mention'd,
having crossed the River, pursued their Walk
upon its winding Banks, entertaining themselves
with the usual Sticks of Conversation
among young Ladies, such .as their Winnings
and Losings at Brag, the Prices of Silks, the
newest Fashions, the best Hair-cutter, the
Scandal at the last Assembly, &c.

Arabella was so disgusted with this (as she
thought) insipid Discourse, which gave no Relief
to the Anxiety of her Mind, but added a
Kind of Fretfulness and Impatience to her
Grief; that she rt solved to quit them, and with
Lucy, go in quest of the Princess of Gaul's
Retreat.

The Ladies however, insisted upon her not
leaving them i and her Excuse that she was
going in search of an unfortunate Unknown,
for whom she had vow'd a Friendship, made
them all immediately resolve to accompany her,
extremely diverted with the Oddity of the Design,
and sacrificing her to their Mirth by sly
Leers, Whispers, stifled Laughs, and a thou-land
little sprightly Sallies, which the disconsolate
Arabella took no Notice of, so deeply were
her Thoughts engag'd.

Tho' she knew not which Way to direct her
Steps, yet concluding the melancholy Clccia
would certainly chute some very solitary Place
for her Residence, she rambled about among
the least frequented Paths, follow'd by the young
Ladies, who ardently desired to see this unfortunate
Unknown; tho' at /rabrila's earnest
Request, they promis'd not to shew themselves
to the Lady, who, she inform'd them, for
very urgent Reasons, was oblig'd to keep herself
conceal'd.

Fatiguing as this Ramble was to the delicate
Spirits of arabella's Companions, they were enabled
to support it by the Diversion her Behaviour
afforded them.
Every Peasant flie met, flie enquir'd if i Beautiful
Lady disguised did not'. :
thereabout.

To some she gave a Description of her Person,
to others an Account of the Domestics
that were with her; not forgetting her Dress,
her Melancholy, and the great Care she took
to keep herself concealed.

These strange Enquiries, with the strange
Language in which they were made, not a little
surprized the good People to whom she addressed
herself, yet niov'd to RefpCe by the majestic
Loveliness of her Person, they answered
her in the Negative, without any Mixture ol
Scoff and Impertinence.

How unfavourable is Chance, said Ai'abd'.
fretting at the Disappointment, to Persons who
have any Reliance upon it! This Lady that I
have been in Search of so long without Success,
may probably be found by others who do not
seek her, whose Presence she may wish to
avoid, yet not be able.

The young Ladies finding it grew late, expressed
their Apprehensions at being without any
Attendants; and desired 4ral,(la to give over
her Search for that Day. .rablla at this Hint
of Danger, enquir'd very earnestly, If they apt
pretended any Attempts to carry them away '
And without staying for an Answer, urg'd them
to walk Home as fast as possible, apologizing
for the Danger into which she had so indiscreetly
drawn both them and herself; yet added her
Hopes, that if any Attempt should be matt:
upon their Liberty, some generous Cavalier
would pass by who would rescue them: A Thing
so common, that they had no Reason to despair
of it.

Arabella construing the Silence with which
her Companions heard there Assurances, into a
Doubt of their being so favoured by Fortune,
proceeded to inform them of several Instances
wherein Ladies met with unexpected Relief and
Deliverance from Ravishers.

She mention'd particularly the Ri:fcue of
Statira by her own Brother, whom (he imagined
for many Years dead ; that of the Princess
Terence by an absolute Stranger, and many
others, whose Names, Characters and Adventures
she occasionally run over ; all which the
young Ladies heard with inconceivable Astonishment.
And the Detail had such an Effie
upon Arabella's Imagination, bewilder'd as if
was in the Follies of Romances, that 'fling
three or four Horsemen riding along the Road
towards them, she immediately concluded they
would be all seiz'd and carr 'd off.

Possess'd with this Belief, the uttered a loud
Cry, and flew to the Water-side, which alarming
the Ladies, who could nut imagine what
was the Matter, they ran after her a; fast as
possible.

Arabella ftop'd when file came to the Water-fide,
and looking round about, and not perceiving
any B sat to waft them over to Richmond, .;
Thought suddenly darted into her Mind, wu;-
thy those ingenious Books which gave it Birth.

Turning therefore to the Ladies, who all at
once were enquiring the Cause of her Fright;

'Tis now, my fair Companions, laid she,
with a solemn Accent, that the Destinies have

VOL. II. 0 fur-furnished

you with an Opportunity of displaying
in a Manner truly Heroic, the Sublimity
of your Virtue, and the Grandeur of your
Cour-age to the World.

The Aeion we have it in our Power to perform
will immortalize our Fame, and raise us
to a Pitch of Glory equal to that of the renown'd
Clelia herself.

Like her, we may expect Statues ended to
our Honour: Like her, be propos'd as Patterns
to Heroines in ensuing Ages: And like her,
perhaps, meet with Sceptres and Crowns for
our Reward.

What that beauteous Roman Lady perform'd
to preserve herself from Violation by the impious
Sexius, let us imitate to avoid the Violence
our intended Ravishers yonder come to offer us.

Fortune, which has thrown us into this Exigence,
presents us the Means of gloriously
escaping: And the Admiration and Esteem of
all Ages to come, will be the Recompence of
our noble Daring.

Once more, my fair Companions, If your
Honour be dear to you, if an immortal Glory
be worth your freeing, follow the Example
I (hall set you, and equal with me the Roman
Clelia.

Saying this, she plung'd into the Thames, intention
to swim over it, as Clelia did the weber.

The young Ladies, who had listen'd with
fitelt Astonishment at the long Speech she had
made them, tie Purport of which not one of
them understood, screamed out aloud at this

horrid Spectacle, and wringing their Hands,
ran backwards and forwards like district Per.
tons, crying for Help. Lucy tore her Hair,
aid was in the utnil.t Agony of Grief, when
Mr. Roberts, who, as we have said before, kent
them always in Sight, having'obfcrv'd Arabella
running towards the Water-side, follow'd the*
as fast as he could, and came Time enough ups
to see her frantick Action. Jumping into the
River immediately after her, he caught held of
her Gown, apt drew her a'tcr him to the Shore.
A Boat that Instant appearing, lie put her into
it, senseless, and to all Appearance dead. II
and Lucy supporting her, they were wasted over
in a few Moments to the other Side: Her Hnufc
being near the' River, Mr. Roberts carried her
in his Arms to it; and as soon as he saw her
'hew Signs of returning Life, left her to the
Care of the Women, who made haste to put
her into a warm Bed, and ran to find out
Mr. Granville, as we have related.

There remains now only to account for
Sir Legge and Miss Glanville's sudden Appearance,
which happen'd, gentle Reader, erastian
follows.

Miss Glanville, having set out pretty late in
the Afternoon, with a Design of saying a!
Night at Richmond, as her Chaise drove up
Kew-Lane, saw one of her Cousin's Women,
Deborah by Name, talking to a Gentleman,
whom, notwithstanding the Disguise sofa Horseman's
Coat, and a Hat slouched over his Face,
the knew'to be Sir Gtsrge Bcinour.

0 z This

This Sight alarming her Jealousy, and renewing
all her former Suspicions, that her cousin's
Charm s rival'd hers in his Heart, as oxon
as Ihe alighted, finding Arabella was not at
Home, file retir'd in great Anguish of Mind to
her Chamber, revolving in her Mind every
Particular of Sir George's Behaviour to leer cousin
in the Country, and finding new Cause for
Suspicion in every Thing Lie recollected, and
resting upon the Disguise in which she law
him, and his Conference with her Woman, fie
concluded herself had all along been the Dupe
of his Artifice, and her Cousin the real Objet
of his Love.

This Thought throwing her into an Extremity
of RaSe, all her tenderest Emotions were
lost in tl;e Desire of Revenge. She imagin'd
to herself so much Pleasure from exposing his
Treachery, and putting it our of his Power to
deny it, that she resolv'd, whatever it cost her,
to have that Satisfaction.

Supposing therefore Deborah was now return'd,
the rung her Bell, and commanded her
Attendance on her in her Chamber.

The Stern Brow with which She receiv'd
her, frighten'd the Girl, conscious of her Guilt,
into a Disposition to confess all, even before he
was tax'd with any thing.

Miss Glanville saw her Terror, and endeavoured
to heighten it, by entering at once into
Complaints and Exclamations against her,
threatning to acquaint 1.cr Father with her Plots
to betray her Lady, and assuring her of a very
severe Punishment for her Treachery.

Thei Girl, terrified extremely at there menaces,
begg'd Miss Glanville, with Tears, to
forgive her, and not to acquaint Sir Charles or
her Lady, with her Faut ; adding, that she
would connff fs all, and never while she liv'd, do
such a Thing asia;.

Miss Glanville would make her no Promises,
but urg'd her to confess: Upon which Dbnrab
fobbing, own'd, That for the Sake of the Presents
Sir George had made her, she consented to
meet him privately from Time to Time, and
give him an Account of every Thing that
pass'd with Regard to her Lady; not thinking
there was any Harm in it. That according to
his Desires, ice had constantly acquainted him
with all her Lady's Motions, when, and where
(he went, how (he and Mr. Glanville agreed,
and a hundred other Things which he enquir'd
about. That that Day in particular, he had
intreated her to procure him the Means of an
Interview with her Lady, if possible; and understanding
Mr. Glanville was not at Richnnad,
(he had let him privately into the Garden,
where she hop'd to prevail upon her Lady
to go.

What, said Miss Glanville surprized, Is Sir
George waiting for my Cousin in the Garden
then ?

Yes, indeed, Madam, said Deborah: But
I'll go and tell him to wait no longer; and
never speak to him again, if your Ladythip
will but be pleas'd to forgive me.

Miss 'Glanville having taken her Resolution,
not only promis'd Deborah her Pardon, but alto

0 3 ,

a Reward, provided fie would contrive it so,
that she might meet Sir G'e-gc instead of her
Cou sin,

The Girl, having the true Chamber-Maid
Spirit of Intrigue in her, immediately propos'd
her putting on one of her Lay's Veils ; which
as it was now the Close of the Evening, would
disguise her sufficiently; to which Mils Glanville,
transported with tee Thoughts of thus having
an Opportunity cf convincing Sir George ofhis
Perfidy, and reproaching him for it, consented,
and bid her bring it without being observed, into
her Chamber.

Deborah informing her, that Sir George was
,conceal'd in the Summer-House, as soon as file
had equipp'd herself with Arabella's Veil she
went into the Walk that led to it; and Sir George,
believing her to be that Lady, hasten'd to throw
himself at her Feet, and had scarce got through
.half a Speech he had study'd for his present
Purpose, when Mr, Glanville gave a fatal Interruption
to his Heroicks, in the Manner we
have already related,

A/hfrt Chapter indeed, butfullof Matter.
RICHMOND was now a Scene of the utmost

Confusion and Distress. Arabella's
Fever was risen to such a Height, that the was

given over by the Physicians ; and Sir George's
Wounds, tho' not judg'd mortal at firs, yet by
the great Effusion of Blood had left him in {1
weak a Condition, that he was thought to be
in great Danger.

Sir Charles, almost disgraced with the Fears
of the Consequences of Sir George's Death, intreated
his Son to quit the Kingdom; but
Mr. Glanville, protesting he would rather die
than leave Arabella in that Illness, he was
oblig'd to give Bail for his Appearance, in Care
Sir George dy'd: This Affair, notwithstanding
all Endeavours to prevent it, having made a
great Noise.

Poor Sir Charity, opprest as he was with the
Weight of all these Calamities, was yet oblig'd
to labour incessantly to keep up the Spirits of
his Son and Daughter. The fettled Despair of
the one, and the silent swelling Grief of the
other, cut him to the Heart. He omitted no
Arguments his Paternal Affection suggested to
him, to moderate their Afflition. Mr. Glanville
often endeavour'd to assume a Composure
he was very far from feeling,' in order to satisfy
his Father. But Miss Glanville, looking upon
herself to be the Cause of Sir George's Misfortune,
declar'd, She should be miserable all her
Life, if he died.

Arabella in her lucid Intervals, being sensible
of her Danger, prepares for Death, with great
Piety and Constancy of Mind, having solemnly
assured Mr. Glanville of her Forgiveness, who
would not at that Time enter into an Explana-

0 4 tion

tion of the Affair which had gircn her Offence
for fear of perplexing her. She permitted his
Presence often in her Chamber, and defined with
great Earnestness theAfiifiance of sone worthy
Divine in her Preparations for Death. The
Pious and Learned Dotor - at Sir C.Jrlcs's
Intimation of his Niece's Desire, came constantly
twice a Day to attend her. Her Fever,
by a favourable Crisis, and the great Skill of her
Physicians, left her in a Fortnight; but this
-violent Difierrper had made such a Ravage in
her delicate Constitution, and reduc'd her so low
that there seemed very little Probability of her
Recovery. Door ~ , in whom her unfeigned
Piety, her uncommon Firmness of Mind,
had created a great Esteem and Tenderness tother,
took all Opportunities of comforting, exhorting,
and praying by her. The Occasion usher
Illness being the Subject of everybody'
Conversation at Richmond, he gently hinted it
to her, and urg'd her to explain her Reasons for
so extravagant an Action.

In the Divine Frame Arabella was then ins
this Action apLeai'd to her rash and vain-tori.
vous, and she acknowledged it to be so to her
pious Monitor: Yet (he related the Motives,
which induc'd her to it, the Dangerfhie was in
of being carry'd away, the Parity of her circumstances
then with Celia;, nd her emulous
Desire of doing as much' to-preserve her'H o
your as that renowri'd^ Rom Lady didst
hers. ; '- i " ; , . ,

The good Da&or was extrnt:'i uiprd'i';at
this Discourse: He was-beginning to think her

again delirious ; but Arabella added to this Account
such sensible Reasoning on the Nature
of that Fondness for Fame, which prompted
her to so rash an Undertaking, that the Do&:r
left her in frrangeEmbarrafl'ment, not knowing
how to account for a Mind at once lb enlighten'd,
and so ridiculous.

Mr. Glanville, meeting him as he came out
of her Chamber, the Door took this Opportunity
to acknowledge the Difficulties Arabella's
inconsistent Discourse had thrown him into.
Mr. Glanville taking him into his own Apartment,
explain'd the Nature of that seeming
Inconsistency, and expatiated at large upon the
Disorders Romances had occasioned in her Imagination;
several Instances of which he recounted,
and filled the Doctor with the greatest
Astonishment and Concern. He lamented pathetically
the Ruin such a ridiculous Study had
brought on fa noble a Mind ; and assured Mr.
Glanville, he would spare no Endeavours to rescue
it from so shocking a Delusion.

Mr. Glanville thank'd him for his good Design'
with a Transport which his Fears of his
Cousin's Danger almost mingled with Teats;
arid the D'tor and he agreed to txpca for some
few Days longer an Alteration for the better in
the Health of her Body, before he attempted
the Cure of her Mind. Mr. Glanville's extreme
Anxiety had made him in Appearance relent
ths repentant Sir George, contenting hi: ifs
With 'infantry sending twice a Day to enquire
after. his Health, bi4t,had not yet visited hint.

No sooner had the Physicians declared that
Arabella was no longer in Danger, than his
Mind being freed from that tormenting Load
of Suspence under which it had labour'd while
her Recovery was yet doubtful, he went to
Sir George's Chamber, who by reason of his
Weakness, th' lie was also upon the Recovery,
hill kept his Bcd.

Sir George, tho' he ardently wished to see him,
yet confucius of the Injuries he had both done
and designed him, could not receive his Visit
without extreme Confusion: But entering into
the Cause of their Quarrel, as soon as he was
able to speak, he freely acknowledg'd his Fault,
and all th Steps he had taken to supplant him
in Arabella's Affection.

Mr. Glanville understanding by this Means,
that he had brib'd a young Actress to personate
a Princess forsaken by him; and had taught her
all that Heap of Absurdity with which she had
impos'd upondrabella, as has been related, desired
only by Way of Reparation, That when his
Cousin was in a Condition to be spoken to upon
that Subject, he would condescend to own the
Fraud to her ; which Sir George faithfully promising,'
an AQ of Oblivion pass'd on Mr.
Glanville's Side for all former Injuries, and a solemn
Assurance from Sir George of inviolable
Friendship for the future. An Assurance, however,
which Mr. Glanville would willingly have
dispensed with: For tho' not of a vindictive
Temper, it was one of his Maxims, That a
Map who had once betray'd hims it would be
ail Error in Policy ever to trust again.

C A P. XI.
Being in the Author's Opinion, the best

Chapter in this Hifiory.
HE good Divine, who had the Cure of

JlArabela's Mind greatly at Heart, no
sooner perceiv'd that the Health of her Body was
almost restored, and that he might talk to her
without the. Fear of any Inconvenience, than
he introduc'd the Subject of her throwing herself
into the River, which he had before lightly
touch'd upon, and fill declar'd himself dissatisfied
with.

Arabella, row more disposed to defend this,
Point than when languishing underlie Pressure
of Pain and Dejection of Mind, endeavour'd
by Arguments founded upon Romantick Heroism,.
to prove, That it was not only reasonable
and jut, but also great and glorious, and exactly
conformable to the Rules of Heroick Virtue.

The Dotor listened to her with a mix'd
Emotion, between Pity, Reverence, and Amazement:
And tho' in the Performance of his Office
he had been .accustomed to accommodate
his Notions to every Understanding,. and had,
therefore accumulated a great Variety of. Topicks
and Illustrations; yet he found himself
now engag'd in a Controversy 'fr which he was.
not so well prepar'd as he imagin'd,, and was.at

0. 6 a.LoG.

a Lots for rome leading Principle, by which he
might introduce his Reasonings, and begin his
Confutation.

Tho' he law much to praise in her Discourse,
he was afraid of confirming her Obstinacy by
Commendation: And tho' he also found much
to blame, he dreaded to give Pain to a Delicacy
he rever'd.

Perceiving however, that Arabella was silent,
as if expecting his Reply, he resolv'd not to
bring upon himself the Guilt of abandoning her
to her Mistake, and the Necessity of speaking
forc'd him to find something to say.

Tho' it is not easy, Madam, said he, for anyone
that has the HIonur. of conversing with
your Ladyship to preserve his Attention free to
any other Idea, than such as your Discourse
tends immediately to impress, yet I have not-been
able while you was speaking, to refrain
from anime very mortifying Reflections on the.
Imperfection of all human Happiness, and the
uncertain Consequences of all those Advantages
whiche think ourselves not only at Liberty
desire, but oblig'd to cultivate.

Tho Shave known some Dangers and D-:
!elfes, r eply'd Arabella gravely, yet I did not-imagine
myself such a Mirror of Calamity as.
could not be seen without Concern. If my Life.
has not been eminently fortunate, it has yet
fefap'd the great Evils of Persecution, Captivity,.
Shipwrecks and Dangers to which many Ladies
tfarmore illustrious both by Birth and Merit
taro myself, Shave been exposed. And indeed,.

tho' I have foinetinies rais'd Envy, or possibly
incurr'd Hatred, yet I have no Reason to believe
I was ever beheld with Pity before.

The Dotor saw he had not introduced his
Discourse in the most acceptable Manner; but
it was too late to repent.

Let me not, Madam, said he, be censured
before I have fully explained my Sentiments.

That you have been envy'd, I can readily
believe: For who that gives Way to natural
Passions has not Reason to envy the Lady :
? But that you have been hated, I am indeed
less willing to think, tho' I know how easily
the greater Part of Mankind hate those by
whom they are excell'd.

If the Misery of my Condition, reply'd
Isabella, has been able to excite that Melancholy
your first Words seemed to imply, Flattery
will contribute very little towards the Improvement
of it. Nor do I expect from the
Severity of the Sacerdotal Character, any of
those Praises, which I hear perhaps with too
much: Pleasure, from the rest of the World.

Having been so lately on .the brink of that
State, in which all Distinctions but that's Goodness
are.d&roy'd, I have not recover'd so much
ILvitvi; but that I would yet rather bear instructions
than Compliments.

If therefore you have observed in me any
dangerous Tenets, corrupt Passions, or criminal
Desires, I conjure you discover me to my .
ses.; :Let no faire Civility :restrain your Admonitions;,
Let. me know this vil whicb.can.

strike a good Man with Horror, and which I
dread the more, as I do not feel it.

I cannot .suppose that a Man of your Order
would be alarm'd at any other Misery than Guilt:
Nor will I think so meanly of him whole direction
I have intreated, as to imagine he can
think Virtue unhappy, however overwhelm'd
by Disasters or Oppression.

Keep me therefore no longer in Suspence: I
expctc you will exert the Authority of your
Function, and I promise you on my Part, Sincerity
and Submission.

The good Man was now compleatly embarrassed;
he law his Meaning mistaken, but was
afraid to explain it, left he (hould seem to pay
Court by a cowardly Retraction: He therefore
paus'd a little, and Arabella supposed he was
studying for such Expressions as might convey
Censure without Offence.

Sir, said ile, if you are not yet satisfied of
my Willingness to hear your Reproofs, let me
evince my Docility, by intreating. you to confider
yourself as dispensed from all Ceremony
upon this Occasion.

Your Imaginations, Madam,. reply'd the'
Doctor, are too quick for Language;. you conjecture.
too loon, what you do not wait to-hear;
and reason upon Suppositions which cannot
be allowed you.

When I mentioned my Reflections upon human
Misery, I was far from concluding your
Ladyship miserable,. compar'd with the rest of
Mankind ; and though contemplating the abstracted

Idea of possible Felicity, I thought that
even You might be produc'd as an Instance that
it is not attainable in this World, I did not
impute the Imperfection of your State to
Wickedness, but intended to observe, That
though even Virtue be added to external Advantages,
there will yet be something wanting
to Happiness.

Whoever sees you, Madam, will immediately
say, That nothing can hinder you from
being the happiest of Mortals, but Want of
Power to understand your own Advantages.
And whoever is admitted to your Conversation,
will be convinc'd that you enjoy all that Intellectual
Excellence can confer; yet I she you
harassed with innumerable Terrors and Perplexities,
which never disturb the Peace of Poverty
or Ignorance.

I cannot discover, said Arabella, how Poverty
or Ignorance can be privileg'd from casualty
or Violence, from the Ravisher, the
Robber, or the Enemy. I should hope rather
that if Wealth and Knowledge can give nothing
else, they at leafs confer Judgment to
foresee Danger, and Power to oppose it.

They are not indeed, return'd the Doctor,
secured against real Misfortunes, but they are
happily defended from wild Imaginations:
They do not suspect what cannot happen, nor
figure Ravisher at a Distance, and leap into
Rivers to escape them.

Do you suppose then, said Arabella, that 1
wae frighted without Calf ?

It is certain, Madam, reply'd he, that no
Injury was intended you.

Difingennuity, Sir, said Arabella, does not
become a Clergyman-I think too well of your
Understanding to imagine your Fallacy deceives
yourself: Why then should you hope that
it will deceive me ?

The Laws of Conference require that the
Terms of the Question and Answer be the
same.

I ask, if I had not Cause to be frighted ?
Why then am I answered that no Injury was
intended ?

Human Beings cannot penetrate Intentions,
nor regulate their Conduct but by exterior
Appearances. And surely there insufficient
Appearance of intended Injury, and that the
greatest which my Sex can sussex.

Why, Madam, said the Dcaor, should you
fill persist in so wild an Assertion ?

A coarse Epithet, laid arabella, is no
Confutation. It retss upon you to shew, That
in giving Way to my Fears, even supposing
them groundless, I departed from the Character
of a reasonable Person.

-am afraid, replied the Doctor, of a dispute
with your Ladyship, not-because I
think myself in Danger of.Defeat, hut because
being accustomed to speak to Scholars
with Scholastick Ruggedness, I may perhaps
depart in the Heat of Argument frome that
Respect to which youthave so great a Right,
and give Offence. to a Person I ai'really'
afraid to displease. c -.

But, if you will promise to excise my
Ardour, I will endeavour to prove that you
have been frighted without Reason.

I (hould be content, replied Arabella, to
obtain Truth upon harder Terms, and therefore
intreat you to begin.

The Apprehension of any future Evil, Madam,
said the Divine, which is called Terror,
when the Danger is from natural Causes,
and. Suspicion, when it proceeds from a moral
Agent, must always arise from Comparison.


We can judge of the Future only by the
Pas, and have therefore only Reason to fear
or suspect, when we see the same Causes in
Motion which have formerly produc'd Mischief,
or the same Measures taken as have
before been preparatory to a Crime.

Thus, when the Sailor in certain Latitudes
sees. the Clouds rise, Experience bids
him expect a Storm. When any Monarch
levies Armies, his Neighbours prepare to repentant
Invasion.

This Power of Prognostications,: may, by
Reading and Conversation, be extended beyond
our own Knowledge: And the great
Us of Books, is that of participating without
Labour: or Hazard the Experience of others.
-But upon this Principle how can you find
arty, Reason for your late Fright.

Hi t ,ever . been known,. that a Lady of
yo:.;Ranc-was ;attack'd with such Intentions,
in a Place so publick, Without any

Preparations made by the Violator for Defence
or Escape ?-

Can it be imagin'd that any Man would
so rashly expose himself to Infamy by Failure,
and to the Gibbet by Success ?

Does there in the Records of the World
appear a tingle Instance of such hopeless Villany
?

It is now Time, Sir, said Arabella,, to answer
your Questions, before they are too many
to be remembered.

The Dignity of my Birth can very little
defend me against aa Insult to' which the
Heiresses of great and powerful Empires,
the Daughters of valiant Princes, and the
Wives of renowned Monarchs, have been a
thousand Times exposed.

The Danger which you think so great,
would hardly repel a determin'd Mind; for in
Effect, Who would have attempted my rescue,
seeing that no Knight or valiant Cavalier
was within View?

What then should have hinder'd him from
placing me in a Chariot ? Driving it into
the pathless Desart ? And immuring me hin
a Cafile, among-woods and Mountains ?
Or hiding me perhaps in the Caverns of a
Rock ? Or confining me in some Island of
an immense Lake ?

From all this, Madam, interrupted the
Clergyman, he is hinder'd by Impossibility.

He cannot carry you to any of these dreadful
Places, because there is no filch Castle,
Depart, Cavern, or Lake.

You will pardon me, Sir, said Arabella,
it I recur to your own Principles:

You allow that Experience may be gain'd
hy Books: And certainly there is no Part
of Knowledge in which we are oblig'd to
trust them more than in Descriptive Geography.


The most restless Activity in the longest
Life, can survey but a small Part of the
habitable Globe: And the rest can only be
known from the Report of others.

Universal Negatives are seldom safe, and
are least to be allow'd when the Disputes
are about Objeas of Sense; where one position
cannot be inferr'd from another.

That there is a Castle, any Man who
has seen it may safely affirm. But you cannot
with equal Reason, maintain that there
is no Castle, because you have not seen it.

Why should I imagine that the Face of
the Earth is alter'd since the Time of those
Heroines, who experienc'd so many Changes
of uncouth Captivity ?

Castles indeed, are the Works of Art;
and are therefore subject to Decay. But
Lakes, and Caverns, and Desarts, must always
remain.

And why, since you call for Instances, should
I not dread the Misfortunes which happen'd

to the divine Chelsea, who was carry'd to one
of the Isles of the Thrafymenian Lake ?

Or those which beset the beautiful Candace,
Queen of Ethiopia, whom the Pirate glens
wander'd with on the Seas ?

Or the Accidents which imbitter'd the Life
of the incomparable Cleopatra ?

Or the Persecutions which made that of the
fair Elifa miserable ?

Or, in fine, the various Distresses of many
other fair and virtuous Princesses: Such as
those which happen'd to Olympia, Bellanmra,
Parifatis, Terence, Amalagantha, Agone, Al.
.yfinda, Placid, Fine, Deidamia, and a
thousand others I could mention.

To the Names of many of these illustrious
Sufferers I am an absolute Stranger, replied the
Doctor.

Tie rest I faintly remember some Mention
of in those contemptible Volumes, with which
Children are sometimes injudiciously suffered
to amuse their Imaginations; but which I
little expected to hear quoted by your Ladyflip
in a serious Discourse. '

And though I am very far from catching
Occasions of Resentments yet I think myself
at Liberty to observe, That if I merited your
Censure for one indelicate Epithet, we have
engag'd on very unequal Terms, if I may
not likewise complain of such contemptuous
Ridicule as you are pleas'd to exercise-pon
my Opinions by opposing them with the Authority
of Scribblers,, not only of Fictions,

but of senseless Visions; which at once vitiate
the Mind, and pervert the Misunderstanding
; and which if they are at any Time
read with Safety, owe their Innocence only to
their Absurdity.

From these Books, Sir, said Arabella, which
you condemn with so much Ardour, though
you acknowledge yourself little acquainted
with them, I have learnt not to recede from
the Conditions I have granted, and hall not
therefore censure the Licence of your Language,
which glances from the Books upon the
Readers.

These Books, Sir, thus corrupt, thus absurd,
thus dangerous alike to the Intellect
and Morals, I have read ; and that I hope
without Injury to my Judgment, or my Virtue.


The DoAu-r, whose Vehemence had hinder'd
him from discovering all the Consequences
of his Position, now found himself entangled,
and reply'd in a submissive Tone,

I confess, Madam, my Words imply an
Accusation very remote from my Intention.

It has always been the Rule of my Life, not
to justify any Words or Ations because they
mine.

I am ashamed of my Negligence, I am
sorry for my Warmth, and intreat your ladyship
to pardon a Fault which I hope never
to repeat.

The Reparation, Fir, laid Arabella smiling,
oyer-balances the Offence: and by thus daring

to own you have been in the Wrong, you
have rais'd in ne a much higher Esteem for
you. yOU.

Yet I will not pardon you, added she,
without enjoining you a Penance for the Fault
you own you have committed; and this Penance
shall be to prove,

First, That these Histories you condemn
are Fashions.

Next, That they are absurd.
And Lastly, That they are Criminal.
The Door was pleas'd to find a Reconciliations
offer'd upon so very easy Terms, with
a Person whom he beheld at once with Reverence
and Affection, and could not offend
without extreme Regret.

He therefore answered with a very chearful
Composure:

To prove those Narratives to be Fictions,
Madam, is only difficult, because the Position
is almost to:) evident for Proof.

Your Ladythip knows, I suppose to what
Authors these Writings are ascribed ?

To the French Wits of the last Century,
laid Arabella.

Aid at what Distance, Madam, are the
Fats related in them from the Age of the
Writer ?

I was never exact in my Computation, replied
Arabella ; but I think moll of the Events
happen'd about two thousand Years ago.

How then, Madam, resumed the Doctor,
could these Events be so minutely known to

Writers so far remote from the Time in which
they happen'd ?

By Records, Monuments, emirs, and
Histories, answered the Lady.

But by what Accident, then, said the Door
smiling, did it happen there Records and Monuments
were kept universally lfcret to Mankind
till the last Century ?

What brought all the Memoirs of the re.
motcft Nations and earliest Ages only to
lances ?
Where were they hidden that none could consult
them but a few obscure Authors ?

And whither are they now vanished again
hat they can be found no more ?
Arabella having sat silent a while, told him,
That she found his Questions very difficult to
be answered; and that though perhaps the Authors
themselves could have told whence they
borrowed their Materials, she should not at
present require any other Evidence of the first
Assertion:

But allow'd him to suppose them Pinions,
and requir'd now that he should shew them to
be absurd.

Your Ladyship, return'd he, has, I find,
too much Understanding to struggle against
Demonstration, and too much Veracity to deny
your Convictions; therefore some of the
Arguments by which I intended to (hew the
Falshood of these Narratives may be now used
to prove their Absurdity.

You grant them, Madam, to be Fictions?
Sir, interrupted Arabella eagerly, You are
again infringing the Laws of Disputation.

You are not to confound a Supposition
of which I allow you only the present Use,
with an unlimited and irrevocable Concession.


I am too well acquainted with my own
Weakness to conclude an Opinion false,
merely because I find myself unable to defend
it.

But I am in haste to hear the Proof of the
other Positions, not only because they may
perhaps supply what is deficient in your Evidence
of the first, but because I think it of
more Importance to deter Corruption than
Fiaion.

Though indeed Flood is a Species of Corruption,
and what Falshood is more hateful
than the Falsehood of History.

Since you have drawn me back, Madam,
to the first Question, returned the Door,
Let me know what Arguments your ladyship
can produce for the Veracity of these
Books.

That there are many Objections against
it, you yourself have allowed, and the highest
moral Evidence of Falsehood appears when
there are many Arguments against an Assertion,
and none for it,

Sir, replied Arabella, I shall never think that
any Narrative, which is not confuted by its
own Absurdity, is without one Argument at
least on its Side ; there is a Love of Truth in
the human Mind, if not naturally implanted,
so easily obtained from Reason and Experience,
that I should expect it universally to
prevail where there is no strong Temptation to
Deceit; we hate to be deceived, we therefore
hate those that deceive us; we desire not to
he hated, and therefore know that we are not
to deceive. Shew me an equal Motive to
Falshood, or confers that every Relation has
some Right to Credit.

This may be allowed, Madam, said the Doctor,
when we claim to be credited, but that
seems not to be the Hope or Intention of their
Writers.

Surely Sir, replied Arabella, you must mistake
their Design; he that writes without Intention
to be credited, must write to little Purpose;
for what Pleasure or Advantage can a-
rise from Fads that never happened ? What
Examples can be afforded by the Patience
of those who never suffered, or the Chastity of
those who were never solicited ? The great
End of History, is to shew how much human
Nature can endure or perform. When we
hear a Story in common Life that raises our
Wonder Compassion, the first Confutation
Stills our Emotions, and however we were
touched before, we then chase it from the Memory
with Contempt as a Trifle, or with Indignation
as an Imposture. Prove, therefore,
that the Books which I have hitherto read as
VOL I. I P Co.

Copies of Life, and Models of Conduct, are
empty Fictions, and from this Hour I deliver
them to Moths and Mould; and from this
'Time consider their Authors as Wretches who
cheated me of those Hours I ought to have
dedicated to Application and Improvement,
and betrayed me to a Waste of those Years in
which I might have laid up Knowledge for my
future Lite.

Shakespeare, said the Dotor, calls just resentment
the Child of Integrity, and therefore
I do not wonder, that what Vehemence the
Gentleness of your Ladyflip's Temper allows,
should be exerted upon thisOccafion. Yet
though I cannot forgive there Authors for having
destroyed so much valuable Time, yet I
cannot think them intentionally culpable, because
I cannot believe they exp tied to be credited.
Truth is not always injured by Ilion.
An admirable * Writer of our own Time, has
found the Way to convey the most solid instructions,
the nobles Sentiments, and the most
exalted Piety, in the pleating Dress of a t Novel,
and, to use the Words of the greatest :
Genius in the present Age, " Has taught t! e
Passions to move at the Command of Virtue."
The Fables of .fpi though never
I suppose believed, yet have been long considered
as Lectures of moral and domestic
Wisdom, so well adapted to the Faculties of
Man, that they have been received by all civilized
Nations; aid the Ara/is themselves hive
honoured his Translator with the Appellations
of LectMIn the Wife. Se

;,le ,ii,%r,. j. ctR.,-r,
'lit¬¢ Author If lyle Ros l'.,

The Fables of Sop, said alabcilra, are among
Those of which the Absurdity discovers
itself, and the Truth is complied in the Application
; but what can be said of thole Tales
which are told with the solemn Air of historical
Truth, and if false convey no Instruction ?

That they cannot be defended Madam, Laid
thcDoctor, it is my Purpose to prove, and if to
evince their Falshood be sufficient to procure
their Banishment from your Ladyship's Choler,
their Day of Grace is near an end. How is
any oral, or written Testimony, confuted or
confirmed ?

By comparing it, says the Lady, with the
Testimony of others, or with the natural Es-sets
and standing Evidence of the Facts related,
and Sometimes by comparing it with itself.

If then your Ladyship will abide by this last,
returned he, and compare these Books with
antient; Histories, you will not only find innumerable
Names, of which no Mention was
ever made before, but Persons who lived indifferent
Ages, engaged as the Friends or Rivals
of each other. You will perceive that
your Authors have parcelled out the World at
Discretion, erected Palaces, and established
Monarchies wherever the Conveniency of
their Narrative required them, and set Kings
and Queens over imaginary Nations. Nor have
they considered themselves as inveRted with less
'Authority over the Works of Nature, than the
Inflitutions of Men; for they have distributed
Mountains and Desarts, Gulphs and Rock:,
wherever they wanted them, and whenever the
Course of their Story required an Expedient,

P 2 raiftc

tailed a gloomy Forest, or overflowed the Regions
with a rapid Stream.

I suppose, laid Arabella, you have no Intention
to deceive me, and since, if what Vou
have asserted be true, the Cause is indefensible,
I shall trouble you no longer to argue on
this Topic, but desire now to hear why, supposing
them Fictions, and intended to be received
as Fictions, you censure them as absurd
?

The only Excellence of Falsehood, answered
-he, is its Resemblance to Truth ; as therefore
any Narrative is more liable to be confuted by
its Inconsistency with known Facts, it is at a
greater Distance from the Perfection of section;
for there can be no-Difficulty in framing
a Tale, if we are left at Liberty to invert alU
History and Nature for our own Convenience.
When a Crime is to be concealed, it is easy
to cover it with an imaginary Word. When
Virtue is to be rewarded, a Nation with
a new Name may, without any Eg-pence
of Invention, raise her to the Throne,
When Adioo was told of the Magnificence of
his Palaces, he answered, that the Cost of poetical
Architecture was very little; and
still less is the Cost of Building without Art,
than without Materials. But their historical
Failures may be easily passed over, when we
consider their physical or philosophical Absurdities;
to bring Men together from different
Countries does not fhockwith every inherent or
demonstrable Absurdity, and therefore when
we read only for Amusement, such Improprieties
may be born: But who can forbear to

throw away the Story thzl gives to one Man
the Strength of Thousands; that puts Life
or Death in a Smile or a Frown; that recent's
Labours and Sufferings to which the Powers
of Humanity are utterlyunequ!; That disfigures
the whole Appearance of the World, and represents
every Thing in a Form different from
that which Experience has shewn. It is the
Fault of the best Fictions, that they teach
young Minds to expect strange Adventures
and sudden Vicissitudes, and therefore encourage
them often to trust to Chance. A long
Life may be palled without a single Occurrence
that can cause much Surprize, or produce
any unexpected Consequence of groat
Importance; the Order of the World is so
established, that all human Affairs proceed ina
regular Method, and very little Opportunity
is left for Sallies or Hazards, for Assault or
Rescue ; but the Brave and the Coward, the
Sprightly and the Dull, sussex themselves to
be carried alike down the Stream of Custom.

Arabella, who had for some Time listened
with a With to interrupt him, now took
Advantage of a short Pause. I cannot imagin,
Sir, said she, that you intend to deceive mc,
and therefore I am inclined to believe that ycu
are yourself mistaken, and that your Application
to Learning has hindered you from that
Acquaintance with the World, in which thcec
Authors excelled I have not long conversed
in Public, yet I have found that Life is subject
to many Accidents. Do you count my
late Escape for nothing ? Is it to be numbered
among daily and cursory Transactions, that a

Won:ln flies from a Ravilher into a rapid
Stream?

You must not, Madam, said the Doctor,
urge as an Argument the Fade which is at present
the Subject of Dispute.

Arabella blushing at the Absurdity she 'had
been guilty of, and not attempting any Subterfuge
or Excuse, the Doflor found himself
at Liberty to proceed:

You nuns not imagine, Madam, continued
he, that I intend to arrogate any Superiority,
when I observe that your Ladyship mus sussex
me to decide, in some Pleasure authoritatively,
whether Life is truly described in those Books;
the Likeness sofa Piaure can only be determined
by a Knowledge of the Original. You
have yet had little Opportunity of knowing the
Ways of Mankind, which cannot be learned
hut from Experience, and of which the highest
Understanding, and the lowest, mus enter the
World in equal Ignorance. I have lived
long in a public Character, and have thought
it myDuty to study those whom I have undertaken
to admonish or influx. I have never
been so rich as to affright Men into Disgust
and Concealment, nor so poor as to be kept
at a Distance too great for accurate Observa
tion. I therefore presume to tell your ladyship,
with great Confidence, that your Writers
have inflituted a World of their own, and
that nothing, is more different from a human
Being, than Heroes or Heroines.

I am afraid, Sir, said Arablla, that the
Difference is not in Favour of the present
World.

That, M.ldam, answered he your own
Penetration will enable you to judge when it
shall have made you equally acquainted with
both: I have no desire to determine a Question,
the Solution of which will give so little
Pleasure to Purity and Benevolence.

The Silence of a Man who loves to praise
is a Censure sufficiently severe, Laid the
Lady. May it never happen that you (hould
be unwilling to mention the Name of Arabella.
I hope wherever Corruption prevails in the
World, to live in it with Virtue, or, if I find
myself too much endanger'd, to retire from it
with Innocence. But if you can say so little
in Commendation of Mankind, how will
you prove these Histories to be vicious, which
if they do not describe realise, give us an Idea
of a better Race ps Beings than now inhabit
the World.

It is of little Importance, Madam, replied
the Dotor, to decide whether in the real or
fictitious Life, most Wickedness is to be
found. Books ought to supply an Antidote
to Example, and if we retire to a condemnation
of Crimes, and continue in our
Closets to inflame our Passions, at what time
must we rectify our Words, or purify our
Hearts? The immediate Tendency of there
Books which your Ladyship must allow me to
mention with some Severity, is to give new
Fire to the Passions of Revenge and Loves
two Passions which, even without such powerful
Auxiliaries, it is one of the severely Labours
of Reason and Piety to suppress, and
which yet must be suppressed if we hope to be

approved in the Sight of the only Being
where Approbation can make us Happy. 1
am afraid your Ladyship will think me too
seriously have already learned too much
from you, said Arabella, to presume to
intrust you, yet sussex me to caution you never
to dishonour your sacred Office by theLow-
lines of Apologies. Then let me again observe,
refused he, that there Books soften the
Heart to Love, and harden it to Murder.
that they teach Women to exact Vengeance,
ancien to execute it; teach women ro
expect not only Worship, but the dreadful
Worships human Sacrifices. Every Page of
there Volumes is filled with such extravagance
of Praise, and expressions of Obedience as one
human Being ought not to hear from another;
or with accounts battles, in which thousands
are slaughtered for no other Purpose than to
gain a Smile from the haughty Beauty, who
sits a calm Spectres of the Ruin and desolation,
Bloodshed and Misery, incited by
herself.

It is impossible to read there Tales without
lessening part of that Humility, which
by preserving in us a Sense of our Alliance
with all human nature, keeps awake tenderness
and Sympathy, or without impairing
that Compassion which is implanted in us as
an Incentive to Acts of Kindness. If there be
any preserved by natural Softness, or early
Education from learning Pride and Cruelty,
they are yet in danger of being betrayed to the
Vanity of Beauty, and taught the Arts of
Intrigue .

Love,Madam, is, you know, theBufinefs, the
sole Business of Ladies in Romances. Arabella's
Blushes now hinder'd him from proceeding ashe
had intended. I perceive, continued, he that
my Arguments begin to be less agreeable to
your Ladythip's Delicacy, I shall therefore
insist no longer upon false Tenderness of
Sentiment, but proceed to those Outrages of
the violent Passions which, though not more
dangerous, are more generally hateful.

It is not necessary, Fir, interrupted Arabella,
that you strengthen by any new Proof a Position
which when calmly considered cannot be
denied ; my Heart yields to theForce of Truth,
and I now wonder how the Blaze of Enthusiastic
Bravery, could hinder me from remarking
with Abhorrence the Crime of deliberate
unnecessary Bloodshed.

I begin to perceive that I have hitherto at
least trifled away myTime, and fear that I have
already made some Approaches to the Crime of
encouraging Violence and Revenge. I hope,
Madam, said the good Man with Horror in his
Looks, that no Life was ever lost by your Incitement.
Arabella seeing him thus moved,
burst into Tears, and could not immediately
answer. Is it possible, cried the Dotor, that
such Gentleness and Elegance should be gained
with Blood? Be not too hasty in your Censure,
said Arabella, recovering herself, I tremble indeed
to think how nearly I have approached
the Brink of Murder, when I thought myself
only consulting my own Glory; but whatever
I sussex, I will never more demand or instigate
Vengeance, nor consider ny Punctilios ;'s

important enough to be ballanced against Life.

The Doctor confirmed her in her new Resolutions,
and thinking Solitude was necessary
to compose her Spirits after the Fatigue of so
long a Conversation, he retired to acquaint Mr
Glanville with his Success, who in the Transport
of his Joy was alice ready to throw
hin fel fat hisFeet, to thank him for theMiracle,
as he called ir, that he had performed.

In which the History is concluded.
M R Glanville, who fancied to himself the

mos ravishing Delight from converting
with his lovely Cousin, now recovered to there
Use of all her noble Powers of Reason,
would have paid her a Visit that afternoon,
had not a moments Reflexion convinced him
that now was the Time, when her Mind was
labouring under the force of Condition,
to introduce the repentant Sir George to her,
who by confessing the ridiculous Farce he had
invented to deceive her, might restore him to
her good Opinion, and add to the Doctor's
solid Arguments the poignant Sting of Ridicule
which she would then perceive the had
incurred.

Sir George being now able to leave his Chamber,
and Arabella well enough recovered to
admit a Visit in hers, Mr Glanville intreated
his Father to wait on her, and get Permission

for Sir George to attend her upon a Business
of some Consequence. Sir Charles no sooner
mentioned this Request, than Arabella after
a little Hesitation complied with it. As she
had been kept a Stranger to all the Particulars
of Mr Glanville's Quarrels with the young
Baronet, her Thoughts were a little perplex'd
concerning the Occasion of this Visit, and
her Embarrassment was considerably increased
by the Confusion which she perceived in the
Countenance of Sir George. It was not
without some Tokens of a painfully supprest
Reluctance that Sir George consented to perform
his Promise, when Mr Glanville claim'd
it, but the Disadvantages that would attend
his Breach of it, dejected and humbled as he
now was, presenting themselves in a forcible
manner to his Imagination, confirmed his
wavering Resolutions. And since he found
himself obliged to be his own Accuser, he endeavoured
to do it with the belt Grace he
could. Acknowledging therefore to Lady
Bella all the Artifices her Deception by Romances
had given him Encouragement to
use upon her, and explaining very explicitly
the last with relation to the pretended Princess
of Gaul, he submissively asked her Pardon for
the Offence it would now give her, as well
as for the Trouble it had formerly.

Arabella struck with inconceivable Confusion,
having only bowed reread to hisApoiloy desired
to be left alone, and continued for near two
Hours afterwards wholly absorbed in the must
disagreeable Reflections on the Absurdity of
her-past Behaviour, and the Contempt aRd Ridicule

to which flie now saw plainly she had
exposed herself. The Violence of there first
Emotions having at length subsided, she sent
for Sir Charles, and Mr. Glanville, and having
with a noble Ingenuity expatiated upon the
Follies her vitiated Judgment had led her into,
she apologized to the first, for the frequent
Causes she had given him ofUneaiinefs; and,
turning to Mr. Glanville, whom lie beheld
with a Look of mingled Tenderness and Mo.
testy, To give you myself with all my remaining
ImperfeCtions, is making you but a
poor Present in return for the Obligations your
generous Affection has laid me under to you;
yet since I am so happy as to be desired for a
Partner for Life by a Man of your Sense and
Honour, I will endeavour to make myself as
worthy as I am able of such a favourable distinction.


Mr. Glanville kissed the Hand she gave him
with an emphatic Silence, while Sir Charles,
in the most obliging Manner imaginable,
thanked her for the Honour she conferred both
on himself and Son by this Alliance.

Sir George, entangled in his own Artifices,
saw himself under a Necessity of confirming the
Promises he had made to Miss Glinville during
his Fit of Penitence, and was accordingly married
to that young Lady, at the same Time
that Mr. Glanville and arabella were united.

We chuse, Reader, to express this circumstance,
though the same, in different Words,
as well to avoid Repetition, as to intimate that
the first mentioned Pair were indeed only married

in the common Acceptation of theory;
that is, they were privileged to join Fortunes,
Equipages, Titles, and Expence; while Mr.
Glanville and Arabella were united, as well in
there, as in every Virtue and laudable Assertion
of the Minds
