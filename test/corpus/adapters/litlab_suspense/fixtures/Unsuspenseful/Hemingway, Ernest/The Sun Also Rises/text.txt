CHAPTER I


Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider Kelly‚Äôs star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn‚Äôs distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.

I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly. Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.

Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up.

By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.

The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert‚Äôs mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.

I first became aware of his lady‚Äôs attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l‚Äô Avenue‚Äôs and afterward went to the Caf√© de Versailles for coffee. We had several fines after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace. ‚ÄúI know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town,‚Äù I said.

Somebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went on: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town. She‚Äôs a swell girl.‚Äù

I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert‚Äôs lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

‚ÄúHell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhy go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes.‚Äù

Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said goodnight and went out. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me. ‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhy did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn‚Äôt you see Frances?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make any difference. Any girl. I couldn‚Äôt go, that would be all.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn‚Äôt you see the way she looked?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, well,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go to Senlis.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get sore.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, that will be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll see you to-morrow at the courts,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúGood-night, Jake,‚Äù he said, and started back to the caf√©.

‚ÄúYou forgot to get your paper,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so.‚Äù He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. ‚ÄúYou are not sore, are you, Jake?‚Äù He turned with the paper in his hand.

‚ÄúNo, why should I be?‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you at tennis,‚Äù he said. I watched him walk back to the caf√© holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.





CHAPTER II


That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite changed. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all shifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.

He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have around. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.

Then there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread ‚ÄúThe Purple Land.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Purple Land‚Äù is a very sinister book if read too late in life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is very well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a complete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took every word of ‚ÄúThe Purple Land‚Äù as literally as though it had been an R. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on the whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set him off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office.

‚ÄúHello, Robert,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDid you come in to cheer me up?‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like to go to South America, Jake?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not the real South Americans.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey look awfully real to me.‚Äù

I had a boat train to catch with a week‚Äôs mail stories, and only half of them written.

‚ÄúDo you know any dirt?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúNone of your exalted connections getting divorces?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South America with me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI like this town and I go to Spain in the summertime.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll my life I‚Äôve wanted to go on a trip like that,‚Äù Cohn said. He sat down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be too old before I can ever do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a fool,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou can go anywhere you want. You‚Äôve got plenty of money.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. But I can‚Äôt get started.‚Äù

‚ÄúCheer up,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAll countries look just like the moving pictures.‚Äù

But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand it to think my life is going so fast and I‚Äôm not really living it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in bull-fighters. That‚Äôs an abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I wouldn‚Äôt like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd go there with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo; that doesn‚Äôt interest me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to go to South America.‚Äù

He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.

‚ÄúCome on down-stairs and have a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you working?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. We went down the stairs to the caf√© on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had a drink all you had to say was: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve got to get back and get off some cables,‚Äù and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we went downstairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. ‚ÄúThis is a good place,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of liquor,‚Äù I agreed.

‚ÄúListen, Jake,‚Äù he leaned forward on the bar. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you‚Äôre not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you‚Äôve lived nearly half the time you have to live already?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, every once in a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know that in about thirty-five years more we‚Äôll be dead?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell, Robert,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat the hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing I don‚Äôt worry about,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou ought to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had plenty to worry about one time or other. I‚Äôm through worrying.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I want to go to South America.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, Robert, going to another country doesn‚Äôt make any difference. I‚Äôve tried all that. You can‚Äôt get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There‚Äôs nothing to that.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve never been to South America.‚Äù

‚ÄúSouth America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don‚Äôt you start living your life in Paris?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of Paris, and I‚Äôm sick of the Quarter.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what happens to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt the town nice at night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care for Paris.‚Äù

So there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you really have to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve got to get these cables off.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you mind if I come up and sit around the office?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, come on up.‚Äù

He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair. He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook his head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù he said, and put his head deeper into his arms. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it. Nothing will make me do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRobert,‚Äù I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked.

‚ÄúDid I talk out loud just then?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething. But it wasn‚Äôt clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, what a rotten dream!‚Äù

‚ÄúDid the typewriter put you to sleep?‚Äù

‚ÄúGuess so. I didn‚Äôt sleep all last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúTalking,‚Äù he said.

I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends. We went out to the Caf√© Napolitain to have an ap√©ritif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.





CHAPTER III


It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric signs come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge of the solid taxi traffic, and the poules going by, singly and in pairs, looking for the evening meal. I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her, and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again. She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table. The waiter came up.

‚ÄúWell, what will you drink?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúPernod.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good for little girls.‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle girl yourself. Dites gar√ßon, un pernod.‚Äù

‚ÄúA pernod for me, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúGoing on a party?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. Aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. You never know in this town.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you like Paris?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go somewhere else?‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt anywhere else.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre happy, all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúHappy, hell!‚Äù

Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns milky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops you just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúare you going to buy me a dinner?‚Äù

She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre we moved up the Avenue de l‚ÄôOp√©ra, passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted. The cab passed the New York Herald bureau with the window full of clocks.

‚ÄúWhat are all the clocks for?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúThey show the hour all over America.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kid me.‚Äù

We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.

‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? You sick?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs sick. I‚Äôm sick, too.‚Äù

We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and then turned up the Rue des Saints P√®res.

‚ÄúYou oughtn‚Äôt to drink pernod if you‚Äôre sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou neither.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make any difference with me. It doesn‚Äôt make any difference with a woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you called?‚Äù

‚ÄúGeorgette. How are you called?‚Äù

‚ÄúJacob.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a Flemish name.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmerican too.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Flamand?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, American.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, I detest Flamands.‚Äù

By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the cocher to stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place. ‚ÄúThis is no great thing of a restaurant.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMaybe you would rather go to Foyot‚Äôs. Why don‚Äôt you keep the cab and go on?‚Äù

I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one. It was a long time since I had dined with a poule, and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room. Georgette cheered up a little under the food.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt bad here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt chic, but the food is all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter than you eat in Li√®ge.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrussels, you mean.‚Äù

We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a bad type,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame you‚Äôre sick. We get on well. What‚Äôs the matter with you, anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got hurt in the war,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh, that dirty war.‚Äù

We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some one called: ‚ÄúBarnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a friend calling me,‚Äù I explained, and went out.

There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming to the dance, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Braddocks asked.

‚ÄúWhat dance?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, the dancings. Don‚Äôt you know we‚Äôve revived them?‚Äù Mrs. Braddocks put in.

‚ÄúYou must come, Jake. We‚Äôre all going,‚Äù Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile.

‚ÄúOf course, he‚Äôs coming,‚Äù Braddocks said. ‚ÄúCome in and have coffee with us, Barnes.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd bring your friend,‚Äù said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces.

‚ÄúThanks, we‚Äôll be in,‚Äù I said. I went back to the small room.

‚ÄúWho are your friends?‚Äù Georgette asked.

‚ÄúWriters and artists.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are lots of those on this side of the river.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo many.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so. Still, some of them make money.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù

We finished the meal and the wine. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have coffee with the others.‚Äù

Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and straightened her hat.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she said.

We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his table stood up.

‚ÄúI wish to present my fianc√©e, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,‚Äù I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.

‚ÄúAre you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?‚Äù Mrs. Braddocks asked.

‚ÄúConnais pas,‚Äù Georgette answered.

‚ÄúBut you have the same name,‚Äù Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Georgette. ‚ÄúNot at all. My name is Hobin.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely he did,‚Äù insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking French was liable to have no idea what she was saying.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a fool,‚Äù Georgette said.

‚ÄúOh, it was a joke, then,‚Äù Mrs. Braddocks said.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Georgette. ‚ÄúTo laugh at.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you hear that, Henry?‚Äù Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to Braddocks. ‚ÄúMr. Barnes introduced his fianc√©e as Mademoiselle Leblanc, and her name is actually Hobin.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I‚Äôve known her for a very long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Mademoiselle Hobin,‚Äù Frances Clyne called, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French. ‚ÄúHave you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs she?‚Äù Georgette turned to me. ‚ÄúDo I have to talk to her?‚Äù

She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt like Paris. It‚Äôs expensive and dirty.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities in all Europe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI find it dirty.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here long enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it does have nice people in it. One must grant that.‚Äù

Georgette turned to me. ‚ÄúYou have nice friends.‚Äù

Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks‚Äôs dancing-club.

The dancing-club was a bal musette in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Genevi√®ve. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights it was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came down-stairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.

‚ÄúI wish people would come earlier,‚Äù Braddocks said. The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring.

‚ÄúMy God,‚Äù Georgette said. ‚ÄúWhat a box to sweat in!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hot.‚Äù

‚ÄúHot, my God!‚Äù

‚ÄúTake off your hat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea.‚Äù

Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They both stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys and some in their shirtsleeves, got out. I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.

One of them saw Georgette and said: ‚ÄúI do declare. There is an actual harlot. I‚Äôm going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me.‚Äù

The tall dark one, called Lett, said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you be rash.‚Äù

The wavy blond one answered: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you worry, dear.‚Äù And with them was Brett.

I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take the taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all dance with her. They are like that.

I sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs. Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.

‚ÄúThanks so much,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just had one.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave another.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, I will then.‚Äù

We got the daughter of the house over and each had a fine √† l‚Äôeau.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre from Kansas City, they tell me,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you find Paris amusing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.

‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyes. Don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, how charmingly you get angry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI wish I had that faculty.‚Äù

I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks followed me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be cross with Robert,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still only a child, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt cross,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just thought perhaps I was going to throw up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour fianc√©e is having a great success,‚Äù Mrs. Braddocks looked out on the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one, called Lett.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúRather,‚Äù said Mrs. Braddocks.

Cohn came up. ‚ÄúCome on, Jake,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhave a drink.‚Äù We walked over to the bar. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing. This whole show makes me sick is all.‚Äù

Brett came up to the bar.

‚ÄúHello, you chaps.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, Brett,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you tight?‚Äù

‚ÄúNever going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda.‚Äù

She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation.

Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy‚Äôs. She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fine crowd you‚Äôre with, Brett,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt the Napolitain.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd have you had a lovely evening?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, priceless,‚Äù I said.

Brett laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong of you, Jake. It‚Äôs an insult to all of us. Look at Frances there, and Jo.‚Äù

This for Cohn‚Äôs benefit.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in restraint of trade,‚Äù Brett said. She laughed again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wonderfully sober,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYes. Aren‚Äôt I? And when one‚Äôs with the crowd I‚Äôm with, one can drink in such safety, too.‚Äù

The music started and Robert Cohn said: ‚ÄúWill you dance this with me, Lady Brett?‚Äù

Brett smiled at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve promised to dance this with Jacob,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve a hell of a biblical name, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about the next?‚Äù asked Cohn.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve a date up at Montmartre.‚Äù

Dancing, I looked over Brett‚Äôs shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made a new one there,‚Äù I said to her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, well,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI suppose you like to add them up.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like a fool.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, well. What if I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was playing the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to Georgette dancing with another one of them.

‚ÄúWhat possessed you to bring her?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just brought her.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting damned romantic.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, bored.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not now.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here. She‚Äôs well taken care of.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to?‚Äù

‚ÄúWould I ask you if I didn‚Äôt want to?‚Äù

We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne.

‚ÄúIf the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äôest entendu, Monsieur,‚Äù the patronne said. ‚ÄúYou go now? So early?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said.

We started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good night and took my arm. ‚ÄúGood night, Cohn,‚Äù I said. Outside in the street we looked for a taxi.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to lose your fifty francs,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo taxis.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on and we‚Äôll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt walk across the street.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot if I could help it.‚Äù

We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre out away from them.‚Äù

We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. ‚ÄúWhere should I tell him?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOh, tell him to drive around.‚Äù

I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed the door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.

‚ÄúOh, darling, I‚Äôve been so miserable,‚Äù Brett said.





CHAPTER IV


The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St. Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street. Brett‚Äôs hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the cartracks by the light of acetylene flares. Brett‚Äôs face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get. Her head was down.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt touch me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Brett.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt. You must know. I can‚Äôt stand it, that‚Äôs all. Oh, darling, please understand!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you love me?‚Äù

‚ÄúLove you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there anything we can do about it?‚Äù

She was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back against me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else‚Äôs eyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there were nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she was afraid of so many things.

‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs not a damn thing we could do,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go through that hell again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd better keep away from each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, darling, I have to see you. It isn‚Äôt all that you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but it always gets to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my fault. Don‚Äôt we pay for all the things we do, though?‚Äù

She had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the way into them.

‚ÄúWhen I think of the hell I‚Äôve put chaps through. I‚Äôm paying for it all now.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like a fool,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBesides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no. I‚Äôll lay you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs shut up about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI laughed about it too, myself, once.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt looking at me. ‚ÄúA friend of my brother‚Äôs came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNobody ever knows anything.‚Äù

I was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very funny. And it‚Äôs a lot of fun, too, to be in love.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think so?‚Äù her eyes looked flat again.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean fun that way. In a way it‚Äôs an enjoyable feeling.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs hell on earth.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt think it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to.‚Äù

We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The driver leaned his head around.

‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù I asked. Brett turned her head away.

‚ÄúOh, go to the Select.‚Äù

‚ÄúCaf√© Select,‚Äù I told the driver. ‚ÄúBoulevard Montparnasse.‚Äù We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the passing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: ‚ÄúWould you mind very much if I asked you to do something?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly.‚Äù

‚ÄúKiss me just once more before we get there.‚Äù

When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her hat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. ‚ÄúI say, do I look too much of a mess?‚Äù She pulled her man‚Äôs felt hat down and started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who had been at the dance.

‚ÄúHello, you chaps,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Brett! Brett!‚Äù the little Greek portrait-painter, who called himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. ‚ÄúI got something fine to tell you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, Zizi,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI want you to meet a friend,‚Äù Zizi said. A fat man came up.

‚ÄúCount Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you do?‚Äù said Brett.

‚ÄúWell, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?‚Äù asked Count Mippipopolous, who wore an elk‚Äôs tooth on his watch-chain.

‚ÄúRather,‚Äù said Brett.

‚ÄúParis is a fine town all right,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúBut I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúEnormous.‚Äù

Braddocks called to me from a table. ‚ÄúBarnes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhave a drink. That girl of yours got in a frightful row.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething the patronne‚Äôs daughter said. A corking row. She was rather splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs too. I say it was a row.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat finally happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI must shove off. Seen Cohn?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe went home with Frances,‚Äù Mrs. Braddock put in.

‚ÄúPoor chap, he looks awfully down,‚Äù Braddocks said.

‚ÄúI dare say he is,‚Äù said Mrs. Braddocks.

‚ÄúI have to shove off,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù

I said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne. ‚ÄúWill you take a glass of wine with us, sir?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúNo. Thanks awfully. I have to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally going?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a rotten headache.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you to-morrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in at the office.‚Äù

‚ÄúHardly.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, where will I see you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnywhere around five o‚Äôclock.‚Äù

‚ÄúMake it the other side of town then.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll be at the Crillon at five.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry and be there,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never let you down, have I?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeard from Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúLetter to-day.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood night, sir,‚Äù said the count.

I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St. Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across the street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the pavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was and went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was deserted. Lavigne‚Äôs was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables outside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney‚Äôs statue standing among the new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple wreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription: from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine, Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green new horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little way down the Boulevard St. Michel.

There was a light in the concierge‚Äôs room and I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There were two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light in the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered I had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement. The other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine‚ÄîI knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town. It was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name like Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the announcement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was funny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell with you, Lady Ashley.

I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide windows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They were noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a typically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other. Le Toril was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.

My head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian hospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was the Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was Zonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was funny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But they had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: ‚ÄúYou, a foreigner, an Englishman‚Äù (any foreigner was an Englishman) ‚Äúhave given more than your life.‚Äù What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my place, I guess. ‚ÄúChe mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!‚Äù

I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn‚Äôt run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose she only wanted what she couldn‚Äôt have. Well, people were that way. To hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.

I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn‚Äôt keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.

I woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The concierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name and called down the stairs.

‚ÄúIs that you, Monsieur Barnes?‚Äù the concierge called.

‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a species of woman here who‚Äôs waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I‚Äôve told her you‚Äôre asleep.‚Äù

Then I heard Brett‚Äôs voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was Georgette. I don‚Äôt know why. She could not have known my address.

‚ÄúWill you send her up, please?‚Äù

Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. ‚ÄúSilly thing to do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMake an awful row. I say, you weren‚Äôt asleep, were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you think I was doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know. What time is it?‚Äù

I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. ‚ÄúHad no idea what hour it was,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI say, can a chap sit down? Don‚Äôt be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he like?‚Äù I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.

‚ÄúJust a little,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try and make me drunk. The count? Oh, rather. He‚Äôs quite one of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he a count?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows hell‚Äôs own amount about people. Don‚Äôt know where he got it all. Owns a chain of sweetshops in the States.‚Äù

She sipped at her glass.

‚ÄúThink he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up. Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He‚Äôs one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell.‚Äù

She took another drink.

‚ÄúHow do I buck on about all this? You don‚Äôt mind, do you? He‚Äôs putting up for Zizi, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs Zizi really a duke, too?‚Äù

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere did you go with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?‚Äù

‚ÄúAround two thousand.‚Äù

‚ÄúLot of money. I told him I couldn‚Äôt do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.‚Äù

Brett laughed.

‚ÄúI say, you are slow on the up-take,‚Äù she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better. Very funny,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúThen he wanted me to go to Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here.‚Äù

She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look like that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTold him I was in love with you. True, too. Don‚Äôt look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to dinner to-morrow night. Like to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd better go now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come down? He‚Äôs got the car just up the street.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe count?‚Äù

‚ÄúHimself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli‚Äôs. Dozen bottles of Mumms. Tempt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to work in the morning,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Send him a tender message?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything. Absolutely.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood night, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sentimental.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou make me ill.‚Äù

We kissed good night and Brett shivered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd better go,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGood night, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door. I went back upstairs and from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a glass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen and poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into bed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.





CHAPTER V


In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the Rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Op√©ra, and up to my office. I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy. Three more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the sidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt pleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office.

Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning‚Äôs work. At eleven o‚Äôclock I went over to the Quai d‚ÄôOrsay in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back. Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d‚ÄôOrsay with Woolsey and Krum.

‚ÄúWhat do you do nights, Jake?‚Äù asked Krum. ‚ÄúI never see you around.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm over in the Quarter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming over some night. The Dingo. That‚Äôs the great place, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. That, or this new dive, the Select.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve meant to get over,‚Äù said Krum. ‚ÄúYou know how it is, though, with a wife and kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlaying any tennis?‚Äù Woolsey asked.

‚ÄúWell, no,‚Äù said Krum. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve played any this year. I‚Äôve tried to get away, but Sundays it‚Äôs always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Englishmen all have Saturday off,‚Äù Woolsey said.

‚ÄúLucky beggars,‚Äù said Krum. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll tell you. Some day I‚Äôm not going to be working for an agency. Then I‚Äôll have plenty of time to get out in the country.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking some about getting a car next year.‚Äù

I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my street,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCome in and have a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, old man,‚Äù Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to file that line he got off this morning.‚Äù

I put a two-franc piece in Krum‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy, Jake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all on the office, anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. I want to get it.‚Äù

I waved good-by. Krum put his head out. ‚ÄúSee you at the lunch on Wednesday.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bet.‚Äù

I went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me. ‚ÄúHello, Jake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGoing out to lunch?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Let me see if there is anything new.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere will we eat?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnywhere.‚Äù

I was looking over my desk. ‚ÄúWhere do you want to eat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about Wetzel‚Äôs? They‚Äôve got good hors d‚Äô≈ìuvres.‚Äù

In the restaurant we ordered hors d‚Äô≈ìuvres and beer. The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold. There were a dozen different dishes of hors d‚Äô≈ìuvres.

‚ÄúHave any fun last night?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the writing going?‚Äù

‚ÄúRotten. I can‚Äôt get this second book going.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat happens to everybody.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sure of that. It gets me worried, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúThought any more about going to South America?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, why don‚Äôt you start off?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrances.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äútake her with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt like it. That isn‚Äôt the sort of thing she likes. She likes a lot of people around.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell her to go to hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve got certain obligations to her.‚Äù

He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring.

‚ÄúWhat do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúHer name‚Äôs Lady Ashley. Brett‚Äôs her own name. She‚Äôs a nice girl,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs getting a divorce and she‚Äôs going to marry Mike Campbell. He‚Äôs over in Scotland now. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a remarkably attractive woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to be absolutely fine and straight.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to describe the quality,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúI suppose it‚Äôs breeding.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sound as though you liked her pretty well.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. I shouldn‚Äôt wonder if I were in love with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a drunk,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in love with Mike Campbell, and she‚Äôs going to marry him. He‚Äôs going to be rich as hell some day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôll ever marry him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I just don‚Äôt believe it. Have you known her a long time?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe must have been just a kid then.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs thirty-four now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen did she marry Ashley?‚Äù

‚ÄúDuring the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou talk sort of bitter.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe she would marry anybody she didn‚Äôt love.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs done it twice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask me a lot of fool questions if you don‚Äôt like the answers.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask you that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask you to insult her.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, go to hell.‚Äù

He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of hors d‚Äô≈ìuvres.

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a fool.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to take that back.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, cut out the prep-school stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not that. About me going to hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt go to hell,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúStick around. We‚Äôre just starting lunch.‚Äù

Cohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the hell would he have done if he hadn‚Äôt sat down? ‚ÄúYou say such damned insulting things, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really about the best friend I have, Jake.‚Äù

God help you, I thought. ‚ÄúForget what I said,‚Äù I said out loud. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right. It‚Äôs fine. I was just sore for a minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Let‚Äôs get something else to eat.‚Äù

After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Caf√© de la Paix and had coffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him off it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to the office.





CHAPTER VI


At five o‚Äôclock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them. Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the Caf√© Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.

The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in doing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let that part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull riding. It was like a certain stretch on the P.L.M. between Fontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read something about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.

The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what caf√© in Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù said Harvey, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing. Just looking for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen out to the races?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not since Sunday.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you hear from the States?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing. Absolutely nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm through with them. I‚Äôm absolutely through with them.‚Äù

He leaned forward and looked me in the eye.

‚ÄúDo you want to know something, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had anything to eat for five days.‚Äù

I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo money. Money hasn‚Äôt come,‚Äù he paused. ‚ÄúI tell you it‚Äôs strange, Jake. When I‚Äôm like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I‚Äôm like a cat.‚Äù

I felt in my pocket.

‚ÄúWould a hundred help you any, Harvey?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs go and eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no hurry. Have a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. When I get like this I don‚Äôt care whether I eat or not.‚Äù

We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.

‚ÄúDo you know Mencken, Harvey?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he like?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. The trouble is,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs a garter snapper.‚Äô That‚Äôs not bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs through now,‚Äù Harvey went on. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs written about all the things he knows, and now he‚Äôs on all the things he doesn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess he‚Äôs all right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt read him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, nobody reads him now,‚Äù Harvey said, ‚Äúexcept the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat was a good thing, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.

‚ÄúHave another port?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù said Harvey.

‚ÄúThere comes Cohn,‚Äù I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.

‚ÄúThat moron,‚Äù said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.

‚ÄúHello, you bums,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúHello, Robert,‚Äù Harvey said. ‚ÄúI was just telling Jake here that you‚Äôre a moron.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell us right off. Don‚Äôt think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?‚Äù

Cohn started to consider.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think. Bring it right out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it all about, anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI misjudged you,‚Äù Harvey said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a moron. You‚Äôre only a case of arrested development.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awfully funny, Harvey,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúSome day somebody will push your face in.‚Äù

Harvey Stone laughed. ‚ÄúYou think so. They won‚Äôt, though. Because it wouldn‚Äôt make any difference to me. I‚Äôm not a fighter.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would make a difference to you if anybody did it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it wouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs where you make your big mistake. Because you‚Äôre not intelligent.‚Äù

‚ÄúCut it out about me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Harvey. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make any difference to me. You don‚Äôt mean anything to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Harvey,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHave another porto.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake.‚Äù

He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.

‚ÄúHe always gets me sore,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fond of him. You don‚Äôt want to get sore at him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúHe just gets on my nerves.‚Äù

‚ÄúWrite this afternoon?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I couldn‚Äôt get it going. It‚Äôs harder to do than my first book. I‚Äôm having a hard time handling it.‚Äù

The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone. Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on the tenniscourt, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not believe he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.

Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Caf√© Select, and Harvey Stone had just crossed the street.

‚ÄúCome on up to the Lilas,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI have a date.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrances is coming here at seven-fifteen.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere she is.‚Äù

Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre here, Jake. I‚Äôve been wanting to talk to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, Frances,‚Äù said Cohn. He smiled.

‚ÄúWhy, hello, Robert. Are you here?‚Äù She went on, talking rapidly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the darndest time. This one‚Äù‚Äîshaking her head at Cohn‚Äî‚Äúdidn‚Äôt come home for lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt supposed to.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I know. But you didn‚Äôt say anything about it to the cook. Then I had a date myself, and Paula wasn‚Äôt at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn‚Äôt have enough money to lunch at the Ritz‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, went out, of course.‚Äù She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. ‚ÄúI always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you like her?‚Äù Cohn asked.

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs perfectly charming. Don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Cohn said nothing.

‚ÄúLook, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You‚Äôll stay here, won‚Äôt you, Robert? Come on, Jake.‚Äù

We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy came up with the Paris Times, and I bought one and opened it.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Frances?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, nothing,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúexcept that he wants to leave me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn‚Äôt want to do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs decided he hasn‚Äôt lived enough. I knew it would happen when he went to New York.‚Äù

She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt marry him if he doesn‚Äôt want to. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we‚Äôve waited three years, and I‚Äôve just gotten my divorce.‚Äù

I said nothing.

‚ÄúWe were going to celebrate so, and instead we‚Äôve just had scenes. It‚Äôs so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rotten luck.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should say it is rotten luck. I‚Äôve wasted two years and a half on him now. And I don‚Äôt know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me. Now I don‚Äôt think I could get anybody.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, you could marry anybody.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt believe it. And I‚Äôm fond of him, too. And I‚Äôd like to have children. I always thought we‚Äôd have children.‚Äù

She looked at me very brightly. ‚ÄúI never liked children much, but I don‚Äôt want to think I‚Äôll never have them. I always thought I‚Äôd have them and then like them.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got children.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes. He‚Äôs got children, and he‚Äôs got money, and he‚Äôs got a rich mother, and he‚Äôs written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff, nobody at all. It isn‚Äôt bad, either. And I haven‚Äôt got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.‚Äù

She looked at me again very brightly.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt right. It‚Äôs my own fault and it‚Äôs not, too. I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can‚Äôt marry. Why can‚Äôt he marry? I‚Äôd be a good wife. I‚Äôm easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn‚Äôt do any good.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rotten shame.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it is a rotten shame. But there‚Äôs no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let‚Äôs go back to the caf√©.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd of course there isn‚Äôt anything I can do.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Just don‚Äôt let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.‚Äù Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. ‚ÄúHe wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That‚Äôs what he wants.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe they won‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that way. Really.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know him like I do, Jake. That‚Äôs what he wants to do. I know it. I know it. That‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to go back to the caf√©?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Come on.‚Äù

We got up from the table‚Äîthey had never brought us a drink‚Äîand started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table.

‚ÄúWell, what are you smiling at?‚Äù Frances asked him. ‚ÄúFeel pretty happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, what I‚Äôve told Jake isn‚Äôt any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was it? About your going to England?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I‚Äôm going to England.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that fine!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs done in the very best families. Robert‚Äôs sending me. He‚Äôs going to give me two hundred pounds and then I‚Äôm going to visit friends. Won‚Äôt it be lovely? The friends don‚Äôt know about it, yet.‚Äù

She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.

‚ÄúYou were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren‚Äôt you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred. He‚Äôs really very generous. Aren‚Äôt you, Robert?‚Äù

I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn. There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later.

‚ÄúHow can you say such things, Frances?‚Äù Cohn interrupted.

‚ÄúListen to him. I‚Äôm going to England. I‚Äôm going to visit friends. Ever visit friends that didn‚Äôt want you? Oh, they‚Äôll have to take me, all right. ‚ÄòHow do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we‚Äôve seen you. And how is your dear mother?‚Äô Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. ‚ÄòAnd what about Robert?‚Äô or else very careful talking around Robert. ‚ÄòYou must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.‚Äô Won‚Äôt it be fun, Robert? Don‚Äôt you think it will be fun, Jake?‚Äù

She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this.

‚ÄúAnd where are you going to be, Robert? It‚Äôs my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you‚Äôd get rid of me the same way. Jake doesn‚Äôt know about that. Should I tell him?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, Frances, for God‚Äôs sake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn‚Äôt even pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn‚Äôt you, Robert?

‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn‚Äôt that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.

‚ÄúYou know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren‚Äôt you, Robert? That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs leaving me. He‚Äôs decided I don‚Äôt film well. You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn‚Äôt remember anything about us. So now he‚Äôs going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.

‚ÄúListen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won‚Äôt mind, will you? Don‚Äôt have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can‚Äôt have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can‚Äôt remember what the other person‚Äôs said. You‚Äôll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it‚Äôs awfully hard. But remember, it‚Äôs for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature. Look at me. I‚Äôm going to England without a protest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don‚Äôt you think so, Jake? But you‚Äôre not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You‚Äôre thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs any good, though. Some of his French friends told him. He doesn‚Äôt read French very well himself. He wasn‚Äôt a good writer like you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn‚Äôt marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I‚Äôve just thought of something.‚Äù She put her gloved hand up to her lips. ‚ÄúI know the real reason why Robert won‚Äôt marry me, Jake. It‚Äôs just come to me. They‚Äôve sent it to me in a vision in the Caf√© Select. Isn‚Äôt it mystic? Some day they‚Äôll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert? I‚Äôll tell you. It‚Äôs so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it. Why, you see, Robert‚Äôs always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn‚Äôt marry me, why, then he‚Äôs had one. She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he‚Äôs always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs bright of me to figure that out? It‚Äôs true, too. Look at him and see if it‚Äôs not. Where are you going, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.‚Äù

Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?

As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it so, Robert?‚Äù Or maybe she did not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.





CHAPTER VII


As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters and a telegram.

‚ÄúHere is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid she leave a card?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas she with a friend of mine?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps, a little‚Äî‚Äù She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to what I tell you. She is tr√®s, tr√®s gentille. She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey did not leave any word?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. They said they would be back in an hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúSend them up when they come.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu‚Äôune, quelqu‚Äôune!‚Äù

The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling concession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse, but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the accent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.

I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge. The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France. I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door. It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of roses.

‚ÄúHello, darling,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to let us in?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on. I was just bathing.‚Äù

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the fortunate man. Bathing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether you like flowers, sir,‚Äù the count said, ‚Äúbut I took the liberty of just bringing these roses.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere, give them to me.‚Äù Brett took them. ‚ÄúGet me some water in this, Jake.‚Äù I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table.

‚ÄúI say. We have had a day.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Did we have one? I must have been blind.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were quite drunk, my dear,‚Äù said the count.

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt I, though? And the count‚Äôs been a brick, absolutely.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got hell‚Äôs own drag with the concierge now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a damned fool.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis,‚Äù she said, and nodded at the count.

‚ÄúI thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wonderful,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHe remembers everything that‚Äôs happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo do you, my dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúFancy,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôd want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúRather.‚Äù

While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?‚Äù

She kissed me coolly on the forehead.

‚ÄúOh, Brett, I love you so much.‚Äù

‚ÄúDarling,‚Äù she said. Then: ‚ÄúDo you want me to send him away?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll send him away.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôll send him away.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt I, though? You stay here. He‚Äôs mad about me, I tell you.‚Äù

She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and sat on the bed.

‚ÄúPoor old darling.‚Äù She stroked my head.

‚ÄúWhat did you say to him?‚Äù I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her.

‚ÄúSent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne.‚Äù

Then later: ‚ÄúDo you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better.‚Äù

‚ÄúLie quiet. He‚Äôs gone to the other side of town.‚Äù

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt we live together, Brett? Couldn‚Äôt we just live together?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôd just tromper you with everybody. You couldn‚Äôt stand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI stand it now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would be different. It‚Äôs my fault, Jake. It‚Äôs the way I‚Äôm made.‚Äù

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt we go off in the country for a while?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be any good. I‚Äôll go if you like. But I couldn‚Äôt live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it rotten? There isn‚Äôt any use my telling you I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not talk. Talking‚Äôs all bilge. I‚Äôm going away from you, and then Michael‚Äôs coming back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you going away?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter for you. Better for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen are you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúSoon as I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúSan Sebastian.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we go together?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. That would be a hell of an idea after we‚Äôd just talked it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe never agreed.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you know as well as I do. Don‚Äôt be obstinate, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm just low, and when I‚Äôm low I talk like a fool.‚Äù

I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I stood up.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look like that, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you want me to look?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be a fool. I‚Äôm going away to-morrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo-morrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Didn‚Äôt I say so? I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a drink, then. The count will be back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. He should be back. You know he‚Äôs extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him.‚Äù

We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I went to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne.

‚ÄúWhere should I have him put it, sir?‚Äù asked the count.

‚ÄúIn the kitchen,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúPut it in there, Henry,‚Äù the count motioned. ‚ÄúNow go down and get the ice.‚Äù He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll find that‚Äôs very good wine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know we don‚Äôt get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that‚Äôs in the business.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you always have some one in the trade,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúThis fellow raises the grapes. He‚Äôs got thousands of acres of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his name?‚Äù asked Brett. ‚ÄúVeuve Cliquot?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúMumms. He‚Äôs a baron.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it wonderful,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúWe all have titles. Why haven‚Äôt you a title, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI assure you, sir,‚Äù the count put his hand on my arm. ‚ÄúIt never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs damned useful sometimes,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known it to do me any good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt used it properly. I‚Äôve had hell‚Äôs own amount of credit on mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo sit down, count,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet me take that stick.‚Äù

The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gaslight. She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it. ‚ÄúI say, Jake, I don‚Äôt want to ruin your rugs. Can‚Äôt you give a chap an ash-tray?‚Äù

I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice. ‚ÄúPut two bottles in it, Henry,‚Äù the count called.

‚ÄúAnything else, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Wait down in the car.‚Äù He turned to Brett and to me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you like,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt eat a thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI always like a good meal,‚Äù said the count.

‚ÄúShould I bring the wine in, sir?‚Äù asked the chauffeur.

‚ÄúYes. Bring it in, Henry,‚Äù said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me. ‚ÄúLike to try a real American cigar?‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll finish the cigarette.‚Äù

He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain.

‚ÄúI like a cigar to really draw,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúHalf the cigars you smoke don‚Äôt draw.‚Äù

He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. ‚ÄúAnd when you‚Äôre divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won‚Äôt have a title.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. What a pity.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a title. You got class all over you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks. Awfully decent of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking you,‚Äù the count blew a cloud of smoke. ‚ÄúYou got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice of you,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúMummy would be pleased. Couldn‚Äôt you write it out, and I‚Äôll send it in a letter to her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd tell her, too,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That‚Äôs what I always say.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre terribly right. I always joke people and I haven‚Äôt a friend in the world. Except Jake here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt joke him.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you, now?‚Äù asked the count. ‚ÄúDo you joke him?‚Äù

Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt joke him.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt joke him.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a hell of a dull talk,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHow about some of that champagne?‚Äù

The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt cold, yet. You‚Äôre always drinking, my dear. Why don‚Äôt you just talk?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked too ruddy much. I‚Äôve talked myself all out to Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave ‚Äôem for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a very interesting system,‚Äù the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. ‚ÄúStill I would like to hear you talk some time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he a fool?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù the count brought up a bottle. ‚ÄúI think this is cool.‚Äù

I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. ‚ÄúI like to drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool.‚Äù He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the glasses.

‚ÄúI say. You might open it,‚Äù Brett suggested.

‚ÄúYes, my dear. Now I‚Äôll open it.‚Äù

It was amazing champagne.

‚ÄúI say that is wine,‚Äù Brett held up her glass. ‚ÄúWe ought to toast something. ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs to royalty.‚Äô ‚Äù

‚ÄúThis wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don‚Äôt want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste.‚Äù

Brett‚Äôs glass was empty.

‚ÄúYou ought to write a book on wines, count,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúMr. Barnes,‚Äù answered the count, ‚Äúall I want out of wines is to enjoy them.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs enjoy a little more of this,‚Äù Brett pushed her glass forward. The count poured very carefully. ‚ÄúThere, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrunk? Drunk?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dear, you are charming when you are drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen to the man.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Barnes,‚Äù the count poured my glass full. ‚ÄúShe is the only lady I have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was sober.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt been around much, have you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrink your wine,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been around. I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt think so, sir. I have seen a lot, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you have, my dear,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI was only ragging.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have been in seven wars and four revolutions,‚Äù the count said.

‚ÄúSoldiering?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúSometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a look at them.‚Äù

The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. He pulled up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big stomach muscles bulging under the light.

‚ÄúYou see them?‚Äù

Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts. ‚ÄúSee on the back where they come out.‚Äù Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger.

‚ÄúI say. Those are something.‚Äù

‚ÄúClean through.‚Äù

The count was tucking in his shirt.

‚ÄúWhere did you get those?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúIn Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat were you doing?‚Äù asked Brett. ‚ÄúWere you in the army?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was on a business trip, my dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you he was one of us. Didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù Brett turned to me. ‚ÄúI love you, count. You‚Äôre a darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou make me very happy, my dear. But it isn‚Äôt true.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don‚Äôt you find it like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Absolutely.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúThat is the secret. You must get to know the values.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt anything ever happen to your values?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúNo. Not any more.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever fall in love?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúI am always in love.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that do to your values?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat, too, has got a place in my values.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt any values. You‚Äôre dead, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, my dear. You‚Äôre not right. I‚Äôm not dead at all.‚Äù

We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in my kitchen. We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner. Food had an excellent place in the count‚Äôs values. So did wine. The count was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good party.

‚ÄúWhere would you like to go?‚Äù asked the count after dinner. We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home.

‚ÄúWe might go up on the hill,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt we had a splendid party?‚Äù

The count was beaming. He was very happy.

‚ÄúYou are very nice people,‚Äù he said. He was smoking a cigar again. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you get married, you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe want to lead our own lives,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWe have our careers,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs get out of this.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave another brandy,‚Äù the count said.

‚ÄúGet it on the hill.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Have it here where it is quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your quiet,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúWhat is it men feel about quiet?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe like it,‚Äù said the count. ‚ÄúLike you like noise, my dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have one.‚Äù

‚ÄúSommelier!‚Äù the count called.

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is the oldest brandy you have?‚Äù

‚ÄúEighteen eleven, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúBring us a bottle.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say. Don‚Äôt be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in any other antiquities.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot many antiquities?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got a houseful.‚Äù

Finally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli‚Äôs it was crowded, smoky, and noisy. The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was so crowded we could barely move. The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We were caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him.

‚ÄúHahre you?‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThaats good.‚Äù

He was all teeth and lips.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great friend of mine,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúDamn good drummer.‚Äù

The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat. Then the music started again and we danced. I looked at the count. He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go over.‚Äù

Brett started toward the table. The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd.

‚ÄúYou are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael‚Äôs the best dancer I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs splendid.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got his points.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm damned fond of him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry him,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúFunny. I haven‚Äôt thought about him for a week.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you write him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot I. Never write letters.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet he writes to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúRather. Damned good letters, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen are you going to get married?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael‚Äôs trying to get his mother to put up for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an ass. Michael‚Äôs people have loads of money.‚Äù

The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up.

‚ÄúVery nice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou looked very, very nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dance, count?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm too old.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, come off it,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúMy dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance.‚Äù

‚ÄúSplendid,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, Zizi?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me tell you. I support that boy, but I don‚Äôt want to have him around.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is rather hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I think that boy‚Äôs got a future. But personally I don‚Äôt want him around.‚Äù

‚ÄúJake‚Äôs rather the same way.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe gives me the willys.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù the count shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúAbout his future you can‚Äôt ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs dance,‚Äù Brett said.

We danced. It was crowded and close.

‚ÄúOh, darling,‚Äù Brett said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so miserable.‚Äù

I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before. ‚ÄúYou were happy a minute ago.‚Äù

The drummer shouted: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt two time‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I just feel terribly.‚Äù

‚Äú . . . . . . ‚Äù the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks.

‚ÄúWant to go?‚Äù

I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again.

‚Äú . . . . . . ‚Äù the drummer sang softly.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

‚Äú . . . . . . ‚Äù the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the dressing-room.

‚ÄúBrett wants to go,‚Äù I said to the count. He nodded. ‚ÄúDoes she? That‚Äôs fine. You take the car. I‚Äôm going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes.‚Äù

We shook hands.

‚ÄúIt was a wonderful time,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI wish you would let me get this.‚Äù I took a note out of my pocket.

‚ÄúMr. Barnes, don‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù the count said.

Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.

‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt come up,‚Äù she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Please.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood night, Brett,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel rotten.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won‚Äôt see you again.‚Äù We kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt!‚Äù Brett said.

She turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me around to my flat. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and said: ‚ÄúGood night, sir,‚Äù and drove off. I rang the bell. The door opened and I went up-stairs and went to bed.

CHAPTER VIII


I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One card came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said: ‚ÄúDarling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT.‚Äù

Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a couple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach him always, he wrote, through his bankers.

Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn‚Äôs troubles, I rather enjoyed not having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of June. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful. New York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a whole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to make a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he went off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He wrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: ‚ÄúJake, Budapest is wonderful.‚Äù Then I got a wire: ‚ÄúBack on Monday.‚Äù

Monday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying his bags. I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI hear you had a wonderful trip.‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBudapest is absolutely wonderful.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about Vienna?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you mean?‚Äù I was getting glasses and a siphon.

‚ÄúTight, Jake. I was tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs strange. Better have a drink.‚Äù

Bill rubbed his forehead. ‚ÄúRemarkable thing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know how it happened. Suddenly it happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúLast long?‚Äù

‚ÄúFour days, Jake. Lasted just four days.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot so sure. Possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on. Tell me about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt remember. Tell you anything I could remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on. Take that drink and remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúMight remember a little,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúRemember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big. All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger‚Äôd just knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a speech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn‚Äôt get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúLoaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get his money. Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall. Wonder who translated? Was it me?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably it wasn‚Äôt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. Wasn‚Äôt me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you come out?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger promised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can‚Äôt knock out Vienna boy in Vienna. ‚ÄòMy God, Mister Gorton,‚Äô said nigger, ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay. That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit him.‚Äô ‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you get any money?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo money, Jake. All we could get was nigger‚Äôs clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not so good, Jake. Not so good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat became of the nigger?‚Äù

‚ÄúWent back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou probably did.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, anyway, let‚Äôs eat,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúUnless you want me to tell you some more travel stories.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat.‚Äù

We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm June evening.

‚ÄúWhere will we go?‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to eat on the island?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes.

‚ÄúI know who they are.‚Äù Bill eyed the monument. ‚ÄúGentlemen who invented pharmacy. Don‚Äôt try and fool me on Paris.‚Äù

We went on.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a taxidermist‚Äôs,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúWant to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pie-eyed.‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty nice stuffed dogs,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúCertainly brighten up your flat.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one stuffed dog. I can take ‚Äôem or leave ‚Äôem alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

‚ÄúMean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get one on the way back.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with un-bought stuffed dogs. Not my fault.‚Äù

We went on.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you feel that way about dogs so sudden?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals.‚Äù

We stopped and had a drink.

‚ÄúCertainly like to drink,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúYou ought to try it some times, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOught not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere were you drinking?‚Äù

‚ÄúStopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George‚Äôs a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be daunted after about three more pernods.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot in public. If I begin to feel daunted I‚Äôll go off by myself. I‚Äôm like a cat that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen did you see Harvey Stone?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn‚Äôt eaten for three days. Doesn‚Äôt eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúSplendid. Wish he wouldn‚Äôt keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll we do to-night?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt make any difference. Only let‚Äôs not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn‚Äôt have to go all the way down to the island to eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúNix,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have a regular meal.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a suggestion,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúWant to start now?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill looked at it.

‚ÄúSee that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I‚Äôm a nature-writer.‚Äù

A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett.

‚ÄúBeautiful lady,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúGoing to kidnap us.‚Äù

‚ÄúHullo!‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHullo!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley.‚Äù

Brett smiled at Bill. ‚ÄúI say I‚Äôm just back. Haven‚Äôt bathed even. Michael comes in to-night.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Come on and eat with us, and we‚Äôll all go to meet him.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust clean myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, rot! Come on.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust bathe. He doesn‚Äôt get in till nine.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome and have a drink, then, before you bathe.‚Äù

‚ÄúMight do that. Now you‚Äôre not talking rot.‚Äù

We got in the taxi. The driver looked around.

‚ÄúStop at the nearest bistro,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWe might as well go to the Closerie,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt drink these rotten brandies.‚Äù

‚ÄúCloserie des Lilas.‚Äù

Brett turned to Bill.

‚ÄúHave you been in this pestilential city long?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust got in to-day from Budapest.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow was Budapest?‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful. Budapest was wonderful.‚Äù

‚ÄúAsk him about Vienna.‚Äù

‚ÄúVienna,‚Äù said Bill, ‚Äúis a strange city.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery much like Paris,‚Äù Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes.

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúVery much like Paris at this moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have a good start.‚Äù

Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod.

‚ÄúHow are you, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a good time.‚Äù

Brett looked at me. ‚ÄúI was a fool to go away,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs an ass to leave Paris.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you have a good time?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee anybody?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, hardly anybody. I never went out.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you swim?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Didn‚Äôt do a thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like Vienna,‚Äù Bill said.

Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the way it was in Vienna.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was like everything in Vienna.‚Äù

Brett smiled at him again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve a nice friend, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a taxidermist.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was in another country,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúAnd besides all the animals were dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne more,‚Äù Brett said, ‚Äúand I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a line of them. Right out in front.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

We had the drink and put Brett into her taxi.

‚ÄúMind you‚Äôre at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be there,‚Äù Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved.

‚ÄúQuite a girl,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs damned nice. Who‚Äôs Michael?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe man she‚Äôs going to marry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs always just the stage I meet anybody. What‚Äôll I send them? Think they‚Äôd like a couple of stuffed race-horses?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe better eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs she really Lady something or other?‚Äù Bill asked in the taxi on our way down to the Ile Saint Louis.

‚ÄúOh, yes. In the stud-book and everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, well.‚Äù

We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte‚Äôs restaurant on the far side of the island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place. Some one had put it in the American Women‚Äôs Club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte made a great fuss over seeing him.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt get us a table, though,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúGrand woman, though.‚Äù

We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a salad, and some apple-pie and cheese.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the world here all right,‚Äù Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She raised her hand. ‚ÄúOh, my God!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be rich.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope so.‚Äù

After the coffee and a fine we got the bill, chalked up the same as ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the ‚Äúquaint‚Äù features, paid it, shook hands, and went out.

‚ÄúYou never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes,‚Äù Madame Lecomte said.

‚ÄúToo many compatriots.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome at lunch-time. It‚Äôs not crowded then.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll be down soon.‚Äù

We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai d‚ÄôOrl√©ans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of old houses that were being torn down.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to cut a street through.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey would,‚Äù Bill said.

We walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting against the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees were shadows.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty grand,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúGod, I love to get back.‚Äù

We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to the lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It made no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed us. They were walking with their arms around each other.

We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the door of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Caf√© Aux Amateurs I saw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking potatochips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand.

‚ÄúWant to have a drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it.‚Äù

We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth narrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses jutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val de Gr√¢ce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal.

‚ÄúWhat do you want to do?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúGo up to the caf√© and see Brett and Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne‚Äôs, and all the little caf√©s, Damoy‚Äôs, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.

Michael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and healthy-looking.

‚ÄúHel-lo, Jake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look very fit, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I am. I‚Äôm frightfully fit. I‚Äôve done nothing but walk. Walk all day long. One drink a day with my mother at tea.‚Äù

Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. She had no stockings on.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you, Jake,‚Äù Michael said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little tight you know. Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? Did you see my nose?‚Äù

There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.

‚ÄúAn old lady‚Äôs bags did that,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI reached up to help her with them and they fell on me.‚Äù

Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and wrinkled the corners of her eyes.

‚ÄúAn old lady,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúHer bags fell on me. Let‚Äôs go in and see Brett. I say, she is a piece. You are a lovely lady, Brett. Where did you get that hat?‚Äù

‚ÄúChap bought it for me. Don‚Äôt you like it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôve so much money now,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI say, haven‚Äôt you met Bill yet? You are a lovely host, Jake.‚Äù

She turned to Mike. ‚ÄúThis is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike Campbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.‚Äù

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London. Chap who did me in.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù

‚ÄúBought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece. Don‚Äôt you think she‚Äôs beautiful?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeautiful. With this nose?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn‚Äôt she a lovely piece?‚Äù

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt we have kept the man in Scotland?‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, Brett, let‚Äôs turn in early.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she a lovely piece? Don‚Äôt you think so, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fight to-night,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúLike to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúFight,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs fighting?‚Äù

‚ÄúLedoux and somebody.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very good, Ledoux,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see it, rather‚Äù‚Äîhe was making an effort to pull himself together‚Äî‚Äúbut I can‚Äôt go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat.‚Äù

Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from under it. ‚ÄúYou two run along to the fight. I‚Äôll have to be taking Mr. Campbell home directly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tight,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúPerhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on to the fight,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúMr. Campbell‚Äôs getting difficult. What are these outbursts of affection, Michael?‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, you are a lovely piece.‚Äù

We said good night. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt go,‚Äù Mike said. Brett laughed. I looked back from the door. Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning toward Brett, talking. Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the corners of her eyes were smiling.

Outside on the pavement I said: ‚ÄúDo you want to go to the fight?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt have to walk.‚Äù

‚ÄúMike was pretty excited about his girl friend,‚Äù I said in the taxi.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt blame him such a hell of a lot.‚Äù





CHAPTER IX


The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a good fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn, written from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing, playing some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down? If I would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.

That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would leave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him at Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona. The same evening about seven o‚Äôclock I stopped in at the Select to see Michael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo. They were inside sitting at the bar.

‚ÄúHello, darling.‚Äù Brett put out her hand.

‚ÄúHello, Jake,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI understand I was tight last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you, though,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúDisgraceful business.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Mike, ‚Äúwhen do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we came down with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be grand.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt mind, really? I‚Äôve been at Pamplona, you know. Brett‚Äôs mad to go. You‚Äôre sure we wouldn‚Äôt just be a bloody nuisance?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like a fool.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little tight, you know. I wouldn‚Äôt ask you like this if I weren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre sure you don‚Äôt mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, shut up, Michael,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHow can the man say he‚Äôd mind now? I‚Äôll ask him later.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt mind, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go down on the morning of the 25th.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the way, where is Bill?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs out at Chantilly dining with some people.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good chap.‚Äù

‚ÄúSplendid chap,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúHe is, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember him,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we‚Äôll come down the night of the 25th. Brett can‚Äôt get up in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed not!‚Äù

‚ÄúIf our money comes and you‚Äôre sure you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt will come, all right. I‚Äôll see to that.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me what tackle to send for.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt fish,‚Äù Brett put in.

‚ÄúGet two rods, then, and Bill won‚Äôt have to buy one.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send a wire to the keeper.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt it be splendid,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúSpain! We will have fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe 25th. When is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSaturday.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will have to get ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say,‚Äù said Mike, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the barber‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must bathe,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúWalk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a good chap.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have got the loveliest hotel,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a brothel!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night.‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs a brothel,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúAnd I should know.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, shut it and go and get your hair cut.‚Äù

Mike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar.

‚ÄúHave another?‚Äù

‚ÄúMight.‚Äù

‚ÄúI needed that,‚Äù Brett said.

We walked up the Rue Delambre.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you since I‚Äôve been back,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Brett looked at me. ‚ÄúI say,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis Robert Cohn going on this trip?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think it will be a bit rough on him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I said.

We walked along.

‚ÄúWhat did you say that for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. What would you like me to say?‚Äù

We walked along and turned a corner.

‚ÄúHe behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes he?‚Äù

‚ÄúI rather thought it would be good for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou might take up social service.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be nasty.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you really know?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI guess I didn‚Äôt think about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think it will be too rough on him?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs up to him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTell him you‚Äôre coming. He can always not come.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it.‚Äù

I did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June.

‚ÄúDid you hear from Cohn?‚Äù

‚ÄúRather. He‚Äôs keen about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy God!‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought it was rather odd myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúSays he can‚Äôt wait to see me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes he think you‚Äôre coming alone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wonderful.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he?‚Äù

They expected their money the next day. We arranged to meet at Pamplona. They would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there. We would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the mountains, to start fishing. There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us.

Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d‚ÄôOrsay. It was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went back into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked the conductor for tickets for the first service.

‚ÄúNothing until the fifth.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù

There were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and always plenty of places for both of them.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all reserved,‚Äù the dining-car conductor said. ‚ÄúThere will be a fifth service at three-thirty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is serious,‚Äù I said to Bill.

‚ÄúGive him ten francs.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe want to eat in the first service.‚Äù

The conductor put the ten francs in his pocket.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll go a long way, brother,‚Äù Bill said to him in English. ‚ÄúI suppose if I‚Äôd given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train.‚Äù

‚ÄúComment?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to hell!‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúGet the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine. You tell him, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd send it up to the next car.‚Äù I described where we were.

In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son.

‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre Americans, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù the man asked. ‚ÄúHaving a good trip?‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful,‚Äù said Bill.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you want to do. Travel while you‚Äôre young. Mother and I always wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could have come over ten years ago, if you‚Äôd wanted to,‚Äù the wife said. ‚ÄúWhat you always said was: ‚ÄòSee America first!‚Äô I will say we‚Äôve seen a good deal, take it one way and another.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay, there‚Äôs plenty of Americans on this train,‚Äù the husband said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They‚Äôve been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they‚Äôre going down to Biarritz and Lourdes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, that‚Äôs what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúWhat part of the States you boys from?‚Äù

‚ÄúKansas City,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs from Chicago.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou both going to Biarritz?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. We‚Äôre going fishing in Spain.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I never cared for it, myself. There‚Äôs plenty that do out where I come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana. I‚Äôve been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any.‚Äù

‚ÄúMighty little fishing you did on them trips,‚Äù his wife said.

He winked at us.

‚ÄúYou know how the ladies are. If there‚Äôs a jug goes along, or a case of beer, they think it‚Äôs hell and damnation.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way men are,‚Äù his wife said to us. She smoothed her comfortable lap. ‚ÄúI voted against prohibition to please him, and because I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It‚Äôs a wonder they ever find any one to marry them.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay,‚Äù said Bill, ‚Äúdo you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you mean? They can‚Äôt do a thing like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou try and get seats.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another breakfast.‚Äù

She stood up and straightened her dress.

‚ÄúWill you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert.‚Äù

They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our friend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to work to-day,‚Äù I said.

He nodded his head. ‚ÄúThey start now, at ten-thirty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen do we eat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh! When do I eat?‚Äù

He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches and tipped him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the plates,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúor bring them with you.‚Äù

We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.

At Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably.

‚ÄúIs there good swimming in Biarritz?‚Äù asked Hubert.

‚ÄúThat boy‚Äôs just crazy till he can get in the water,‚Äù his mother said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty hard on youngsters travelling.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs good swimming,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs dangerous when it‚Äôs rough.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you get a meal?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúWe sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey thought we were snappers, all right,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúIt certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It‚Äôs a pity you boys ain‚Äôt Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes me so sore.‚Äù

Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather difficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims.

‚ÄúWhen do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about it. Haven‚Äôt you got tickets?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough to make a man join the Klan,‚Äù Bill said. The priest looked back at him.

Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table d‚Äôh√¥te meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white jacket was purple under the arms.

‚ÄúHe must drink a lot of wine.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr wear purple undershirts.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ask him.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs too tired.‚Äù

The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through the station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town. Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It was all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the window, and about nine o‚Äôclock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife and Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to change for Biarritz.

‚ÄúWell, I hope you have lots of luck,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBe careful about those bull-fights.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll see you at Biarritz,‚Äù Hubert said.

We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses. There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see us at first. Then he started forward.

‚ÄúHello, Jake. Have a good trip?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis is Bill Gorton.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù said Robert. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a cab.‚Äù He was a little nearsighted. I had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make him out. He was shy, too.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go up to my hotel. It‚Äôs all right. It‚Äôs quite nice.‚Äù

We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark bridge and into the town.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm awfully glad to meet you,‚Äù Robert said to Bill. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard so much about you from Jake and I‚Äôve read your books. Did you get my line, Jake?‚Äù

The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we each had a good small room.





CHAPTER X


In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of the town, and we all had breakfast in a caf√©. Bayonne is a nice town. It is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.

I was not at all sure Mike‚Äôs rods would come from Scotland in time, so we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs over a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.

We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d‚ÄôInitiative office, where the bus was supposed to start from. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1 st of July. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the caf√© on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the caf√©. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the caf√©. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.

Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we started off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back toward the sea. You couldn‚Äôt see the sea. It was too far away. You could see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.

We crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge, and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in and looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of the line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not many.

I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn‚Äôt care for it.

Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.

The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter with the old one?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt got any passport.‚Äù

I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me.

‚ÄúWhat will he do?‚Äù I asked.

The guard spat in the dust.

‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôll just wade across the stream.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have much smuggling?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthey go through.‚Äù

The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.

After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head. Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched out white across the plain going toward Pamplona.

We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside the old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.

The driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the square. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.

There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the second floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early in the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in Spain was always a shock with the hors d‚Äô≈ìuvres, an egg course, two meat courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink plenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him, and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate of cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúBrett and Mike ought to get in to-night.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll come,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúOf course they‚Äôll come.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always late,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI rather think they‚Äôre not coming,‚Äù Robert Cohn said.

He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet you fifty pesetas they‚Äôre here to-night,‚Äù Bill said. He always bets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúGood. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember it myself,‚Äù Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sure thing they‚Äôll come,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut maybe not tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to call it off?‚Äù Cohn asked.

‚ÄúNo. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right. I‚Äôll take that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOr you‚Äôll have to make a book and give me some of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm satisfied,‚Äù Cohn said. He smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll probably win it back at bridge, anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt got it yet,‚Äù Bill said.

We went out to walk around under the arcade to the Caf√© Iru√±a for coffee. Cohn said he was going over and get a shave.

‚ÄúSay,‚Äù Bill said to me, ‚Äúhave I got any chance on that bet?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a rotten chance. They‚Äôve never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn‚Äôt come it‚Äôs a cinch they won‚Äôt get in tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He‚Äôs all right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here.‚Äù

I saw Cohn coming over across the square.

‚ÄúHere he comes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, let him not get superior and Jewish.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe barber shop‚Äôs closed,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not open till four.‚Äù

We had coffee at the Iru√±a, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking out from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I sat out in front of the caf√© and then went for a walk in the town. It was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went through the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat.

‚ÄúYou must have been in a motor-car,‚Äù he said.

The back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray with dust.

‚ÄúFrom Bayonne.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI knew you were in a motor-car from the way the dust was.‚Äù So I gave him two copper coins.

At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it. The first time I ever saw it I thought the facade was ugly but I liked it now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and myself, and all the bullfighters, separately for the ones I liked, and lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that we would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn‚Äôt seen him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.

At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to help him any. The train was due in at nine o‚Äôclock from San Sebastian, and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty minutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from the table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with him, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave his dinner. I said we would be right back.

We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn‚Äôs nervousness. I hoped Brett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn‚Äînor as eager. I was enjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.

After a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side of the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill. We went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of the gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started coming out through the gates.

They were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through and out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were walking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town.

‚ÄúI knew they wouldn‚Äôt come,‚Äù Robert said. We were going back to the hotel.

‚ÄúI thought they might,‚Äù I said.

Bill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt come, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?‚Äù Bill asked. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt changed any money here yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, forget about it,‚Äù Robert Cohn said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs bet on something else. Can you bet on bull-fights?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could,‚Äù Bill said, ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt need to.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be like betting on the war,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need any economic interest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very curious to see them,‚Äù Robert said.

Montoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for you.‚Äù He handed it to me.

It read: ‚ÄúStopped night San Sebastian.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from them,‚Äù I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should have handed it over.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve stopped over in San Sebastian,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSend their regards to you.‚Äù

Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know. I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact that I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly did hate him. I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that little spell of superiority at lunch‚Äîthat and when he went through all that barbering. So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to me, anyway.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They can follow us if they get in to-morrow night.‚Äù

There were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train and the one we had just met.

‚ÄúThat sounds like a good idea,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúThe sooner we get on the stream the better.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all one to me when we start,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThe sooner the better.‚Äù

We sat in the Iru√±a for a while and had coffee and then took a little walk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at the edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I turned in early. Bill and Cohn stayed out in the caf√© quite late, I believe, because I was asleep when they came in.

In the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete. It was scheduled to leave at two o‚Äôclock. There was nothing earlier. I was sitting over at the Iru√±a reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn coming across the square. He came up to the table and sat down in one of the wicker chairs.

‚ÄúThis is a comfortable caf√©,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDid you have a good night, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI slept like a log.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere. And after it shut we went over to that other caf√©. The old man there speaks German and English.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Caf√© Suizo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it‚Äôs a better caf√© than this one.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so good in the daytime,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúToo hot. By the way, I got the bus tickets.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your ticket.‚Äù

‚ÄúGive it to me. I‚Äôll get the money back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs five pesetas.‚Äù

Robert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me.

‚ÄúI ought to stay,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou see I‚Äôm afraid there‚Äôs some sort of misunderstanding.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey may not come here for three or four days now if they start on parties at San Sebastian.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just it,‚Äù said Robert. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid they expected to meet me at San Sebastian, and that‚Äôs why they stopped over.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you think that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I wrote suggesting it to Brett.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy in hell didn‚Äôt you stay there and meet them, then?‚Äù I started to say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did.

He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between him and Brett.

‚ÄúWell, Bill and I will go up right after lunch,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI wish I could go. We‚Äôve been looking forward to this fishing all winter.‚Äù He was being sentimental about it. ‚ÄúBut I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I‚Äôll bring them right up.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find Bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to go over to the barber-shop.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you at lunch.‚Äù

I found Bill up in his room. He was shaving.

‚ÄúOh, yes, he told me all about it last night,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great little confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lying bastard!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get sore. Don‚Äôt get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rub it in.‚Äù

Bill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the mirror while he lathered his face.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank God, I‚Äôm a travelling man. Haven‚Äôt you got some more Jewish friends you could bring along?‚Äù He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and then started scraping again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some fine ones yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes. I‚Äôve got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn. The funny thing is he‚Äôs nice, too. I like him. But he‚Äôs just so awful.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe can be damn nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it. That‚Äôs the terrible part.‚Äù

I laughed.

‚ÄúYes. Go on and laugh,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt out with him last night until two o‚Äôclock.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas he very bad?‚Äù

‚ÄúAwful. What‚Äôs all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?‚Äù

He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side.

‚ÄúSure. She went down to San Sebastian with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe wanted to get out of town and she can‚Äôt go anywhere alone. She said she thought it would be good for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat bloody-fool things people do. Why didn‚Äôt she go off with some of her own people? Or you?‚Äù‚Äîhe slurred that over‚Äî‚Äúor me? Why not me?‚Äù He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honest face. It‚Äôs a face any woman would be safe with.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôd never seen it.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe should have. All women should see it. It‚Äôs a face that ought to be thrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a copy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their daughters about this face. My son‚Äù‚Äîhe pointed the razor at me‚Äî‚Äúgo west with this face and grow up with the country.‚Äù

He ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some alcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down his long upper lip.

‚ÄúMy God!‚Äù he said, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it an awful face?‚Äù

He looked in the glass.

‚ÄúAnd as for this Robert Cohn,‚Äù Bill said, ‚Äúhe makes me sick, and he can go to hell, and I‚Äôm damn glad he‚Äôs staying here so we won‚Äôt have him fishing with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre damn right.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going trout-fishing. We‚Äôre going trout-fishing in the Irati River, and we‚Äôre going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the country, and then take a swell bus ride.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs go over to the Iru√±a and start,‚Äù I said.





CHAPTER XI


It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.

Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us to start. A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it. The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills.

Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head.

‚ÄúPretty nice, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúThese Basques are swell people,‚Äù Bill said.

The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather. He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand. He shoved the wine-bag up.

‚ÄúArriba! Arriba!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLift it up.‚Äù

Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.

‚ÄúNo! No!‚Äù several Basques said. ‚ÄúNot like that.‚Äù One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms‚Äô length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù the owner of the bottle shouted. ‚ÄúWhose wine is that?‚Äù

The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes. Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly.

We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.

We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses.

The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into the posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods.

We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.

Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus. There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off.

The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills again. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Americans?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI been there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúForty years ago.‚Äù

He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard.

‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow was America?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I was in California. It was fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you leave?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you come back here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she don‚Äôt like to travel. Where you from?‚Äù

‚ÄúKansas City.‚Äù

‚ÄúI been there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City.‚Äù

He named them carefully.

‚ÄúHow long were you over?‚Äù

‚ÄúFifteen years. Then I come back and got married.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave a drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get this in America, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty if you can pay for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you come over here for?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to the fiesta at Pamplona.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou like the bull-fights?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. Don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI guess I like them.‚Äù

Then after a little:

‚ÄúWhere you go now?‚Äù

‚ÄúUp to Burguete to fish.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI hope you catch something.‚Äù

He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other Basques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me when I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking American seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.

The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metalsheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Roncevaux,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúWay off there where the mountain starts.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold up here,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs high,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt must be twelve hundred metres.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awful cold,‚Äù Bill said.

The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to Burguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no side-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus stopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the rod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps came up.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in there?‚Äù he pointed to the rod-case.

I opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I got them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on.

‚ÄúIs that all right?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes. Of course.‚Äù

We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.

The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands with us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again. It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of Nuestra Se√±ora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the shutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were all up and it was so cold you could see your breath.

‚ÄúMy God!‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be this cold to-morrow. I‚Äôm not going to wade a stream in this weather.‚Äù

There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play.

‚ÄúI got to keep warm,‚Äù he said.

I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.

‚ÄúTwelve pesetas.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, we only paid that in Pamplona.‚Äù

She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too much,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt pay more than that at a big hotel.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve put in a bathroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you got anything cheaper?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot in the summer. Now is the big season.‚Äù

We were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it‚Äôs only a few days.

‚ÄúIs the wine included?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right.‚Äù

I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I looked at them all. Bill was still playing. ‚ÄúHow about a hot rum punch?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt going to keep me warm permanently.‚Äù

I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it. In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the room. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind.

‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt too much rum in that.‚Äù

I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher.

‚ÄúDirect action,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúIt beats legislation.‚Äù

The girl came in and laid the table for supper.

‚ÄúIt blows like hell up here,‚Äù Bill said.

The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it. The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles.

After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm. Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be warm and in bed.





CHAPTER XII


When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof cracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days before the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to the roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below and when I waved at him he bounded down.

Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the. hall, and went down-stairs. No one was stirring downstairs, so I unbolted the door and went out. It was cool outside in the early morning and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died down. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for bait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and loosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many. Digging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins with worms and sifted dirt onto them. The goats watched me dig.

When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I asked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. Bill was awake and sitting on the edge of the bed.

‚ÄúI saw you out of the window,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt want to interrupt you. What were you doing? Burying your money?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou lazy bum!‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGet up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Get up? I never get up.‚Äù

He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin.

‚ÄúTry and argue me into getting up.‚Äù

I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the tackle-bag.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you interested?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going down and eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúEat? Why didn‚Äôt you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for fun. Eat? Fine. Now you‚Äôre reasonable. You go out and dig some more worms and I‚Äôll be right down.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, go to hell!‚Äù

‚ÄúWork for the good of all.‚Äù Bill stepped into his underclothes. ‚ÄúShow irony and pity.‚Äù

I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the rod-case.

‚ÄúHey! come back!‚Äù

I put my head in the door.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to show a little irony and pity?‚Äù

I thumbed my nose.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not irony.‚Äù

As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, ‚ÄúIrony and Pity. When you‚Äôre feeling . . . Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them Irony. When they‚Äôre feeling . . . Just a little irony. Just a little pity . . . ‚Äù He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was: ‚ÄúThe Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal.‚Äù I was reading a week-old Spanish paper.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this irony and pity?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Don‚Äôt you know about Irony and Pity?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Who got it up?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverybody. They‚Äôre mad about it in New York. It‚Äôs just like the Fratellinis used to be.‚Äù

The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered.

‚ÄúAsk her if she‚Äôs got any jam,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúBe ironical with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you got any jam?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish.‚Äù

The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey! that‚Äôs not the way,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúSay something ironical. Make some crack about Primo de Rivera.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could ask her what kind of a jam they think they‚Äôve gotten into in the Riff.‚Äù

‚ÄúPoor,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúVery poor. You can‚Äôt do it. That‚Äôs all. You don‚Äôt understand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful.‚Äù

‚ÄúRobert Cohn.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot so bad. That‚Äôs better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic.‚Äù

He took a big gulp of coffee.

‚ÄúAw, hell!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You‚Äôre only a newspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical the minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full of pity.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWho did you get this stuff from?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverybody. Don‚Äôt you read? Don‚Äôt you ever see anybody? You know what you are? You‚Äôre an expatriate. Why don‚Äôt you live in New York? Then you‚Äôd know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and tell you every year?‚Äù

‚ÄúTake some more coffee,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúGood. Coffee is good for you. It‚Äôs the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are here. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You know what‚Äôs the trouble with you? You‚Äôre an expatriate. One of the worst type. Haven‚Äôt you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers.‚Äù

He drank the coffee.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an expatriate. You‚Äôve lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around caf√©s.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds like a swell life,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhen do I work?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you‚Äôre impotent.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just had an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever mention that,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the sort of thing that can‚Äôt be spoken of. That‚Äôs what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry‚Äôs bicycle.‚Äù

He had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he had hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him again.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a bicycle,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe was riding horseback.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard it was a tricycle.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúA plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works the same way.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt pedal it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI guess you don‚Äôt pedal it.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs lay off that,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúAll right. I was just standing up for the tricycle.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs a good writer, too,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you were a good guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a good guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen. You‚Äôre a hell of a good guy, and I‚Äôm fonder of you than anybody on earth. I couldn‚Äôt tell you that in New York. It‚Äôd mean I was a faggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a faggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis. Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed by the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel‚Äôs Lady and Judy O‚ÄôGrady are Lesbians under their skin.‚Äù

He stopped.

‚ÄúWant to hear some more?‚Äù

‚ÄúShoot,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any more. Tell you some more at lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúOld Bill,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou bum!‚Äù

We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill put it on. I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my back. We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of the first hill. We walked across the fields on the sandy path. The fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep grazing. The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the woods.

The path crossed a stream on a foot-log. The log was surfaced off, and there was a sapling bent across for a rail. In the flat pool beside the stream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields. Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising.

Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. A sandy road led down to the ford and beyond into the woods. The path crossed the stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we went into the woods.

It was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park.

‚ÄúThis is country,‚Äù Bill said.

The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the time we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete. There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees.

Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.

‚ÄúWe have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley,‚Äù I pointed out to Bill.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hell of a hike.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably.‚Äù

‚ÄúComfortably. That‚Äôs a nice word. We‚Äôll have to go like hell to get there and back and have any fishing at all.‚Äù

It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica.

The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. Ahead was a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. There was a field of buckwheat on the hill. We saw a white house under some trees on the hillside. It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam that crossed the river.

Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure this thing has trout in it?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs full of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some in there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou going to fish bait?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm going to fish the dam here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll take the fly-book, then.‚Äù He tied on a fly. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd I better go? Up or down?‚Äù

‚ÄúDown is the best. They‚Äôre plenty up above, too.‚Äù

Bill went down the bank.

‚ÄúTake a worm can.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want one. If they won‚Äôt take a fly I‚Äôll just flick it around.‚Äù

Bill was down below watching the stream.

‚ÄúSay,‚Äù he called up against the noise of the dam. ‚ÄúHow about putting the wine in that spring up the road?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream. I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my hand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped nobody would find the wine.

I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the baitcan and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam. It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river tumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the falls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the dam.

I did not feel the first trout strike. When I started to pull up I felt that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him up and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into my bag.

While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the same way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same size. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same way, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard from the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. I took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of ferns, then three more trout, and then covered them with ferns. They looked nice in the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the tree.

It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch.

It was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat against the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read. The book was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful story about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a glacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four years exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true love waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up.

‚ÄúGet any?‚Äù he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one hand, and he was sweating. I hadn‚Äôt heard him come up, because of the noise from the dam.

‚ÄúSix. What did you get?‚Äù

Bill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them side by side in the shade from the tree. His face was sweaty and happy.

‚ÄúHow are yours?‚Äù

‚ÄúSmaller.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre packed.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow big are they really?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all about the size of your smallest.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not holding out on me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I were.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet them all on worms?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou lazy bum!‚Äù

Bill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the open bag. He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been wading the stream.

I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and leaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see that bottle,‚Äù he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank. ‚ÄúWhew! That makes my eyes ache.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try it.‚Äù

The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not such filthy wine,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúThe cold helps it,‚Äù I said.

We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch.

‚ÄúChicken.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs hard-boiled eggs.‚Äù

‚ÄúFind any salt?‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst the egg,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúThen the chicken. Even Bryan could see that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead. I read it in the paper yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not really?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Bryan‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

Bill laid down the egg he was peeling.

‚ÄúGentlemen,‚Äù he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper. ‚ÄúI reverse the order. For Bryan‚Äôs sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg.‚Äù

‚ÄúWonder what day God created the chicken?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Bill, sucking the drumstick, ‚Äúhow should we know? We should not question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúEat an egg.‚Äù

Bill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in the other.

‚ÄúLet us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air. Let us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little, brother?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter you, brother.‚Äù

Bill took a long drink.

‚ÄúUtilize a little, brother,‚Äù he handed me the bottle. ‚ÄúLet us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hencoop with simian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say‚ÄîI want you to join with me in saying‚ÄîWhat shall we say, brother?‚Äù He pointed the drumstick at me and went on. ‚ÄúLet me tell you. We will say, and I for one am proud to say‚Äîand I want you to say with me, on your knees, brother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors. Remember the woods were God‚Äôs first temples. Let us kneel and say: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt eat that, Lady‚Äîthat‚Äôs Mencken.‚Äô ‚Äù

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúUtilize a little of this.‚Äù

We uncorked the other bottle.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you like Bryan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI loved Bryan,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúWe were like brothers.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere did you know him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Frankie Fritsch.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI went to Loyola with Bishop Manning.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lie,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cock-eyed,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOn wine?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the humidity,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThey ought to take this damn humidity away.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave another shot.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this all we‚Äôve got?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly the two bottles.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know what you are?‚Äù Bill looked at the bottle affectionately.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League.‚Äù

‚ÄúI went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lie,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúI went to Austin Business College with Wayne B. Wheeler. He was class president.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthe saloon must go.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right there, old classmate,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThe saloon must go, and I will take it with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cock-eyed.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn wine?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn wine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, maybe I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to take a nap?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù

We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees.

‚ÄúYou asleep?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI was thinking.‚Äù

I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground.

‚ÄúSay,‚Äù Bill said, ‚Äúwhat about this Brett business?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you ever in love with her?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù

‚ÄúOff and on for a hell of a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, hell!‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, fella.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn any more.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally. Only I‚Äôd a hell of a lot rather not talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt sore I asked you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the hell should I be?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sleep,‚Äù Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.

‚ÄúListen, Jake,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúare you really a Catholic?‚Äù

‚ÄúTechnically.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, I‚Äôll go to sleep now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep me awake by talking so much.‚Äù

I went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack. It was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and went out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground.

‚ÄúWhat did you do? Wake up?‚Äù Bill asked. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you spend the night?‚Äù I stretched and rubbed my eyes.

‚ÄúI had a lovely dream,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I dreamt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ought to dream,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúAll our biggest business men have been dreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller. Look at Jo Davidson.‚Äù

I disjointed my rod and Bill‚Äôs and packed them in the rodcase. I put the reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one of the trout-bags in. I carried the other.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Bill, ‚Äúhave we got everything?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe worms.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour worms. Put them in there.‚Äù

He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets.

‚ÄúYou got everything now?‚Äù

I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

We started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows lighted, to the inn.

We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing. The nights were cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the heat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank. We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in. In the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris, who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing. He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the Irati River. There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.





CHAPTER XIII


One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was already at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He looked up and smiled.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLetter for you. I stopped at the post and they gave it me with mine.‚Äù

The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup. Harris was reading the paper again. I opened the letter. It had been forwarded from Pamplona. It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:

Dear Jake,

We got here Friday, Brett passed out on the train, so brought her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours. We go to Montoya Hotel Pamplona Tuesday, arriving at I don‚Äôt know what hour. Will you send a note by the bus to tell us what to do to rejoin you all on Wednesday. All our love and sorry to be late, but Brett was really done in and will be quite all right by Tues. and is practically so now. I know her so well and try to look after her but it‚Äôs not so easy. Love to all the chaps,

Michael.

‚ÄúWhat day of the week is it?‚Äù I asked Harris.

‚ÄúWednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses track of the days up here in the mountains.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. We‚Äôve been here nearly a week.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not thinking of leaving?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. We‚Äôll go in on the afternoon bus, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a rotten business. I had hoped we‚Äôd all have another go at the Irati together.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have to go into Pamplona. We‚Äôre meeting people there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat rotten luck for me. We‚Äôve had a jolly time here at Burguete.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there‚Äôs going to be a damned fine fiesta.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I‚Äôd best stop on here, though. I‚Äôve not much more time to fish.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want those big ones in the Irati.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, I do, you know. They‚Äôre enormous trout there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to try them once more.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo. Stop over another day. Be a good chap.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe really have to get into town,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhat a pity.‚Äù

After breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench out in front of the inn and talking it over. I saw a girl coming up the road from the centre of the town. She stopped in front of us and took a telegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt.

‚ÄúPor ustedes?‚Äù

I looked at it. The address was: ‚ÄúBarnes, Burguete.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôs for us.‚Äù

She brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of coppers. The telegram was in Spanish: ‚ÄúVengo Jueves Cohn.‚Äù

I handed it to Bill.

‚ÄúWhat does the word Cohn mean?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúWhat a lousy telegram!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe could send ten words for the same price. ‚ÄòI come Thursday‚Äô. That gives you a lot of dope, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt gives you all the dope that‚Äôs of interest to Cohn.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going in, anyway,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no use trying to move Brett and Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe might as well,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for us to be snooty.‚Äù

We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank.

‚ÄúWhat will we say?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚Äú ‚ÄòArriving to-night.‚Äô That‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

We paid for the message and walked back to the inn. Harris was there and the three of us walked up to Roncesvalles. We went through the monastery.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs remarkable place,‚Äù Harris said, when we came out. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm not much on those sort of places.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe either,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a remarkable place, though,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt not have seen it. I‚Äôd been intending coming up each day.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt the same as fishing, though, is it?‚Äù Bill asked. He liked Harris.

‚ÄúI say not.‚Äù

We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a pub across the way?‚Äù Harris asked. ‚ÄúOr do my eyes deceive me?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has the look of a pub,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúIt looks to me like a pub,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI say,‚Äù said Harris, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs utilize it.‚Äù He had taken up utilizing from Bill.

We had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay.

He talked Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money.

‚ÄúI say. You don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs meant to me to have you chaps up here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a grand time, Harris.‚Äù

Harris was a little tight.

‚ÄúI say. Really you don‚Äôt know how much it means. I‚Äôve not had much fun since the war.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll fish together again, some time. Don‚Äôt you forget it, Harris.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must. We have had such a jolly good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about another bottle around?‚Äù

‚ÄúJolly good idea,‚Äù said Harris.

‚ÄúThis is mine,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúOr we don‚Äôt drink it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd let me pay for it. It does give me pleasure, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is going to give me pleasure,‚Äù Bill said.

The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same glasses. Harris lifted his glass.

‚ÄúI say. You know this does utilize well.‚Äù

Bill slapped him on the back.

‚ÄúGood old Harris.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say. You know my name isn‚Äôt really Harris. It‚Äôs Wilson Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood old Wilson-Harris,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúWe call you Harris because we‚Äôre so fond of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, Barnes. You don‚Äôt know what this all means to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on and utilize another glass,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúBarnes. Really, Barnes, you can‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrink up, Harris.‚Äù

We walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us. We had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus. He gave us his card, with his address in London and his club and his business address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope. I opened mine and there were a dozen flies in it. Harris had tied them himself. He tied all his own flies.

‚ÄúI say, Harris‚Äî‚Äù I began.

‚ÄúNo, no!‚Äù he said. He was climbing down from the bus. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had.‚Äù

The bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved. As we started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn.

‚ÄúSay, wasn‚Äôt that Harris nice?‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúI think he really did have a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarris? You bet he did.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish he‚Äôd come into Pamplona.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wanted to fish.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. You couldn‚Äôt tell how English would mix with each other, anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose not.‚Äù

We got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya. Out in the plaza they were stringing electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. A few kids came up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with us, smiling in his embarrassed way.

‚ÄúYour friends are here,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúMr. Campbell?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley.‚Äù

He smiled as though there were something I would hear about.

‚ÄúWhen did they get in?‚Äù

‚ÄúYesterday. I‚Äôve saved you the rooms you had.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. All the rooms we looked at.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are our friends now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think they went to the pelota.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how about the bulls?‚Äù

Montoya smiled. ‚ÄúTo-night,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo-night at seven o‚Äôclock they bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go down?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes. They‚Äôve never seen a desencajonada.‚Äù

Montoya put his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you there.‚Äù

He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not understand.

‚ÄúYour friend, is he aficionado, too?‚Äù Montoya smiled at Bill.

‚ÄúYes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Montoya politely disbelieved. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs not aficionado like you.‚Äù

He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a real aficionado.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs not aficionado like you are.‚Äù

Aficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya‚Äôs hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed once, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year. In Montoya‚Äôs room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated to Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters Montoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean anything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket. He did not want them around.

We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the Montoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not have aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a ‚ÄúBuen hombre.‚Äù But nearly always there was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch you to make it certain.

Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bullfighting.

Bill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and changing in his room.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútalk a lot of Spanish?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was telling me about the bulls coming in tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find the gang and go down.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right. They‚Äôll probably be at the caf√©.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you got tickets?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I got them for all the unloadings.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like?‚Äù He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty good,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey let the bulls out of the cages one at a time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them from fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run around like old maids trying to quiet them down.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they ever gore the steers?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt the steers do anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. They‚Äôre trying to make friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do they have them in for?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking their horns against the stone walls, or goring each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be swell being a steer.‚Äù

We went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square toward the caf√© Iru√±a. There were two lonely looking ticket-houses standing in the square. Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and SOMBRA, were shut. They would not open until the day before the fiesta.

Across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iru√±a extended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street. I looked for Brett and Mike at the tables. There they were. Brett and Mike and Robert Cohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret. So was Mike. Robert Cohn was bare-headed and wearing his spectacles. Brett saw us coming and waved. Her eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table.

‚ÄúHello, you chaps!‚Äù she called.

Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.

‚ÄúWhere the hell have you been?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI brought them up here,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúWhat rot,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd have gotten here earlier if you hadn‚Äôt come.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd never have gotten here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you get good fishing?‚Äù Mike asked. ‚ÄúWe wanted to join you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt bad. We missed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to come,‚Äù Cohn said, ‚Äúbut I thought I ought to bring them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bring us. What rot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas it really good?‚Äù Mike asked. ‚ÄúDid you take many?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúNamed Harris,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúEver know him, Mike? He was in the war, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúFortunate fellow,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúWhat times we had. How I wish those dear days were back.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you in the war, Mike?‚Äù Cohn asked.

‚ÄúWas I not.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was a very distinguished soldier,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúTell them about the time your horse bolted down Piccadilly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll not. I‚Äôve told that four times.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never told me,‚Äù Robert Cohn said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell them about your medals.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll not. That story reflects great discredit on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat story‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on. Tell it, Brett.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould I?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell it myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat medals have you got, Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt got any medals.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou must have some.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose I‚Äôve the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time there was this whopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be there, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no medals, and I stopped at my tailor‚Äôs and he was impressed by the invitation, and I thought that‚Äôs a good piece of business, and I said to him: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got to fix me up with some medals.‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòWhat medals, sir?‚Äô And I said: ‚ÄòOh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.‚Äô So he said: ‚ÄòWhat medals have you, sir?‚Äô And I said: ‚ÄòHow should I know?‚Äô Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? ‚ÄòJust give me a good lot. Pick them out yourself.‚Äô So he got me some medals, you know, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket and forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they‚Äôd shot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn‚Äôt come and the King didn‚Äôt come, and no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off their medals, and I had mine in my pocket.‚Äù

He stopped for us to laugh.

‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all. Perhaps I didn‚Äôt tell it right.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúBut no matter.‚Äù

We were all laughing.

‚ÄúAh, yes,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúI know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I couldn‚Äôt stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket. What‚Äôs this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut them all off their backing‚Äîyou know, they put them on a strip‚Äîand gave them all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I was hell‚Äôs own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club. Dashing fellow.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell the rest,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that was funny?‚Äù Mike asked. We were all laughing. ‚ÄúIt was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell‚Äôs own store by them.‚Äù Mike paused. ‚ÄúRotten luck for the tailor,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean it,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI should think it would have been grand for the tailor.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he wouldn‚Äôt send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt. It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you go bankrupt?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúTwo ways,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúGradually and then suddenly.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat brought it on?‚Äù

‚ÄúFriends,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúI had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell them about in the court,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI was just a little tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúTight!‚Äù Brett exclaimed. ‚ÄúYou were blind!‚Äù

‚ÄúExtraordinary thing,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúMet my former partner the other day. Offered to buy me a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell them about your learned counsel,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI will not,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúMy learned counsel was blind, too. I say this is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go down.‚Äù

We called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town. I started off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her on the other side. The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were many people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips rising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we turned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where we‚Äôll go when funds get low,‚Äù Brett said.

The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared. They were staring at Brett.

At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that went in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low, stone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with apertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the face of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls that separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with the bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out of their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name and the brand of the bull-breeder.

We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the corral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.

‚ÄúLook up there,‚Äù I said.

Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls and ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications made three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in the windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had climbed into the trees.

‚ÄúThey must think something is going to happen,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúThey want to see the bulls.‚Äù

Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They waved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing against us when other people crowded them.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they start?‚Äù Robert Cohn asked.

A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against the gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars into position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull would enter.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt look happy,‚Äù Brett said.

The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the corral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage.

I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark. Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to explode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his horns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in the straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the crowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall, their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.

The bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he reached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick, searching drives with the right horn.

‚ÄúMy God, isn‚Äôt he beautiful?‚Äù Brett said. We were looking right down on him.

‚ÄúLook how he knows how to use his horns,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a left and a right just like a boxer.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou watch.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt goes too fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. There‚Äôll be another one in a minute.‚Äù

They had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull came out into the corral.

He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the planks and shouted, to turn him. He did not change his direction and the men shouted: ‚ÄúHah! Hah! Toro!‚Äù and waved their arms; the two steers turned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the steers.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look,‚Äù I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt buck you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI saw him shift from his left to his right horn.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn good!‚Äù

The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay the way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging, watching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The next time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to the other bull.

When the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer, stood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the newcomer. In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him down, and made him one of the herd. When the last two bulls had been unloaded the herd were all together.

The steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against the stone wall. None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt to join the herd.

We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. They were all quiet now, their heads down. We got a carriage outside and rode up to the caf√©. Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on the way for several drinks.

We were sitting in the caf√©.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an extraordinary business,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúWill those last ones fight as well as the first?‚Äù Robert Cohn asked. ‚ÄúThey seemed to quiet down awfully fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey all know each other,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre only dangerous when they‚Äôre alone, or only two or three of them together.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, dangerous?‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThey all looked dangerous to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey only want to kill when they‚Äôre alone. Of course, if you went in there you‚Äôd probably detach one of them from the herd, and he‚Äôd be dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too complicated,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever detach me from the herd, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say,‚Äù Mike said, ‚Äúthey were fine bulls, weren‚Äôt they? Did you see their horns?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid I not,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúI had no idea what they were like.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you see the one hit that steer?‚Äù Mike asked. ‚ÄúThat was extraordinary.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no life being a steer,‚Äù Robert Cohn said.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think so?‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI would have thought you‚Äôd loved being a steer, Robert.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they‚Äôre always hanging about so.‚Äù

We were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on talking.

‚ÄúI should think you‚Äôd love it. You‚Äôd never have to say a word. Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don‚Äôt just sit there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said something, Mike. Don‚Äôt you remember? About the steers.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, say something more. Say something funny. Can‚Äôt you see we‚Äôre all having a good time here?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome off it, Michael. You‚Äôre drunk,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not drunk. I‚Äôm quite serious. Is Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding.‚Äù

‚ÄúBreeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? Aren‚Äôt the bulls lovely? Don‚Äôt you like them, Bill? Why don‚Äôt you say something, Robert? Don‚Äôt sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She‚Äôs slept with lots of better people than you.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Cohn said. He stood up. ‚ÄúShut up, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That won‚Äôt make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don‚Äôt you know you‚Äôre not wanted? I know when I‚Äôm not wanted. Why don‚Äôt you know when you‚Äôre not wanted? You came down to San Sebastian where you weren‚Äôt wanted, and followed Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that‚Äôs right?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up. You‚Äôre drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps I am drunk. Why aren‚Äôt you drunk? Why don‚Äôt you ever get drunk, Robert? You know you didn‚Äôt have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can‚Äôt blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn‚Äôt do it. You can‚Äôt blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to hell, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around? Haven‚Äôt you any manners? How do you think it makes me feel?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a splendid one to talk about manners,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve such lovely manners.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Robert,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúWhat do you follow her around for?‚Äù

Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúRobert Cohn‚Äôs going to buy a drink.‚Äù

Bill went off with Cohn. Cohn‚Äôs face was sallow. Mike went on talking. I sat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted.

‚ÄúI say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass,‚Äù she interrupted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs not right, you know.‚Äù She turned to me.

The emotion left Mike‚Äôs voice. We were all friends together.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so damn drunk as I sounded,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre not,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre none of us sober,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything I didn‚Äôt mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you put it so badly,‚Äù Brett laughed.

‚ÄúHe was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well wasn‚Äôt wanted. He hung around Brett and just looked at her. It made me damned well sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did behave very badly,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúMark you. Brett‚Äôs had affairs with men before. She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn‚Äôs letters to read. I wouldn‚Äôt read them.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamned noble of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, listen, Jake. Brett‚Äôs gone off with men. But they weren‚Äôt ever Jews, and they didn‚Äôt come and hang about afterward.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamned good chaps,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all rot to talk about it. Michael and I understand each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe gave me Robert Cohn‚Äôs letters. I wouldn‚Äôt read them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt read any letters, darling. You wouldn‚Äôt read mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt read letters,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúFunny, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt read anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I‚Äôm at home.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be writing next,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúCome on, Michael. Do buck up. You‚Äôve got to go through with this thing now. He‚Äôs here. Don‚Äôt spoil the fiesta.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, let him behave, then.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll behave. I‚Äôll tell him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit would be nice for me to tell him.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no. I can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on. We‚Äôre all friends. Aren‚Äôt we all friends, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell him. It‚Äôs too ridiculous.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt, Michael. Don‚Äôt be an ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe calls her Circe,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúHe claims she turns men into swine. Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôd be good, you know,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHe writes a good letter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe wrote me from San Sebastian.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was nothing,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHe can write a damned amusing letter.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.‚Äù

‚ÄúI damned well was, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwe must go in and eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow should I meet Cohn?‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúJust act as though nothing had happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite all right with me,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not embarrassed.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he says anything, just say you were tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúAre these poisonous things paid for? I must bathe before dinner.‚Äù

We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the caf√©s under the arcades. We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel.

They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya.

‚ÄúWell, how did you like the bulls?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúGood. They were nice bulls.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all right‚Äù‚ÄîMontoya shook his head‚Äî‚Äúbut they‚Äôre not too good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat didn‚Äôt you like about them?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. They just didn‚Äôt give me the feeling that they were so good.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what you mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. They‚Äôre all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did your friends like them?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Montoya said.

I went up-stairs. Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking out at the square. I stood beside him.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Cohn?‚Äù

‚ÄúUp-stairs in his room.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow does he feel?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He‚Äôs terrible when he‚Äôs tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt so tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hell he wasn‚Äôt. I know what we had before we came to the caf√©.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe sobered up afterward.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. He was terrible. I don‚Äôt like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was a silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any business to talk like Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you like the bulls?‚Äù

‚ÄúGrand. It‚Äôs grand the way they bring them out.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo-morrow come the Miuras.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen does the fiesta start?‚Äù

‚ÄúDay after to-morrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd better get cleaned up for supper.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. That will be a pleasant meal.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt it?‚Äù

As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black, sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as though nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down. He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but he cheered up finally. He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to make him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it. They could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was Michael. They were good together.

It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.





CHAPTER XIV


I do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk, and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and started to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the same two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in ‚ÄúA Sportsman‚Äôs Sketches.‚Äù I had read it before, but it seemed quite new. The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes because the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that feeling would pass.

I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night outside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the room next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not necessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light. The hell there isn‚Äôt!

I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women, anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.

Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.

I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money‚Äôs worth and knowing when you had it. You could get your money‚Äôs worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I‚Äôve had.

Perhaps that wasn‚Äôt true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.

I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never drunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What rot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The English spoken language‚Äîthe upper classes, anyway‚Äîmust have fewer words than the Eskimo. Of course I didn‚Äôt know anything about the Eskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn‚Äôt know anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with inflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though. I liked the way they talked. Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper classes.

I turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was another good thing you paid for and then had. Some time along toward daylight I went to sleep.

The next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows. The town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their way to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each timber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bullring. The big gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being swept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced weakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old women sweeping out the boxes.

Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning of the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees. The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth advertised ANIS DEL TORO. The cloth sign hung against the planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town there was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the terrasse of the caf√© and watched the motor-buses come in and unload peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags full of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and the man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the streets.

In the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all the good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the caf√© tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.

During the morning I usually sat in the caf√© and read the Madrid papers and then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went along. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the caf√©. It was a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times, once with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know. We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.

It was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains. It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the plateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt healthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn. You could not be upset about anything on a day like that.

That was the last day before the fiesta.





CHAPTER XV


At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no other way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice them. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The peasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking, getting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually. They could not start in paying caf√© prices. They got their money‚Äôs worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.

Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been in the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning. Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops. They were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o‚Äôclock mass. San Fermin is also a religious festival.

I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the caf√© on the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were sitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs. The caf√© was like a battleship stripped for action. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read without asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as soon as I sat down.

‚ÄúWhat are you drinking?‚Äù I asked Bill and Robert.

‚ÄúSherry,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúJerez,‚Äù I said to the waiter.

Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the plaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright sunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of smoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get through the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the drums coming. They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing. When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when the reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums tapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing. In the crowd you saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.

In the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd of children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes. He came out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past the caf√© and down a side street. We saw his blank pockmarked face as he went by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at him.

‚ÄúHe must be the village idiot,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúMy God! look at that!‚Äù

Down the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all men. They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers. They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen‚Äôs blue smocks, and red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles. The banner danced up and down with them as they came down surrounded by the crowd.

‚ÄúHurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!‚Äù was painted on the banner.

‚ÄúWhere are the foreigners?‚Äù Robert Cohn asked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the foreigners,‚Äù Bill said.

All the time rockets were going up. The caf√© tables were all full now. The square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the caf√©s.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Brett and Mike?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go and get them,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúBring them here.‚Äù

The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days. The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven days.

That afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was translated from one church to another. In the procession were all the dignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the crowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced the riau-riau dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up and down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the riau-riau.

They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the chapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping their place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers formed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths of white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms and put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all chanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the sharp riau-riau! they rushed us into a wine-shop.

We stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back of the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.

‚ÄúI want a leather wine-bottle,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a place down the street,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go get a couple.‚Äù

The dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the wine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one insisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song. Singing it into his ear. Beating time on Bill‚Äôs back.

I explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered, and I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both sides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and led me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.

Inside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was stencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He took one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on it.

‚ÄúSee! It doesn‚Äôt leak.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want another one, too. A big one.‚Äù

He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof. He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on the bota holding on to a chair.

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Drink out of them.‚Äù

He slapped me on the back.

‚ÄúGood man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price.‚Äù

The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile stopped.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEight pesetas is cheap.‚Äù

I paid and went out and along the street back to the wineshop. It was darker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill, and some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl filled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the wine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay then bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the big five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the back of his throat.

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù he said, and handed back the bag.

In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by the dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else‚Äôs shoulders, and they were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and vinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar with pieces of bread.

‚ÄúHello, Jake. Hello!‚Äù Mike called. ‚ÄúCome here. I want you to meet my friends. We‚Äôre all having an hors d‚Äô≈ìuvre.‚Äù

I was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names to Mike and sent for a fork for me.

‚ÄúStop eating their dinner, Michael,‚Äù Brett shouted from the wine-barrels.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to eat up your meal,‚Äù I said when some one handed me a fork.

‚ÄúEat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat do you think it‚Äôs here for?‚Äù

I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around. Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm‚Äôs length.

Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession going by.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that the procession?‚Äù Mike asked.

‚ÄúNada,‚Äù some one said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere did they find you?‚Äù I asked Mike.

‚ÄúSome one brought me here,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúThey said you were here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Cohn?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs passed out,‚Äù Brett called. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve put him away somewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow should we know,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not dead,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs not dead. He‚Äôs just passed out on Anis del Mono.‚Äù

As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo, thanks!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!‚Äù

I took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could feel it warming in my stomach.

‚ÄúWhere the hell is Cohn?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?‚Äù he asked in Spanish.

‚ÄúYou want to see him?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNot me,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúThis gent.‚Äù

The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up.

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It was almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics.

‚ÄúLet him sleep,‚Äù the man whispered. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all right.‚Äù

Two hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with the wreath of garlics around his neck. The Spaniards shouted when he came in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.

‚ÄúI must have been sleeping,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOh, not at all,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúYou were only dead,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we going to go and have some supper?‚Äù Cohn asked.

‚ÄúDo you want to eat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Why not? I‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù

‚ÄúEat those garlics, Robert,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI say. Do eat those garlics.‚Äù

Cohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right.

‚ÄúDo let‚Äôs go and eat,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI must get a bath.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs translate Brett to the hotel.‚Äù

We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out. Outside it was dark.

‚ÄúWhat time is it do you suppose?‚Äù Cohn asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs to-morrow,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been asleep two days.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Cohn, ‚Äúwhat time is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ten o‚Äôclock.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a lot we‚Äôve drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean what a lot we‚Äôve drunk. You went to sleep.‚Äù

Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the skyrockets going up in the square. Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.

It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After the dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six o‚Äôclock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around four o‚Äôclock. The others stayed up.

My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs and slept on one of the beds in Cohn‚Äôs room. The fiesta was going on outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn‚Äôs and went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together.

After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bullring. It kept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back in the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony in bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring. Back in bed, I went to sleep.

Cohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just across the street were looking in.

‚ÄúDid you see the show?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes. We were all there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnybody get hurt?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight people.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did Brett like it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was all so sudden there wasn‚Äôt any time for it to bother anybody.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd been up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere did you stay up?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe danced at some club.‚Äù

‚ÄúI got sleepy,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúMy gosh! I‚Äôm sleepy now,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt this thing ever stop?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot for a week.‚Äù

Bill opened the door and put his head in.

‚ÄúWhere were you, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?‚Äù

‚ÄúGrand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo sleep.‚Äù

No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade. The town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we went over to the Iru√±a. It had filled up, and as the time for the bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The caf√© did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how crowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.

I had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras, the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to a waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how to look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of bullfights.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried about how I‚Äôll stand it. I‚Äôm only afraid I may be bored,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at the horses, after the bull hits them,‚Äù I said to Brett. ‚ÄúWatch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don‚Äôt look again until the horse is dead if it‚Äôs been hit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little nervy about it,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried whether I‚Äôll be able to go through with it all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be all right. There‚Äôs nothing but that horse part that will bother you, and they‚Äôre only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just don‚Äôt watch when it‚Äôs bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be all right,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look after her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be bored,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wineskin,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSee you back here. Don‚Äôt get cock-eyed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll come along,‚Äù Bill said. Brett smiled at us.

We walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square.

‚ÄúThat Cohn gets me,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he‚Äôll get out of the fight will be being bored.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll watch him with the glasses,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh, to hell with him!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe spends a lot of time there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want him to stay there.‚Äù

In the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù said Montoya. ‚ÄúDo you want to meet Pedro Romero?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go see him.‚Äù

We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in room number eight,‚Äù Montoya explained. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting dressed for the bull-fight.‚Äù

Montoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were two beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on. The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes. His jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing winding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore a white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up and stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and dignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen.

‚ÄúYou go to the bull-fight,‚Äù he said in English.

‚ÄúYou know English,‚Äù I said, feeling like an idiot.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he answered, and smiled.

One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us if we spoke French. ‚ÄúWould you like me to interpret for you? Is there anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?‚Äù

We thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We wished him ‚ÄúMucha suerte,‚Äù shook hands, and went out. He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a fine boy, don‚Äôt you think so?‚Äù Montoya asked.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good-looking kid,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHe looks like a torero,‚Äù Montoya said. ‚ÄúHe has the type.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a fine boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see how he is in the ring,‚Äù Montoya said.

We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs.

It was a good bull-fight. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro Romero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much.

Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and Cohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look upset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front of them.

‚ÄúLet me take the glasses,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúDoes Cohn look bored?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThat kike!‚Äù

Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in the crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and the feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta was going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The dancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the feet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and down. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the caf√©. The waiter saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched the crowd in the square and the dancers.

‚ÄúWhat do you suppose that dance is?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sort of jota.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not all the same,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThey dance differently to all the different tunes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs swell dancing.‚Äù

In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and concentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels touched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.

‚ÄúHere come the gentry,‚Äù Bill said.

They were crossing the street.

‚ÄúHello, men,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHello, gents!‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúYou saved us seats? How nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say,‚Äù Mike said, ‚Äúthat Romero what‚Äôshisname is somebody. Am I wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, isn‚Äôt he lovely,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúAnd those green trousers.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrett never took her eyes off them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did it go?‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about the horses?‚Äù

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help looking at them.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe couldn‚Äôt take her eyes off them,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an extraordinary wench.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey do have some rather awful things happen to them,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt look away, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you feel all right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel badly at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúRobert Cohn did,‚Äù Mike put in. ‚ÄúYou were quite green, Robert.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe first horse did bother me,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt bored, were you?‚Äù asked Bill.

Cohn laughed.

‚ÄúNo. I wasn‚Äôt bored. I wish you‚Äôd forgive me that.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right,‚Äù Bill said, ‚Äúso long as you weren‚Äôt bored.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt look bored,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI thought he was going to be sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never felt that bad. It was just for a minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought he was going to be sick. You weren‚Äôt bored, were you, Robert?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was, you know. He was positively green.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, shove it along, Michael.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúIt might make such a mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, shove it along, Michael,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúHe said Brett was a sadist,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúBrett‚Äôs not a sadist. She‚Äôs just a lovely, healthy wench.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you a sadist, Brett?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHope not.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy stomach.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt be healthy long.‚Äù

Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought the absinthe glasses.

‚ÄúDid you really like it?‚Äù Bill asked Cohn.

‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt say I liked it. I think it‚Äôs a wonderful show.‚Äù

‚ÄúGad, yes! What a spectacle!‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI wish they didn‚Äôt have the horse part,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not important,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúAfter a while you never notice anything disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a bit strong just at the start,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe bulls were fine,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúThey were very good,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúI want to sit down below, next time.‚Äù Brett drank from her glass of absinthe.

‚ÄúShe wants to see the bull-fighters close by,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúThey are something,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúThat Romero lad is just a child.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a damned good-looking boy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhen we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow old do you suppose he is?‚Äù

‚ÄúNineteen or twenty.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust imagine it.‚Äù

The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first. Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they did not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but smoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked Romero‚Äôs cape-work and why she did not like the others.

Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line. The others twisted themselves like cork-screws, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero‚Äôs bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen him do an awkward thing,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt until he gets frightened,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll never be frightened,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúHe knows too damned much.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe knew everything when he started. The others can‚Äôt ever learn what he was born with.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd God, what looks,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI believe, you know, that she‚Äôs falling in love with this bullfighter chap,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.‚Äù

‚ÄúBe a good chap, Jake. Don‚Äôt tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me what drunks they are.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, frightful,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúDrunk all day and spend all their time beating their poor old mothers.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe looks that way,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt he?‚Äù I said.

They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked, the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.

‚ÄúThis next is the last one.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.

After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.

‚ÄúThese bull-fights are hell on one,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm limp as a rag.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôll get a drink,‚Äù Mike said.

The next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all day and all night the fiesta kept on.





CHAPTER XVI


In the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from the sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.

The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the arcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause. It was only driven under cover.

The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp, and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed horses, their costumes wet, the horses‚Äô coats wet in the rain. The crowd was in the caf√©s and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs to dry. It was raining hard outside.

I left the crowd in the caf√© and went over to the hotel to get shaved for dinner. I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I called.

Montoya walked in.

‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo bulls to-day.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúnothing but rain.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are your friends?‚Äù

‚ÄúOver at the Iru√±a.‚Äù

Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDo you know the American ambassador?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEverybody knows the American ambassador.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs here in town, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs seen them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen them, too,‚Äù Montoya said. He didn‚Äôt say anything. I went on shaving.

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet me send for a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I have to go.‚Äù

I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit can‚Äôt hurt Marcial any.‚Äù

‚ÄúMarcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this morning with Marquez. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be back to-night.‚Äù

Montoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give Romero the message,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù

Montoya was very pleased.

‚ÄúI wanted to ask you because you were an American,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Montoya. ‚ÄúPeople take a boy like that. They don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs worth. They don‚Äôt know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they‚Äôre through.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike Algabeno,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYes, like Algabeno.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a fine lot,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. They only want the young ones.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe old ones get fat.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr crazy like Gallo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs easy. All you have to do is not give him the message.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such a fine boy,‚Äù said Montoya. ‚ÄúHe ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn‚Äôt mix in that stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you have a drink?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Montoya, ‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù He went out.

I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square. It was still raining. I looked in at the Iru√±a for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the square and back to the hotel. They were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room.

They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.

‚ÄúThis is the eleventh time my boots have been polished,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI say, Bill is an ass.‚Äù

The bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in.

‚ÄúLimpia botas?‚Äù he said to Bill.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúFor this Se√±or.‚Äù

The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike‚Äôs free shoe that shone already in the electric light.

‚ÄúBill‚Äôs a yell of laughter,‚Äù Mike said.

I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. I looked around the room. At the next table was Pedro Romero. He stood up when I nodded, and asked me to come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost touching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man with a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I reached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm. Romero laughed.

‚ÄúDrink here,‚Äù he said in English.

He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them. He was anxious to know the English for Corrida de toros, the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious of. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the lidia of a toro. The Spanish word corrida means in English the running of bulls‚Äîthe French translation is Course de taureaux. The critic put that in. There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.

Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was born in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it three years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of Malague√±o expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I told him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake.

‚ÄúWhere did you see me the other time? In Madrid?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.

‚ÄúThe first or the second time?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe first.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was very bad,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe second time I was better. You remember?‚Äù He turned to the critic.

He was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something altogether apart from himself. There was nothing conceited or braggartly about him.

‚ÄúI like it very much that you like my work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you haven‚Äôt seen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to you.‚Äù

When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bullfight critic nor I would think he was boasting.

‚ÄúI am anxious to see it,‚Äù the critic said. ‚ÄúI would like to be convinced.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like my work much.‚Äù Romero turned to me. He was serious.

The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete.

‚ÄúWait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen the bulls for to-morrow?‚Äù the critic asked me.

‚ÄúYes. I saw them unloaded.‚Äù

Pedro Romero leaned forward.

‚ÄúWhat did you think of them?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery nice,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAbout twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns. Haven‚Äôt you seen them?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù said Romero.

‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt weigh twenty-six arrobas,‚Äù said the critic.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Romero.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got bananas for horns,‚Äù the critic said.

‚ÄúYou call them bananas?‚Äù asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt call them bananas?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre horns all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre very short,‚Äù said Pedro Romero. ‚ÄúVery, very short. Still, they aren‚Äôt bananas.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, Jake,‚Äù Brett called from the next table, ‚Äúyou have deserted us.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust temporarily,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking bulls.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are superior.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell him that bulls have no balls,‚Äù Mike shouted. He was drunk.

Romero looked at me inquiringly.

‚ÄúDrunk,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBorracho! Muy borracho!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou might introduce your friends,‚Äù Brett said. She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee with us. They both stood up. Romero‚Äôs face was very brown. He had very nice manners.

I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee. Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody. There was a lot of drunken talking.

‚ÄúTell him I think writing is lousy,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúGo on, tell him. Tell him I‚Äôm ashamed of being a writer.‚Äù

Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her.

‚ÄúGo on. Tell him!‚Äù Bill said.

Romero looked up smiling.

‚ÄúThis gentleman,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúis a writer.‚Äù

Romero was impressed. ‚ÄúThis other one, too,‚Äù I said, pointing at Cohn.

‚ÄúHe looks like Villalta,‚Äù Romero said, looking at Bill. ‚ÄúRafael, doesn‚Äôt he look like Villalta?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see it,‚Äù the critic said.

‚ÄúReally,‚Äù Romero said in Spanish. ‚ÄúHe looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that why he drinks?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs waiting to marry this lady.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell him bulls have no balls!‚Äù Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table.

‚ÄúWhat does he say?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúJake,‚Äù Mike called. ‚ÄúTell him bulls have no balls!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou understand?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

I was sure he didn‚Äôt, so it was all right.

‚ÄúTell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants.‚Äù

‚ÄúPipe down, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants.‚Äù

‚ÄúPipe down.‚Äù

During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing.

Bill was filling the glasses.

‚ÄúTell him Brett wants to come into‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ‚Äôs sake!‚Äù

Romero looked up smiling. ‚ÄúPipe down! I know that,‚Äù he said.

Just then Montoya came into the room. He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod.

Montoya went out of the room. Mike was on his feet proposing a toast. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all drink to‚Äî‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúPedro Romero,‚Äù I said. Everybody stood up. Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to. But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together.

‚ÄúMy God! he‚Äôs a lovely boy,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúAnd how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.‚Äù

‚ÄúI started to tell him,‚Äù Mike began. ‚ÄúAnd Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôd like to get this settled.‚Äù He turned away from me. ‚ÄúDo you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God‚Äôs sake don‚Äôt be so noisy, Cohn!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, cut it out, Mike,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúDo you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party? Why don‚Äôt you say something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said all I had to say the other night, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not one of you literary chaps.‚Äù Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not clever. But I do know when I‚Äôm not wanted. Why don‚Äôt you see when you‚Äôre not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for God‚Äôs sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don‚Äôt you think I‚Äôm right?‚Äù

He looked at us.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all go over to the Iru√±a.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Don‚Äôt you think I‚Äôm right? I love that woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt start that again. Do shove it along, Michael,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I‚Äôm right, Jake?‚Äù

Cohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.

‚ÄúJake,‚Äù Mike said. He was almost crying. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm right. Listen, you!‚Äù He turned to Cohn: ‚ÄúGo away! Go away now!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I won‚Äôt go, Mike,‚Äù said Cohn.

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll make you!‚Äù Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.

I grabbed Mike. ‚ÄúCome on to the caf√©,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hit him here in the hotel.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood!‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúGood idea!‚Äù

We started off. I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again. Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador. Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing.

Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the crowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.

Brett came out with Bill and joined us. We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito‚Äôs face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people. The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened, caught fire, and fell.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre razzing Don Manuel,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúHow do you know he‚Äôs Don Manuel?‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúHis name‚Äôs on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad.‚Äù

‚ÄúGlobos illuminados,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúA collection of globos illuminados. That‚Äôs what the paper said.‚Äù

The wind blew the band music away.

‚ÄúI say, I wish one would go up,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúThat Don Manuel chap is furious.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out ‚ÄòHail to San Fermin,‚Äô ‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúGlobos illuminados,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúA bunch of bloody globos illuminados.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stand here.‚Äù

‚ÄúHer ladyship wants a drink,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúHow you know things,‚Äù Brett said.

Inside, the caf√© was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in. We could not find a table. There was a great noise going on.

‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs get out of here,‚Äù Bill said.

Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade. There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables. Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill‚Äôs from Biarritz. She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the pub,‚Äù Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not full. There was nothing going on.

‚ÄúThis is a hell of a place,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take the bottle and come back later,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sit here on a night like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go and look at the English,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI love to look at the English.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre awful,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúWhere did they all come from?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey come from Biarritz,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúThey come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll festa them,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an extraordinarily beautiful girl.‚Äù Mike turned to Bill‚Äôs friend. ‚ÄúWhen did you come here?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome off it, Michael.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You‚Äôre a lovely thing. Have we met? Come along with me and Bill. We‚Äôre going to festa the English.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll festa them,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are they doing at this fiesta?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúJust us three. We‚Äôre going to festa the bloody English. I hope you‚Äôre not English? I‚Äôm Scotch. I hate the English. I‚Äôm going to festa them. Come on, Bill.‚Äù

Through the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the caf√©. Rockets were going up in the square.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sit here,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay with you,‚Äù Cohn said.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt!‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake, go off somewhere. Can‚Äôt you see Jake and I want to talk?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd sit here because I felt a little tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you‚Äôre tight, go to bed. Go on to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas I rude enough to him?‚Äù Brett asked. Cohn was gone. ‚ÄúMy God! I‚Äôm so sick of him!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt add much to the gayety.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe depresses me so.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs behaved very badly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamned badly. He had a chance to behave so well.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably waiting just outside the door now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can‚Äôt believe it didn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I‚Äôm so sick of the whole thing. And Michael. Michael‚Äôs been lovely, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been damned hard on Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. But he didn‚Äôt need to be a swine.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverybody behaves badly,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGive them the proper chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt behave badly.‚Äù Brett looked at me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be as big an ass as Cohn,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDarling, don‚Äôt let‚Äôs talk a lot of rot.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right. Talk about anything you like.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be difficult. You‚Äôre the only person I‚Äôve got, and I feel rather awful to-night.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mike. Hasn‚Äôt he been pretty?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and seeing him with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I know it, darling? Please don‚Äôt make me feel any worse than I do.‚Äù

Brett was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away from me and looking ahead at the wall.

‚ÄúWant to go for a walk?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Come on.‚Äù

I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have one more drink of that,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúMy nerves are rotten.‚Äù

We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù said Brett.

As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.

‚ÄúHe was there,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt be away from you.‚Äù

‚ÄúPoor devil!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sorry for him. I hate him, myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hate him, too,‚Äù she shivered. ‚ÄúI hate his damned suffering.‚Äù

We walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the lights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along it to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden bursts of music.

‚ÄúWant to go in?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down. Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind was high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark pits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel bad,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI feel like hell,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù

We looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the moonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the mountain. Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort. Below to the left was the river. It was high from the rain, and black and smooth. Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out. Brett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to walk back?‚Äù

‚ÄúThrough the park.‚Äù

We climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark under the trees.

‚ÄúDo you still love me, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm a goner,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a goner. I‚Äôm mad about the Romero boy. I‚Äôm in love with him, I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be if I were you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it. I‚Äôm a goner. It‚Äôs tearing me all up inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it. I‚Äôve never been able to help anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ought to stop it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can I stop it? I can‚Äôt stop things. Feel that?‚Äù

Her hand was trembling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm like that all through.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou oughtn‚Äôt to do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it. I‚Äôm a goner now, anyway. Don‚Äôt you see the difference?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to do something. I‚Äôve got to do something I really want to do. I‚Äôve lost my self-respect.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, darling, don‚Äôt be difficult. What do you think it‚Äôs meant to have that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he‚Äôs acted?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just stay tight all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, darling, please stay by me. Please stay by me and see me through this.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs right. It is right though for me. God knows, I‚Äôve never felt such a bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go and find him.‚Äù

Together we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under the trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the street that led into town.

Pedro Romero was in the caf√©. He was at a table with other bull-fighters and bull-fight critics. They were smoking cigars. When we came in they looked up. Romero smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down the room.

‚ÄúAsk him to come over and have a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet. He‚Äôll come over.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look at him.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs nice to look at,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always done just what I wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do feel such a bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúMy God!‚Äù said Brett, ‚Äúthe things a woman goes through.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I do feel such a bitch.‚Äù

I looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled. He said something to the other people at his table, and stood up. He came over to our table. I stood up and we shook hands.

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you have a drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou must have a drink with me,‚Äù he said. He seated himself, asking Brett‚Äôs permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners. But he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face.

‚ÄúYou like cigars?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOh, yes. I always smoke cigars.‚Äù

It was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt there was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake.

‚ÄúYou fight to-morrow?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlgabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBadly?‚Äù

He shook his head.

‚ÄúNothing. Here,‚Äù he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the fingers apart.

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù he said in English, ‚Äúyou tell fortunes?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes. Do you mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I like it.‚Äù He spread his hand flat on the table. ‚ÄúTell me I live for always, and be a millionaire.‚Äù

He was still very polite, but he was surer of himself. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúdo you see any bulls in my hand?‚Äù

He laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small.

‚ÄúThere are thousands of bulls,‚Äù Brett said. She was not at all nervous now. She looked lovely.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Romero laughed. ‚ÄúAt a thousand duros apiece,‚Äù he said to me in Spanish. ‚ÄúTell me some more.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good hand,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôll live a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it to me. Not to your friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said you‚Äôd live a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it,‚Äù Romero said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never going to die.‚Äù

I tapped with my finger-tips on the table. Romero saw it. He shook his head.

‚ÄúNo. Don‚Äôt do that. The bulls are my best friends.‚Äù

I translated to Brett.

‚ÄúYou kill your friends?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù he said in English, and laughed. ‚ÄúSo they don‚Äôt kill me.‚Äù He looked at her across the table.

‚ÄúYou know English well.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody know. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù asked Brett.

‚ÄúIt would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are bull-fighters like?‚Äù

He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle of his cigar and the expression of his face.

‚ÄúLike at the table,‚Äù he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly the expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. ‚ÄúNo. I must forget English.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget it, yet,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù

He laughed again.

‚ÄúI would like a hat like that,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll get you one.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. See that you do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will. I‚Äôll get you one to-night.‚Äù

I stood up. Romero rose, too.

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI must go and find our friends and bring them here.‚Äù

He looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It was understood all right.

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù Brett said to him. ‚ÄúYou must teach me Spanish.‚Äù

He sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out. The hard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go. It was not pleasant. When I came back and looked in the caf√©, twenty minutes later, Brett and Pedro Romero were gone. The coffee-glasses and our three empty cognac-glasses were on the table. A waiter came with a cloth and picked up the glasses and mopped off the table.





CHAPTER XVII


Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. Edna was the girl‚Äôs name.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been thrown out,‚Äù Edna said.

‚ÄúBy the police,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people in there that don‚Äôt like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept them out of four fights,‚Äù Edna said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to help me.‚Äù

Bill‚Äôs face was red.

‚ÄúCome back in, Edna,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGo on in there and dance with Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs silly,‚Äù Edna said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll just be another row.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamned Biarritz swine,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúAfter all, it‚Äôs a pub. They can‚Äôt occupy a whole pub.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood old Mike,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúDamned English swine come here and insult Mike and try and spoil the fiesta.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so bloody,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI hate the English.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt insult Mike,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúMike is a swell fellow. They can‚Äôt insult Mike. I won‚Äôt stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?‚Äù His voice broke.

‚ÄúWho cares?‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Jake doesn‚Äôt care. Do you care?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Edna said. ‚ÄúAre you a bankrupt?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I am. You don‚Äôt care, do you, Bill?‚Äù

Bill put his arm around Mike‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúI wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I‚Äôd show those bastards.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just English,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúIt never makes any difference what the English say.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dirty swine,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to clean them out.‚Äù

‚ÄúBill,‚Äù Edna looked at me. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt go in again, Bill. They‚Äôre so stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre stupid. I knew that was what it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt say things like that about Mike,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúDo you know them?‚Äù I asked Mike.

‚ÄúNo. I never saw them. They say they know me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt stand it,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs go over to the Suizo,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a bunch of Edna‚Äôs friends from Biarritz,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre simply stupid,‚Äù Edna said.

‚ÄúOne of them‚Äôs Charley Blackman, from Chicago,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúI was never in Chicago,‚Äù Mike said.

Edna started to laugh and could not stop.

‚ÄúTake me away from here,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou bankrupts.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of a row was it?‚Äù I asked Edna. We were walking across the square to the Suizo. Bill was gone.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep Mike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes. What‚Äôs the matter with Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably he owes them money,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what people usually get bitter about.‚Äù

In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting. They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground with blankets and newspapers around them. They were waiting for the wickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. The night was clearing and the moon was out. Some of the people in the line were sleeping.

At the Caf√© Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert Cohn came up.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Brett?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe must have gone to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where she is.‚Äù

His face was sallow under the light. He was standing up.

‚ÄúTell me where she is.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where she is.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hell you don‚Äôt!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can shut your face.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me where Brett is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll not tell you a damn thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know where she is.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I did I wouldn‚Äôt tell you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, go to hell, Cohn,‚Äù Mike called from the table. ‚ÄúBrett‚Äôs gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They‚Äôre on their honeymoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shut up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, go to hell!‚Äù Mike said languidly.

‚ÄúIs that where she is?‚Äù Cohn turned to me.

‚ÄúGo to hell!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was with you. Is that where she is?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to hell!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you tell me‚Äù‚Äîhe stepped forward‚Äî‚Äúyou damned pimp.‚Äù

I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him. Mike helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my head. Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair. Mike was pulling at my ears.

‚ÄúI say, you were cold,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúWhere the hell were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I was around.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want to mix in it?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe knocked Mike down, too,‚Äù Edna said.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt knock me out,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI just lay there.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes this happen every night at your fiestas?‚Äù Edna asked. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt that Mr. Cohn?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm all right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMy head‚Äôs a little wobbly.‚Äù

There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around.

‚ÄúVaya!‚Äù said Mike. ‚ÄúGet away. Go on.‚Äù

The waiters moved the people away.

‚ÄúIt was quite a thing to watch,‚Äù Edna said. ‚ÄúHe must be a boxer.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish Bill had been here,‚Äù Edna said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to have seen Bill knocked down, too. I‚Äôve always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He‚Äôs so big.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was hoping he would knock down a waiter,‚Äù Mike said, ‚Äúand get arrested. I‚Äôd like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh, no,‚Äù said Edna. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do, though,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not one of these chaps likes being knocked about. I never play games, even.‚Äù

Mike took a drink.

‚ÄúI never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nice,‚Äù Edna said to Mike. ‚ÄúAre you really a bankrupt?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a tremendous bankrupt,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI owe money to everybody. Don‚Äôt you owe any money?‚Äù

‚ÄúTons.‚Äù

‚ÄúI owe everybody money,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI borrowed a hundred pesetas from Montoya to-night.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hell you did,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay it back,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI always pay everything back.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre a bankrupt, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Edna said.

I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed like some bad play.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over to the hotel,‚Äù I said. Then I heard them talking about me.

‚ÄúIs he all right?‚Äù Edna asked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd better walk with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm all right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come. I‚Äôll see you all later.‚Äù

I walked away from the caf√©. They were sitting at the table. I looked back at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands.

Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and changed. I had never seen the trees before. I had never seen the flagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre. It was all different. I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. I was carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it was all new. They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road, and I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away. I had been kicked in the head early in the game. It was like that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. Bill came out and met me in the hall.

‚ÄúSay,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúgo up and see Cohn. He‚Äôs been in a jam, and he‚Äôs asking for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hell with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on. Go on up and see him.‚Äù

I did not want to climb another flight of stairs.

‚ÄúWhat are you looking at me that way for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He‚Äôs in bad shape.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were drunk a little while ago,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm drunk now,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúBut you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the hall to Cohn‚Äôs room. The door was shut and I knocked.

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúBarnes.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in, Jake.‚Äù

I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. There was no light in the room. Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.

‚ÄúHello, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me Jake.‚Äù

I stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it was a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the bathroom?‚Äù I asked.

Cohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying.

He had on a white polo shirt, the kind he‚Äôd worn at Princeton.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jake. Please forgive me.‚Äù

‚ÄúForgive you, hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease forgive me, Jake.‚Äù

I did not say anything. I stood there by the door.

‚ÄúI was crazy. You must see how it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stand it about Brett.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou called me a pimp.‚Äù

I did not care. I wanted a hot bath. I wanted a hot bath in deep water.

‚ÄúI know. Please don‚Äôt remember it. I was crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all right.‚Äù

He was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark. His polo shirt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going away in the morning.‚Äù

He was crying without making any noise.

‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt stand it about Brett. I‚Äôve been through hell, Jake. It‚Äôs been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as though I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn‚Äôt stand it. We lived together at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can‚Äôt stand it any more.‚Äù

He lay there on the bed.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a bath.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúso long.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess it isn‚Äôt any use,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI guess it isn‚Äôt any damn use.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything. Please say you forgive me, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúI felt so terribly. I‚Äôve been through such hell, Jake. Now everything‚Äôs gone. Everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúso long. I‚Äôve got to go.‚Äù

He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up.

‚ÄúSo long, Jake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll shake hands, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. Why not?‚Äù

We shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúsee you in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going away in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù I said.

I went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room.

‚ÄúAre you all right, Jake?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all right.‚Äù

I could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a deep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat down on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had taken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them down-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed.

I woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the street. I remembered I had promised to take Bill‚Äôs friend Edna to see the bulls go through the street and into the ring. I dressed and went down-stairs and out into the cold early morning. People were crossing the square, hurrying toward the bullring. Across the square were the two lines of men in front of the ticket-booths. They were still waiting for the tickets to go on sale at seven o‚Äôclock. I hurried across the street to the caf√©. The waiter told me that my friends had been there and gone.

‚ÄúHow many were they?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo gentlemen and a lady.‚Äù

That was all right. Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid last night they would pass out. That was why I was to be sure to take her. I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the bull-ring. I was not groggy now. There was only a bad headache. Everything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early morning.

The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bullring was muddy. There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with people. I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in time to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the fence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They walked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come running. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed him over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long running pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He wanted to do capework with the bulls. The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running crowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man‚Äôs arms were by his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted him and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front, but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were pressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.

The man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud. People climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd was so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was happening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the bulls out of the ring and into the corrals. I left the fence and started back toward the town.

Back in the town I went to the caf√© to have a second coffee and some buttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the caf√© and mopping off the tables. One came over and took my order.

‚ÄúAnything happen at the encierro?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it all. One man was badly cogido.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my chest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The waiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his cloth.

‚ÄúBadly cogido,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll for sport. All for pleasure.‚Äù

He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots. He poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two streams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head.

‚ÄúBadly cogido through the back,‚Äù he said. He put the pots down on the table and sat down in the chair at the table. ‚ÄúA big horn wound. All for fun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. All for fun. Fun, you understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not an aficionado?‚Äù

‚ÄúMe? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals.‚Äù He stood up and put his hand on the small of his back. ‚ÄúRight through the back. A cornada right through the back. For fun‚Äîyou understand.‚Äù

He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men were going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were grave-looking. One shook his head. ‚ÄúMuerto!‚Äù he called.

The waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some errand. The waiter came over to my table.

‚ÄúYou hear? Muerto. Dead. He‚Äôs dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot for me,‚Äù the waiter said. ‚ÄúNo fun in that for me.‚Äù

Later in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named Vicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla. The next day in the paper we read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and two children. He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he was married. The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the body, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin, and the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the dancing and drinking society of Tafalla. The drums marched ahead, and there was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin walked the wife and two children . . . . Behind them marched all the members of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella, Tafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral. The coffin was loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two children rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class railway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly, going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.

The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118 of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Taberno, and was killed by Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti cigarettestubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona.

Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the door. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I came in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been to the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I followed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and lay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the sunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have been half past three o‚Äôclock when I had gone to bed and the bands had waked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb and fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved him. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one knocked on the door.

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

It was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed.

‚ÄúSome encierro,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúSome encierro.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, weren‚Äôt you there?‚Äù Mike asked. ‚ÄúRing for some beer, Bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a morning!‚Äù Bill said. He mopped off his face. ‚ÄúMy God! what a morning! And here‚Äôs old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood God!‚Äù Bill said, ‚Äúwhat happened, Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere were these bulls coming in,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúJust ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the bulls all came in right over them,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúI heard them yell.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was Edna,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúChaps kept coming out and waving their shirts.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey took about twenty chaps to the infirmary,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúWhat a morning!‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúThe damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe steers took them in, in the end,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúIt took about an hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was really about a quarter of an hour,‚Äù Mike objected.

‚ÄúOh, go to hell,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been in the war. It was two hours and a half for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that beer?‚Äù Mike asked.

‚ÄúWhat did you do with the lovely Edna?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe took her home just now. She‚Äôs gone to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did she like it?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. We told her it was just like that every morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was impressed,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúShe wanted us to go down in the ring, too,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúShe likes action.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to my creditors,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúWhat a morning,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúAnd what a night!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your jaw, Jake?‚Äù Mike asked.

‚ÄúSore,‚Äù I said.

Bill laughed.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you hit him with a chair?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can talk,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd have knocked you out, too. I never saw him hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a table.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere did he go afterward?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHere she is,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the beautiful lady with the beer.‚Äù

The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on the table.

‚ÄúNow bring up three more bottles,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúWhere did Cohn go after he hit me?‚Äù I asked Bill.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know about that?‚Äù Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured the beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúWhy he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter‚Äôs room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a night!‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúHe nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to take Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene.‚Äù

He took a long drink of the beer.

‚ÄúHe is an ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather good.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet she was,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúThen Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. He shook hands with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he? Well, they weren‚Äôt having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow was rather good. He didn‚Äôt say much, but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again. Cohn couldn‚Äôt knock him out. It must have been damned funny.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere did you hear all this?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrett. I saw her this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened finally?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He‚Äôd been knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more. Brett held him and wouldn‚Äôt let him get up. He was weak, but Brett couldn‚Äôt hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn‚Äôt hit him again. Said he couldn‚Äôt do it. Said it would be wicked. So the bull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back against the wall.

‚Äú ‚ÄòSo you won‚Äôt hit me?‚Äô

‚Äú ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô said Cohn. ‚ÄòI‚Äôd be ashamed to.‚Äô

‚ÄúSo the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn‚Äôt get up, Brett said. Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn helped him he‚Äôd kill him, and he‚Äôd kill him anyway this morning if Cohn wasn‚Äôt out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he wanted to shake hands. I‚Äôve told you that before.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell the rest,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúIt seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn‚Äôt having any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned down to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you know. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face again.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite a kid,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúHe ruined Cohn,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt think Cohn will ever want to knock people about again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen did you see Brett?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis morning. She came in to get some things. She‚Äôs looking after this Romero lad.‚Äù

He poured out another bottle of beer.

‚ÄúBrett‚Äôs rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That‚Äôs how we came to go off together. She was looking after me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm rather drunk,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll stay rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it‚Äôs not too pleasant. It‚Äôs not too pleasant for me.‚Äù

He drank off the beer.

‚ÄúI gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble.‚Äù He leaned forward. ‚ÄúI say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours? She‚Äôll bring you another one.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt drinking it, anyway.‚Äù

Mike started to open the bottle. ‚ÄúWould you mind opening it?‚Äù I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Mike went on, ‚ÄúBrett was rather good. She‚Äôs always rather good. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all those sort of people, and do you know what she said: ‚ÄòYes. I‚Äôve had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!‚Äô ‚Äù

He took a drink.

‚ÄúThat was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a sailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn‚Äôt sleep in a bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really bad, he used to tell her he‚Äôd kill her. Always slept with a loaded service revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he‚Äôd gone to sleep. She hasn‚Äôt had an absolutely happy life, Brett. Damned shame, too. She enjoys things so.‚Äù

He stood up. His hand was shaky.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going in the room. Try and get a little sleep.‚Äù

He smiled.

‚ÄúWe go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I‚Äôm going to start now and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you frightfully nervy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see you at noon at the Iru√±a,‚Äù Bill said.

Mike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.

He rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door.

‚ÄúBring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador,‚Äù Mike told her.

‚ÄúS√≠, Se√±orito.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúPoor old Mike. I had a hell of a row about him last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere? At that Milano place?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes, once. He was damned nasty.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know the story.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes it bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey oughtn‚Äôt to have any right. I wish to hell they didn‚Äôt have any right. I‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas anybody killed in the ring?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. Just badly hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúA man was killed outside in the runway.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas there?‚Äù said Bill.





CHAPTER XVIII


At noon we were all at the caf√©. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing cars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it. They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta.

The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going. Inside the caf√©s men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other‚Äôs shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.

‚ÄúHere comes Brett,‚Äù Bill said.

I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing.

‚ÄúHello, you chaps!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI say, I have a thirst.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet another big beer,‚Äù Bill said to the waiter.

‚ÄúShrimps?‚Äù

‚ÄúIs Cohn gone?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúHe hired a car.‚Äù

The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook. She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.

‚ÄúGood beer.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery good,‚Äù I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control.

‚ÄúI heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúNo. Knocked me out. That was all.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, he did hurt Pedro Romero,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHe hurt him most badly.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be all right. He won‚Äôt go out of the room.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes he look badly?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he going to fight?‚Äù

‚ÄúRather. I‚Äôm going with you, if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your boy friend?‚Äù Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said.

‚ÄúBrett‚Äôs got a bull-fighter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly.‚Äù

Brett stood up.

‚ÄúI am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your boy friend?‚Äù

‚ÄúDamned well,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúWatch him this afternoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrett‚Äôs got a bull-fighter,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúA beautiful, bloody bull-fighter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell him all about your bull-fighter,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúOh, to hell with your bull-fighter!‚Äù He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of this.‚Äù

In the crowd crossing the square I said: ‚ÄúHow is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come in and dress him. They‚Äôre very angry about me, he says.‚Äù

Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright.

‚ÄúI feel altogether changed,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve no idea, Jake,‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything you want me to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, just go to the fight with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see you at lunch?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm eating with him.‚Äù

We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.

‚ÄúWant to take a turn out to the park?‚Äù Brett asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go up yet. I fancy he‚Äôs sleeping.‚Äù

We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate. We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let‚Äôs go there,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want staring at just now.‚Äù

We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea.

‚ÄúI hope the wind goes down,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very bad for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo do I.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe says the bulls are all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre good.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that San Fermin‚Äôs?‚Äù

Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.

‚ÄúYes. Where the show started on Sunday.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go in. Do you mind? I‚Äôd rather like to pray a little for him or something.‚Äù

We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It was dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long wooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she whispered throatily. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here. Makes me damned nervous.‚Äù

Outside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know why I get so nervy in church,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúNever does me any good.‚Äù

We walked along.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm damned bad for a religious atmosphere,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve the wrong type of face.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Brett said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish the wind would drop, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs liable to go down by five o‚Äôclock.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou might pray,‚Äù I laughed.

‚ÄúNever does me any good. I‚Äôve never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, rot,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúMaybe it works for some people, though you don‚Äôt look very religious, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty religious.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, rot,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start proselyting to-day. To-day‚Äôs going to be bad enough as it is.‚Äù

It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating.

‚ÄúDo look after Mike,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let him get too bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour frients haff gone up-stairs,‚Äù the German ma√Ætre d‚Äôh√¥tel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:

‚ÄúThank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Brett.

‚ÄúSave us a table for three,‚Äù I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile.

‚ÄúIss madam eating here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúDen I think a tabul for two will be enuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to him,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúMike must have been in bad shape,‚Äù she said on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you at the caf√©,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúThank you, so much, Jake.‚Äù

We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down the hall and into Romero‚Äôs room. She did not knock. She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her.

I stood in front of the door of Mike‚Äôs room and knocked. There was no answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There were empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me.

‚ÄúHello, Jake,‚Äù he said very slowly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a little sleep. I‚Äôve want ed a little sleep for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me cover you over.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm quite warm.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go. I have n‚Äôt got ten to sleep yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll sleep, Mike. Don‚Äôt worry, boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrett‚Äôs got a bull-fighter,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúBut her Jew has gone away.‚Äù

He turned his head and looked at me.

‚ÄúDamned good thing, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just starting. I‚Äôm going to get a little sleep.‚Äù

He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly. Bill was in my room reading the paper. ‚ÄúSee Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go and eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was snotty to us, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out and eat in the town.‚Äù

We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray.

‚ÄúThere goes Brett‚Äôs lunch,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúAnd the kid‚Äôs,‚Äù I said.

Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up. His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.

‚ÄúI haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúGo sit at it,‚Äù Bill said. We went on out across the street.

We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all men eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much. Afterward we went to the caf√© and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked in the room and that Mike was asleep.

When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the crowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of the barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front, beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow. It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and firm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as the leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched it all. She was absorbed in the professional details.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy do they call them muletas?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wonder if they ever launder them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. It might spoil the color.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe blood must stiffen them,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúFunny,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHow one doesn‚Äôt mind the blood.‚Äù

Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full. There was not an empty seat except in the President‚Äôs box. When he came in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.

‚ÄúHere, would you like to look?‚Äù

I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan and yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were all alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The music started. Brett looked through the glasses.

‚ÄúHere, take them,‚Äù she said.

Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bullring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President‚Äôs box, and then came over to the barrera below us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero‚Äôs lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape.

‚ÄúSpread it out in front of you,‚Äù I said.

Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold. The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man beside me leaned over toward Brett.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt want you to spread it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou should fold it and keep it in your lap.‚Äù

Brett folded the heavy cape.

Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over the barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that for?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúTo give it weight in the wind.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis face looks bad,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúHe feels very badly,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúHe should be in bed.‚Äù

The first bull was Belmonte‚Äôs. Belmonte was very good. But because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good. Belmonte‚Äôs great attraction is working close to the bull. In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy. People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls. When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.

Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded and cheated, and Belmonte‚Äôs jaw came further out in contempt, and his face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was utterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults, and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables, thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs. His jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that toothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms, not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into the ring.

Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him. Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He paid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by the false aesthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American ambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.

Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon. Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.

His first ‚Äúquite‚Äù was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull‚Äôs eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull‚Äôs shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull‚Äôs shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.

The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The bull‚Äôs tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero‚Äôs cape filled again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep. He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away.

In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they change him?‚Äù Brett asked.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve paid for him. They don‚Äôt want to lose their money.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hardly fair to Romero.‚Äù

‚ÄúWatch how he handles a bull that can‚Äôt see the color.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the sort of thing I don‚Äôt like to see.‚Äù

It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull‚Äôs charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not like it. They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull‚Äôs charge from his own body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte‚Äôs imitation of himself or Marcial‚Äôs imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row behind us.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he afraid of the bull for? The bull‚Äôs so dumb he only goes after the cloth.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a young bull-fighter. He hasn‚Äôt learned it yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I thought he was fine with the cape before.‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably he‚Äôs nervous now.‚Äù

Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with that little, almost imperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to kill now,‚Äù I said to Brett. ‚ÄúThe bull‚Äôs still strong. He wouldn‚Äôt wear himself out.‚Äù

Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero‚Äôs left hand dropped the muleta over the bull‚Äôs muzzle to blind him, his left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull‚Äôs shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.

‚ÄúThere he goes,‚Äù Bill said.

Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.

They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President‚Äôs box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta.

‚ÄúBad one,‚Äù said the sword-handler.

‚ÄúHe made me sweat,‚Äù said Romero. He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.

Marcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero‚Äôs last bull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running.

During Romero‚Äôs first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable. Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out. The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls.

When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow, templed and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.

The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero‚Äôs older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull‚Äôs neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid. Romero‚Äôs brother, holding the bull‚Äôs horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President‚Äôs box. Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bullring. The President looked down from the box and waved his handkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance around the bull.

Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the crowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him. Brett held down the cape.

‚ÄúYou liked it?‚Äù Romero called.

Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett had the ear in her hand.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get bloody,‚Äù Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people‚Äôs shoulders. But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody‚Äôs shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him.

We all three went back to the hotel. Brett went upstairs. Bill and I sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate. Belmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o‚Äôclock train for Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk. He only answered questions.

Bill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bull-fight very hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people at his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.

‚ÄúCome on over to the caf√©,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúI want an absinthe.‚Äù

It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems. Outside the caf√© there was a great crowd. The music and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Edna?‚Äù I asked Bill.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta. The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.

‚ÄúI feel sorry about Cohn,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúHe had an awful time.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, to hell with Cohn,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhere do you suppose he went?‚Äù

‚ÄúUp to Paris.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you suppose he‚Äôll do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, to hell with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you suppose he‚Äôll do?‚Äù

‚ÄúPick up with his old girl, probably.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was his old girl?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomebody named Frances.‚Äù

We had another absinthe.

‚ÄúWhen do you go back?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTo-morrow.‚Äù

After a little while Bill said: ‚ÄúWell, it was a swell fiesta.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said; ‚Äúsomething doing all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs like a wonderful nightmare.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd believe anything. Including nightmares.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? Feel low?‚Äù

‚ÄúLow as hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this se√±or.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like hell,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDrink that,‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúDrink it slow.‚Äù

It was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel drunk but I did not feel any better.

‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave another?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt do any good.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry it. You can‚Äôt tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this se√±or!‚Äù

I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture.

‚ÄúHow is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink it fast that way. It will make you sick.‚Äù

I set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast.

‚ÄúI feel tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ought to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you wanted, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm tight. Is that what you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt sit down,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over to the hotel.‚Äù

I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett‚Äôs door was open. I put my head in the room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.

‚ÄúJake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCome in, Jake.‚Äù

I went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some fixed point.

‚ÄúBrett, you know. She‚Äôs gone off with the bull-fighter chap.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o‚Äôclock train.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid they?‚Äù

‚ÄúBad thing to do,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúShe shouldn‚Äôt have done it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm drunk,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going in and lie down.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you blind? I was blind myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm blind.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, bung-o,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúGet some sleep, old Jake.‚Äù

I went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it stop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean anything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with them. I pretended to be asleep.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs asleep. Better let him alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs blind as a tick,‚Äù Mike said. They went out.

I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the square. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room.

‚ÄúHere he is!‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúGood old Jake! I knew you wouldn‚Äôt pass out.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, you old drunk,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúI got hungry and woke up.‚Äù

‚ÄúEat some soup,‚Äù Bill said.

The three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six people were missing.

CHAPTER XIX


In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about nine o‚Äôclock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was empty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were picking up rocket-sticks in the square. The caf√©s were just opening and the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.

I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The waiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were still up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing away the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over.

I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come walking across the square. He sat down at the table and ordered a coffee.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all over.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhen do you go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. We better get a car, I think. Aren‚Äôt you going back to Paris?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I can stay away another week. I think I‚Äôll go to San Sebastian.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to get back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Mike going to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to Saint Jean de Luz.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up from there to-night.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Let‚Äôs go after lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right. I‚Äôll get the car.‚Äù

We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the maids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from Pamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet, green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill‚Äôs baggage at the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at seven-ten. We came out of the station. The car was standing out in front.

‚ÄúWhat shall we do about the car?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúOh, bother the car,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just keep the car with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúWhere shall we go?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to Biarritz and have a drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúOld Mike the spender,‚Äù Bill said.

We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda.

‚ÄúThat drink‚Äôs mine,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs roll for it.‚Äù

So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out first roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc note. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar. We had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill and Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the second. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there were three kings, an ace, and a queen.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours, Mike,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúOld Mike, the gambler.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve no money,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stony. I‚Äôve just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs.‚Äù

Bill‚Äôs face sort of changed.

‚ÄúI just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll cash you a check,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs damned nice of you, but you see I can‚Äôt write checks.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do for money?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, some will come through. I‚Äôve two weeks allowance should be here. I can live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want to do about the car?‚Äù Bill asked me. ‚ÄúDo you want to keep it on?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs have another drink,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúFine. This one is on me,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúHas Brett any money?‚Äù He turned to Mike.

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt any money with her?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose they get it at the source,‚Äù said Bill.

‚ÄúQuite. They‚Äôre not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They‚Äôre Scotsmen, I believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúHasn‚Äôt she any at all with her?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Bill said, ‚Äúwe might as well have another drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamned good idea,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúOne never gets anywhere by discussing finances.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost and paid. We went out to the car.

‚ÄúAnywhere you‚Äôd like to go, Mike?‚Äù Bill asked.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let‚Äôs drive about a little.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôd like to see the coast. Let‚Äôs drive down toward Hendaye.‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt any credit along the coast.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt ever tell,‚Äù said Bill.

We drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea.

At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the side of the car.

‚ÄúGood-bye, you chaps,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúIt was a damned fine fiesta.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo long, Mike,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you around,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about money,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúYou can pay for the car, Jake, and I‚Äôll send you my share.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo long, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo long, you chaps. You‚Äôve been damned nice.‚Äù

We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried Bill‚Äôs bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks.

‚ÄúSo long, fella,‚Äù Bill said.

‚ÄúSo long, kid!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was swell. I‚Äôve had a swell time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you be in Paris?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo long, old kid!‚Äù

He went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the bags. I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty. I went outside to the car.

‚ÄúHow much do we owe you?‚Äù I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.

‚ÄúTwo hundred pesetas.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way back?‚Äù

‚ÄúFifty pesetas.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kid me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThirty-five pesetas.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not worth it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDrive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri.‚Äù

At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the car in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the road to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That seemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town.

At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a caf√© to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does not open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and swim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with their nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be band concerts under the trees across from the Caf√© Marinas. I could sit in the Marinas and listen.

‚ÄúHow does one eat inside?‚Äù I asked the waiter. Inside the caf√© was a restaurant.

‚ÄúWell. Very well. One eats very well.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was a Ch√¢teau Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a liqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the Pyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil and smelled like Italian strega. I told him to take the flowers of the Pyrenees away and bring me a vieux marc. The marc was good. I had a second marc after the coffee.

The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees, so I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis. I was back in France.

Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not think I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there again. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be loyal.

At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport, opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate, climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was at San Sebastian.

Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel as though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on certain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened out above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond the roofs.

I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an hour by coming to San Sebastian.

As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police bulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms, and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all mail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I would be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six days. Then I went in and had lunch.

After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When I woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the Concha. The tide was about halfway out. The beach was smooth and firm, and the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm under bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the beach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like undulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke smoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the chill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot planks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay face downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he said, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun until I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming down to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark. The raft made a dark shadow. I came out of the water beside the raft, pulled up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off my suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.

I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up one of the cool streets to the Caf√© Marinas. There was an orchestra playing inside the caf√© and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved ice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for a long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.

Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping that night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers. They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their meal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre chic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them. The next morning at five o‚Äôclock the race resumed with the last lap, San Sebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except among themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did not make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The money could be arranged.

The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack of boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His neck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders joked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork.

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúto-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze.‚Äù

One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned red. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.

I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big bicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at Pamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than in France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said. Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de France was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and organizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know France. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with bicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed the riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and more sportif every year. It would be the most sportif country in the world. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew France. La France Sportive. He knew road-racing. We had a cognac. After all, though, it wasn‚Äôt bad to get back to Paris. There is only one Paname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most sportif in the world. Did I know the Chope de Negre? Did I not. I would see him there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another fine together. We certainly would. They started at six o‚Äôclock less a quarter in the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to. Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a call at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take the trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until the next morning.

In the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars had been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed and then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything was fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and in peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish children were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree talking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and there was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.

I undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach and went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers, but having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and floated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the swells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big roller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have a wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I turned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt as though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long swim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat, dripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked around at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the promenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered names. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill with a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the other side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high headland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid of cramp.

I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very small. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and swam slowly and steadily in to shore.

After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to the hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of L‚ÄôAuto around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French sporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a blue envelope in his hand.

‚ÄúA telegram for you, sir.‚Äù

I poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it open, and read it. It had been forwarded from Paris:

COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.

I tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming along the sidewalk. He turned into the hotel. He had a big moustache and looked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was just behind him.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs another telegram for you, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said.

I opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona.

COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.

The concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably.

‚ÄúWhat time is there a train for Madrid?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt left at nine this morning. There is a slow train at eleven, and the Sud Express at ten to-night.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust as you wish,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI will have it put on the bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo that.‚Äù

Well, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell. I suppose, vaguely, I had expected something of the sort. I saw the concierge standing in the doorway.

‚ÄúBring me a telegram form, please.‚Äù

He brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed:

LADY ASHLEY HOTEL MONTANA MADRID ARRIVING SUD EXPRESS TOMORROW LOVE JAKE.

That seemed to handle it. That was it. Send a girl off with one man. Introduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love. That was it all right. I went in to lunch.

I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country between Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.

The Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish there. They don‚Äôt go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line of hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we climbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished church on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high, hot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta del Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San Jeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The windows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped at the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The taxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could not make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a cut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I rang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door.

‚ÄúIs Lady Ashley here?‚Äù I asked.

She looked at me dully.

‚ÄúIs an Englishwoman here?‚Äù

She turned and called some one inside. A very fat woman came to the door. Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face. She was short and commanding.

‚ÄúMuy buenos,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs there an Englishwoman here? I would like to see this English lady.‚Äù

‚ÄúMuy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her if she wishes to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe wishes to see me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe chica will ask her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is very hot.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is very hot in the summer in Madrid.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how cold in winter.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it is very cold in winter.‚Äù

Did I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana?

Of that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags were brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be stolen. Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana. In other fondas, yes. Not here. No. The personages of this establishment were rigidly selectioned. I was happy to hear it. Nevertheless I would welcome the upbringal of my bags.

The maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male English now, at once.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou see. It is as I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly.‚Äù

I followed the maid‚Äôs back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she knocked on a door.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù said Brett. ‚ÄúIs it you, Jake?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in. Come in.‚Äù

I opened the door. The maid closed it after me. Brett was in bed. She had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had servants.

‚ÄúDarling!‚Äù Brett said.

I went over to the bed and put my arms around her. She kissed me, and while she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else. She was trembling in my arms. She felt very small.

‚ÄúDarling! I‚Äôve had such a hell of a time.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you keep him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It isn‚Äôt the sort of thing one does. I don‚Äôt think I hurt him any.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were probably damn good for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe shouldn‚Äôt be living with any one. I realized that right away.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, hell!‚Äù she said, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not talk about it. Let‚Äôs never talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for a while, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes. They ragged him about me at the caf√©, I guess. He wanted me to grow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I‚Äôd look so like hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said it would make me more womanly. I‚Äôd look a fright.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, he got over that. He wasn‚Äôt ashamed of me long.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was it about being in trouble?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know whether I could make him go, and I didn‚Äôt have a sou to go away and leave him. He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I told him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn‚Äôt take his money, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, let‚Äôs not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do give me a cigarette.‚Äù

I lit the cigarette.

‚ÄúHe learned his English as a waiter in Gib.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wanted to marry me, finally.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I can‚Äôt even marry Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. It wasn‚Äôt that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn‚Äôt go away from him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from him. After I‚Äôd gotten more womanly, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ought to feel set up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. I‚Äôm all right again. He‚Äôs wiped out that damned Cohn.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôd have lived with him if I hadn‚Äôt seen it was bad for him. We got along damned well.‚Äù

‚ÄúOutside of your personal appearance.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôd have gotten used to that.‚Äù

She put out the cigarette.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thirty-four, you know. I‚Äôm not going to be one of these bitches that ruins children.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel rather set up.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

She looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I saw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She wouldn‚Äôt look up. I put my arms around her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let‚Äôs ever talk about it. Please don‚Äôt let‚Äôs ever talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDear Brett.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going back to Mike.‚Äù I could feel her crying as I held her close. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so damned nice and he‚Äôs so awful. He‚Äôs my sort of thing.‚Äù

She would not look up. I stroked her hair. I could feel her shaking.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be one of those bitches,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut, oh, Jake, please let‚Äôs never talk about it.‚Äù

We left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me pay the bill. The bill had been paid.

‚ÄúOh, well. Let it go,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter now.‚Äù

We rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for berths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the hotel for a cocktail. We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman shook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big hotel,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúBarmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs odd.‚Äù

‚ÄúBartenders have always been fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Brett said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs quite true. He is only nineteen. Isn‚Äôt it amazing?‚Äù

We touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar. They were coldly beaded. Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of Madrid.

‚ÄúI like an olive in a Martini,‚Äù I said to the barman.

‚ÄúRight you are, sir. There you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should have asked, you know.‚Äù

The barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our conversation. Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the wood. Then she picked it up. Her hand was steady enough to lift it after that first sip.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good. Isn‚Äôt it a nice bar?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all nice bars.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I didn‚Äôt believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in school in Paris, then. Think of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything you want me to think about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an ass. Would you buy a lady a drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have two more Martinis.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs they were before, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were very good.‚Äù Brett smiled at him.

‚ÄúThank you, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, bung-o,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúBung-o!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Brett said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got plenty of time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it was you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. It was me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt going to ever talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can I help it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll lose it if you talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of what we have instead of God.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people have God,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúQuite a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe never worked very well with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould we have another Martini?‚Äù

The barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh glasses.

‚ÄúWhere will we have lunch?‚Äù I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could feel the heat outside through the window.

‚ÄúHere?‚Äù asked Brett.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin‚Äôs?‚Äù I asked the barman.

‚ÄúYes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

We lunched up-stairs at Botin‚Äôs. It is one of the best restaurants in the world. We had roast young suckling pig and drank rioja alta. Brett did not eat much. She never ate much. I ate a very big meal and drank three bottles of rioja alta.

‚ÄúHow do you feel, Jake?‚Äù Brett asked. ‚ÄúMy God! what a meal you‚Äôve eaten.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel fine. Do you want a dessert?‚Äù

‚ÄúLord, no.‚Äù

Brett was smoking.

‚ÄúYou like to eat, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI like to do a lot of things.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you like to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI like to do a lot of things. Don‚Äôt you want a dessert?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou asked me that once,‚Äù Brett said.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSo I did. Let‚Äôs have another bottle of rioja alta.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt drunk much of it,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI have. You haven‚Äôt seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get two bottles,‚Äù I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in my glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched glasses.

‚ÄúBung-o!‚Äù Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put her hand on my arm.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get drunk, Jake,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting drunk,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get drunk,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJake, don‚Äôt get drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to go for a ride?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWant to ride through the town?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Brett said. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen Madrid. I should see Madrid.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll finish this,‚Äù I said.

Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the street. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked. A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The driver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me. We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via.

‚ÄúOh, Jake,‚Äù Brett said, ‚Äúwe could have had such a damned good time together.‚Äù

Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it pretty to think so?‚Äù



THE END
