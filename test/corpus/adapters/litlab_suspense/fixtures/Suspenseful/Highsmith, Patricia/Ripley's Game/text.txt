RIPLEY‚ÄôS GAME
By Patricia Highsmith

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a perfect murder,‚Äù Tom said to Reeves. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a parlor game, trying to dream one up. Of course you could say there are a lot of unsolved murders. That‚Äôs different.‚Äù Tom was bored. He walked up and down in front of his big fireplace, where a small but cozy fire crackled. Tom felt he had spoken in a stuffy, pontificating way. But the point was, he couldn‚Äôt help Reeves, and he‚Äôd already told him that.

‚ÄúYes, sure,‚Äù said Reeves. He was sitting in one of the yellow silk armchairs, his lean figure hunched forward, hands clasped between his knees. He had a bony face, short, light-brown hair, cold gray eyes‚Äînot a pleasant face but a face that might have been rather handsome if not for a scar that traveled five inches from his right temple across his cheek almost to his mouth. Slightly pinker than the rest of his face, the scar looked like a bad job of stitching, or as if perhaps it had never been stitched. Tom had never asked about the scar, but Reeves had volunteered once, ‚ÄúA girl did it with her compact. Can you imagine?‚Äù (No, Tom couldn‚Äôt.) Reeves had given Tom a quick, sad smile, one of the few smiles Tom could recall from Reeves. And on another occasion, ‚ÄúI was thrown from a horse‚Äîdragged by the stirrup for a few yards.‚Äù Reeves had said that to someone else, but Tom had been present. Tom suspected a dull knife in a very nasty fight somewhere.

Now Reeves wanted Tom to provide someone, suggest someone to do one or perhaps two ‚Äúsimple murders‚Äù and perhaps one theft, also safe and simple. Reeves had come from Hamburg to Villeperce to talk to Tom, and he was going to stay the night and go to Paris tomorrow to talk to someone else about it, then return to his home in Hamburg, presumably to do some more thinking if he failed. Reeves was primarily a fence, but lately was dabbling in the illegal gambling world of Hamburg, which he was now undertaking to protect. Protect from what? Italian sharks who wanted to come in. One Italian in Hamburg was a Mafia button man, sent out as a feeler, Reeves thought, and the other might be, from a different family. By eliminating one or both of these intruders, Reeves hoped to discourage further Mafia attempts, and also to draw the attention of the Hamburg police to a Mafia threat, and let the police handle the rest, which was to say, throw the Mafia out. ‚ÄúThese Hamburg boys are a decent batch,‚Äù Reeves had declared fervently. ‚ÄúMaybe what they‚Äôre doing is illegal, running a couple of private casinos, but as clubs they‚Äôre not illegal, and they‚Äôre not taking outrageous profits. It‚Äôs not like Las Vegas, all Mafia-corrupted, and right under the noses of the American cops!‚Äù

Tom took the poker and pushed the fire together, put another neatly cut third-of-a-log on. It was nearly 6 p.m. Soon be time for a drink. And why not now? ‚ÄúWould you‚Äî‚Äù

Mme. Annette, the Ripleys‚Äô housekeeper, came in from the kitchen hall just then. ‚ÄúExcuse me, messieurs. Would you like your drinks now, M. Tome, since the gentleman has not wanted any tea?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, thank you, Mme. Annette. Just what I was thinking. And ask Mme. Heloise to join us, would you?‚Äù Tom wanted Heloise to lighten the atmosphere a little. He had said to Heloise, before he went to Orly at 3 p.m. to fetch Reeves, that Reeves wanted to talk to him about something, so Heloise had pottered about in the garden or stayed upstairs all afternoon.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù Reeves said with a last-minute urgency and hope, ‚Äúconsider taking it on yourself? You‚Äôre not connected, you see, and that‚Äôs what we want. Safety. And after all, the money, ninety-six thousand bucks, isn‚Äôt bad.‚Äù

Tom shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm connected with you‚Äîin a way.‚Äù Dammit, he‚Äôd done little jobs for Reeves Minot, like posting on small, stolen items, or recovering from toothpaste tubes, where Reeves had planted them, tiny objects like microfilm rolls from the unsuspecting toothpaste carriers. ‚ÄúHow much of this cloak and dagger stuff do you think I can get away with? I‚Äôve got my reputation to protect, you know.‚Äù Tom felt like smiling at that, but at the same time his heart had quickened with genuine feeling, and he stood taller, conscious of the fine house in which he lived, of his secure existence now, six whole months after the Derwatt episode, a near-catastrophe from which he had escaped with no worse than a bit of suspicion upon him. Thin ice, yes, but the ice hadn‚Äôt broken through. Tom had accompanied the English Inspector Webster and a couple of forensic men to the Salzburg woods where he had cremated the body of the man presumed to be the painter Derwatt. Why had he crushed the skull, the police had asked. Tom could still wince when he thought of it, because he had done it to try to scatter and hide the upper teeth. The lower jaw had easily come away, and Tom had buried it at a distance. But the upper teeth‚Äî Some of them had been gathered by one of the forensic men, but there had been no record of Derwatt‚Äôs teeth with any dentist in London, Derwatt having been living (it was believed) in Mexico for the preceding six years. ‚ÄúIt seemed part of the cremation, part of the idea of reducing him to ashes,‚Äù Tom had replied. The cremated body had been Bernard‚Äôs. Yes, Tom could still shudder, as much at the danger of that moment as at the horror of his act, dropping a big stone on the charred skull. But at least he hadn‚Äôt killed Bernard. Bernard Tufts had been a suicide.

Tom said, ‚ÄúSurely among all the people you know, you can find somebody who can do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, and that would be a connection‚Äîmore than you. Oh, the people I know are sort of known,‚Äù Reeves said with a sad defeat in his voice. ‚ÄúYou know a lot of respectable people, Tom, people really in the clear, people above reproach.‚Äù

Tom laughed. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôre you going to get such people? Sometimes I think you‚Äôre out of your mind, Reeves.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! You know what I mean. Someone who‚Äôd do it for the money, just the money. They don‚Äôt have to be experts. We‚Äôd prepare the way. It‚Äôd be like‚Äîpublic assassinations. Someone who if he was questioned would look‚Äîabsolutely incapable of doing such a thing.‚Äù

Mme. Annette came in with the bar cart. The silver ice bucket shone. The cart squeaked slightly. Tom had been meaning to oil it for weeks. Tom might have gone on bantering with Reeves because Mme. Annette, bless her soul, didn‚Äôt understand English, but Tom was tired of the subject, and delighted by Mme. Annette‚Äôs interruption. Mme. Annette was in her sixties, from a Normandy family, fine of feature and sturdy of body, a gem of a servant. Tom could not imagine Belle Ombre functioning without her.

Then Heloise came in from the garden, and Reeves got to his feet. Heloise was wearing bell-bottom pink-and-red-striped dungarees with LEVI printed vertically down all the stripes. Her blonde hair swung long and loose. Tom saw the firelight glow in it and thought, ‚ÄúWhat purity compared to what we‚Äôve been talking about!‚Äù The light in her hair was gold, however, which made Tom think of money. Well, he didn‚Äôt really need any more money, even if the Derwatt picture sales, of which he got a percentage, would soon come to an end because there would be no more pictures. Tom still got a percentage from the Derwatt art supplies company, and that would continue. Then there was the modest but slowly increasing income from the Greenleaf securities which he had inherited by means of a will forged by Tom himself. Not to mention Heloise‚Äôs generous allowance from her father. No use being greedy. Tom detested murder unless it was absolutely necessary.

‚ÄúDid you have a good talk?‚Äù Heloise asked in English, and fell back gracefully onto the yellow sofa.

‚ÄúYes, thank you,‚Äù said Reeves.

The rest of the conversation was in French, because Heloise was not comfortable in English. Reeves did not know much French but he got along, and they were not talking about anything important: the garden, the mild winter that seemed really to have passed, because here it was early March and the daffodils were opening. Tom poured champagne for Heloise from one of the little bottles on the cart.

‚ÄúHow ees eet in Hambourg?‚Äù Heloise ventured again in English, and Tom saw amusement in her eyes as Reeves struggled to get out a conventional response in French.

It was not too cold in Hamburg either, and Reeves added that he had a garden also, as his ‚Äúpetite maison‚Äù found itself on the Alster which was water, that was to say a sort of bay where many people had homes with gardens and water, meaning they could have small boats if they wished.

Tom knew that Heloise disliked Reeves Minot, mistrusted him, that Reeves was the kind of person Heloise wanted Tom to avoid. Tom reflected with satisfaction that he could honestly say to Heloise tonight that he had declined to cooperate in the scheme that Reeves had proposed. Heloise was always worried about what her father would say. Her father, Jacques Plisson, was a millionaire pharmaceutical manufacturer, a Gaullist, the essence of French respectability. And he had never cared for Tom. ‚ÄúMy father will not stand for much more!‚Äù Heloise often warned Tom, but Tom knew she was more interested in his own safety than in hanging on to the allowance her father gave her, an allowance he frequently threatened to cut off, according to Heloise. She had lunch with her parents at their home in Chantilly once a week, usually Friday. If her father ever severed her allowance, they could not quite make it at Belle Ombre, Tom knew.

The dinner menu was m√©daillons de b≈ìuf, preceded by cold artichokes with Mme. Annette‚Äôs own sauce. Heloise had changed into a simple dress of pale blue. She sensed already, Tom thought, that Reeves had not got what he had come for. Before they all retired, Tom made sure that Reeves had everything he needed, and at what hour he would like tea or coffee brought to his room. Coffee at 8 a.m., Reeves said. Reeves had the guest room in the left center of the house, which gave Reeves the bathroom that was usually Heloise‚Äôs, but from which Mme. Annette had already removed Heloise‚Äôs toothbrush to Tom‚Äôs bathroom, off his own room.

‚ÄúI am glad he is going tomorrow. Why is he so tense?‚Äù Heloise asked, while brushing her teeth.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always tense.‚Äù Tom turned off the shower, stepped out and quickly enveloped himself in a big yellow towel. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why he‚Äôs thin‚Äîmaybe.‚Äù They were speaking in English, because Heloise was not shy about speaking English with him.

‚ÄúHow did you meet him?‚Äù

Tom couldn‚Äôt remember. When? Maybe five or six years ago. In Rome? Who was Reeves a friend of? Tom was too tired to think hard, and it didn‚Äôt matter. He had five or six such acquaintances, and would have been hard-pressed to say where he had met each and every one.

‚ÄúWhat did he want from you?‚Äù

Tom put his arm around Heloise‚Äôs waist, pressing the loose nightdress close to her body. He kissed her cool cheek. ‚ÄúSomething impossible. I said no. You can see that. He is disappointed.‚Äù

That night there was an owl, a lonely owl calling somewhere in the pines of the communal forest behind Belle Ombre. Tom lay with his left arm under Heloise‚Äôs neck, thinking. She fell asleep, and her breathing became slow and soft. Tom sighed, and went on thinking. But he was not thinking in a logical, constructive way. His second coffee was keeping him awake. He was remembering a party he had been to a month ago in Fontainebleau, an informal birthday party for a Mme.‚Äîwho? It was her husband‚Äôs name that Tom was interested in, an English name that might come to him in a few seconds. The man, the host, had been in his early thirties, and they had a small son. The house was a straight-up-and-down three-story, on a residential street in Fontainebleau, a patch of garden behind it. The man was a picture framer, that was why Tom had been dragged along by Pierre Gauthier, who had an art supply shop in the Rue Grande, where Tom bought his paints and brushes. Gauthier had said, ‚ÄúOh, come along with me, M. Reeply. Bring your wife! He wants a lot of people. He‚Äôs a little depressed . . . And anyway, since he makes frames, you might give him some business.‚Äù

Tom blinked in the darkness, and moved his head back a little so his eyelashes would not touch Heloise‚Äôs shoulder. He recalled a tall blond Englishman with a certain resentment and dislike, because in the kitchen, that gloomy kitchen with worn-out linoleum, smoke-stained tin ceiling with a nineteenth-century bas-relief pattern, this man had made an unpleasant remark to Tom. The man‚ÄîTrewbridge, Tewksbury?‚Äîhad said in an almost sneering way, ‚ÄúOh yes, I‚Äôve heard of you.‚Äù Tom had said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tom Ripley. I live in Villeperce,‚Äù and Tom had been about to ask him how long he‚Äôd been in Fontainebleau, thinking that perhaps an Englishman with a French wife might like to make acquaintance with an American with a French wife living not far away, but Tom‚Äôs venture had been met with rudeness. Trevanny? Wasn‚Äôt that his name? Blond, straight hair, rather Dutch-looking, but then the English often looked Dutch and vice versa.

What Tom was thinking of now, however, was what Gauthier had said later the same evening. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs depressed. He doesn‚Äôt mean to be unfriendly. He‚Äôs got some kind of blood disease‚Äîleukemia, I think. Pretty serious. Also as you can see from the house, he‚Äôs not doing too well.‚Äù Gauthier had a glass eye of a curious yellow-green color, obviously an attempt to match the real eye, but rather a failure. Gauthier‚Äôs false eye suggested the eye of a dead cat. One avoided looking at it, yet one‚Äôs eyes were hypnotically drawn to it, so Gauthier‚Äôs gloomy words, combined with his glass eye, had made a strong impression of Death upon Tom, and Tom had not forgotten.

Oh, yes, I‚Äôve heard of you. Did that mean that Trevanny or whatever his name was thought he was responsible for Bernard Tufts‚Äôs death, and before that Dickie Greenleaf‚Äôs? Or was the Englishman merely embittered against everyone because of his ailment? Dyspeptic, like a man with a constant stomachache? Now Tom recalled Trevanny‚Äôs wife, not a pretty but a rather interesting-looking woman with chestnut hair, friendly and outgoing, making an effort at that party in the small living room and the kitchen where no one had sat down on the few chairs available.

What Tom was thinking was: would this man take on such a job as Reeves was proposing? An interesting approach to Trevanny had occurred to Tom. It was an approach that might work with any man, if one prepared the ground, but in this case the ground was already prepared. Trevanny was seriously worried about his health. Tom‚Äôs idea was nothing more than a practical joke, he thought, a nasty one, but the man had been nasty to him. The joke might not last more than a day or so, until Trevanny could consult his doctor.

Tom was amused by his thoughts, and eased himself gently from Heloise, so that if he shook with repressed laughter for an instant, he wouldn‚Äôt awaken her. Suppose Trevanny was vulnerable, and carried out Reeves‚Äôs plan like a soldier, like a dream? Was it worth a try? Yes, because Tom had nothing to lose. Neither had Trevanny. Trevanny might gain. Reeves might gain‚Äîaccording to Reeves, but let Reeves figure that out, because what Reeves wanted seemed as vague to Tom as Reeves‚Äôs microfilm activities, which presumably had to do with international spying. Were governments aware of the insane antics of some of their spies? Of those whimsical, half-demented men flitting from Bucharest to Moscow and Washington with guns and microfilm‚Äîmen who might with the same enthusiasm have put their energies to international warfare in stamp-collecting, or in acquiring secrets of miniature electric trains?

So it was that some ten days later, on 22 March, Jonathan Trevanny, who lived in the Rue St. Merry, Fontainebleau, received a curious letter from his good friend Alan McNear. Alan, a Paris representative of an English electronics firm, had written the letter just before leaving for New York on a business assignment, and oddly the day after he had visited the Trevannys in Fontainebleau. Jonathan had expected‚Äîor rather not expected‚Äîa sort of thank-you letter from Alan for the send-off party Jonathan and Simone had given him, and Alan did write a few words of appreciation, but the paragraph that puzzled Jonathan went:

Jon, I was shocked at the news in regard to the old blood ailment, and am even now hoping it isn‚Äôt so. I was told that you knew, but weren‚Äôt telling any of your friends. Very noble of you, but what are friends for? You needn‚Äôt think we‚Äôll avoid you or that we‚Äôll think you‚Äôll become so melancholy that we won‚Äôt want to see you. Your friends (and I‚Äôm one) are here‚Äîalways. But I can‚Äôt write anything I want to say, really. I‚Äôll do better when I see you next, in a couple of months when I wangle myself a vacation, so forgive these inadequate words.

What was Alan talking about? Had his doctor, Dr. Perrier, said something to his friends, something he wouldn‚Äôt tell him? Something about not living much longer? Dr. Perrier hadn‚Äôt been to the party for Alan, but could Dr. Perrier have said something to someone else?

Had Dr. Perrier spoken to Simone? And was Simone keeping it from him, too?

As Jonathan thought of these possibilities, he was standing in his garden at 8:30 a.m., chilly under his sweater, his fingers smudged with earth. He‚Äôd best speak with Dr. Perrier today. No use with Simone. She might put up an act. But darling, what‚Äôre you talking about? Jonathan wasn‚Äôt sure he‚Äôd be able to tell if she was putting up an act or not.

And Dr. Perrier‚Äîcould he trust him? Dr. Perrier was always bouncing with optimism, which was fine if you had something minor‚Äîyou felt fifty percent better, even cured. But Jonathan knew he hadn‚Äôt anything minor. He had myeloid leukemia, characterized by an excess of yellow matter in the bone marrow. In the past five years, he‚Äôd had at least four blood transfusions per year. Every time he felt weak, he was supposed to get to his doctor, or to the Fontainebleau hospital for a transfusion. Dr. Perrier had said (and so had a specialist in Paris) that there would come a time when the decline might be swift, when transfusions wouldn‚Äôt do the trick any longer. Jonathan had read enough about his ailment to know that himself. No doctor as yet had come up with a cure for myeloid leukemia. On the average, it killed after six to twelve years, or six to eight even. Jonathan was entering his sixth year with it.

Jonathan set his fork back in the little brick structure, formerly an outside toilet, that served as a toolshed, then walked to his back steps. He paused with one foot on the first step and drew the fresh morning air into his lungs, thinking, ‚ÄúHow many weeks will I have to enjoy such mornings?‚Äù He remembered thinking the same thing last spring, however. Buck up, he told himself, he‚Äôd known for six years that he might not live to see thirty-five. Jonathan mounted the eight iron steps with a firm tread, already thinking that it was 8:52 a.m., and that he was due in his shop at 9 a.m. or a few minutes after.

Simone had gone off with Georges to the Ecole Maternelle, and the house was empty. Jonathan washed his hands at the sink and made use of the vegetable brush, which Simone would not have approved of, but he left the brush clean. The only other sink was in the bathroom on the top floor. There was no telephone in the house. He‚Äôd ring Dr. Perrier from his shop the first thing.

Jonathan walked to the Rue de la Paroisse and turned left, then went on to the Rue des Sablons which crossed it. In his shop, Jonathan dialed Dr. Perrier‚Äôs number, which he knew by heart.

The nurse said the doctor was booked up today, which Jonathan had expected.

‚ÄúBut this is urgent. It‚Äôs something that won‚Äôt take long. Just a question really‚Äîbut I must see him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are feeling weak, M. Trevanny?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I am,‚Äù Jonathan said at once.

He got an appointment for twelve noon. The hour had a certain doom about it.

Jonathan was a picture framer. He cut mats and glass, made frames, chose frames from his stock for clients who were undecided, and once in a blue moon, in buying old frames at auctions and from junk dealers, he got a picture that was of some interest with the frame, a picture which he could clean and put in his window and sell. But it wasn‚Äôt a lucrative business. He scraped along. Seven years ago he‚Äôd had a partner, another Englishman, from Manchester, and they had started an antique shop in Fontainebleau, dealing mainly in junk which they refurbished and sold. This hadn‚Äôt paid enough for two, and Roy had pushed off and got a job as a garage mechanic somewhere near Paris. Shortly after that, a Paris doctor had said the same thing that a London doctor had told Jonathan: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre inclined to anemia. You‚Äôd better have frequent checkups, and it‚Äôs best if you don‚Äôt do any heavy work.‚Äù So from handling armoires and sofas, Jonathan had turned to the lighter work of handling picture frames and glass. Before Jonathan had married Simone, he had told her that he might not live more than another six years, because just at the time he met Simone, he‚Äôd had it confirmed by two doctors that his periodic weakness was caused by myeloid leukemia.

Now, Jonathan thought as he calmly, very calmly began his day, Simone might remarry if he died. Simone worked five afternoons a week from 2:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. at a shoe shop in the Avenue Franklin Roosevelt, which was within walking distance of their house, and this was only in the past year when Georges had been old enough to be put into the French equivalent of kindergarten. He and Simone needed the two hundred francs per week that Simone earned, but Jonathan was irked by the thought that Brezard, her boss, was a bit of a lecher, liked to pinch his employees‚Äô behinds, and doubtless try his luck in the back room where the stock was. Simone was a married woman, as Brezard well knew, so there was a limit as to how far he could go, Jonathan supposed, but that never stopped his type from trying. Simone was not at all a flirt‚Äîshe had a curious shyness, in fact, that suggested that she thought herself not attractive to men. It was a quality that endeared her to Jonathan. In Jonathan‚Äôs opinion, Simone was supercharged with sex appeal, though of the kind that might not be apparent to the average man, and it annoyed Jonathan especially that the cruising swine Brezard must have become aware of Simone‚Äôs very different kind of attractiveness, and that he wanted some of it for himself. Not that Simone talked much about Brezard. Only once had she mentioned that he tried it on with his women employees, who were two besides Simone. For an instant that morning, as Jonathan presented a framed watercolor to a client, he imagined Simone, after a discreet interval, succumbing to the odious Brezard, who after all was a bachelor and financially better off than Jonathan. Absurd, Jonathan thought. Simone hated his type.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs lovely! Excellent!‚Äù said the young woman in a bright-red coat, holding the watercolor at arm‚Äôs length.

Jonathan‚Äôs long, serious face slowly smiled, as if a small and private sun had come out of clouds and begun to shine within him. She was so genuinely pleased! Jonathan didn‚Äôt know her‚Äîin fact, she was picking up the picture that an older woman, perhaps her mother, had brought in. The price should have been twenty francs more than he had first estimated, because the frame was not the same as the older woman had chosen (Jonathan had not had enough in stock), but Jonathan didn‚Äôt mention this and accepted the eighty francs agreed upon.

Then Jonathan pushed a broom over his wooden floor, and feather-dusted the three or four pictures in his small front window. His shop was positively shabby, Jonathan thought that morning. No color anywhere, frames of all sizes leaning against unpainted walls, samples of frame wood hanging from the ceiling, a counter with an order book, ruler, pencils. At the back of the shop stood a long wooden table where Jonathan worked with his miter boxes, saws, and glass cutters. Also on the big table were his carefully protected sheets of mat board, a great roll of brown paper, rolls of string, wire, pots of glue, boxes of variously sized nails, and above the table on the wall were racks of knives and hammers. In principle, Jonathan liked the nineteenth-century atmosphere, the lack of commercial frou-frou. He wanted his shop to look as if a good craftsman ran it, and in that he had succeeded, he thought. He never overcharged, did his work on time, or if he was going to be late, he notified his clients by postcard or a telephone call. People appreciated that, Jonathan had found.

At 11:35 a.m., having framed two small pictures and fixed their owners‚Äô names to them, Jonathan washed his hands and face at the cold water tap in his sink, combed his hair, stood up straight and tried to brace himself for the worst. Dr. Perrier‚Äôs office was not far away in the Rue Grande. Jonathan turned his door card to OUVERT at 14:30, locked his front door, and set out.

Jonathan had to wait in Dr. Perrier‚Äôs front room with its sickly, dusty rose laurel plant. The plant never flowered, it didn‚Äôt die, and never grew, never changed. Jonathan identified himself with the plant. Again and again his eyes were drawn to it, though he tried to think of other things. There were copies of Paris Match on the oval table, out of date and much thumbed, but Jonathan found them more depressing than the laurel plant. Dr. Perrier also worked at the big H√¥pital de Fontainebleau, Jonathan reminded himself, otherwise it would have seemed an absurdity to entrust one‚Äôs life, to believe an opinion of whether one lived or died, to a doctor who worked in such a wretched little place as this looked.

The nurse came out and beckoned.

‚ÄúWell, well, how‚Äôs the interesting patient, my most interesting patient?‚Äù said Dr. Perrier, rubbing his hands, then extending one to Jonathan.

Jonathan shook his hand. ‚ÄúI feel quite all right, thank you. But what is this about‚ÄîI mean the tests of two months ago. I understand they are not so favorable?‚Äù

Dr. Perrier looked blank, and Jonathan watched him intently. Then Dr. Perrier smiled, showing yellowish teeth under his carelessly trimmed mustache.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean unfavorable? You saw the results.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äîyou know I‚Äôm not an expert in understanding them‚Äîperhaps.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I explained them to you‚Äî Now what is the matter? You‚Äôre feeling tired again?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn fact no.‚Äù Since Jonathan knew the doctor wanted to get away for lunch, he said hastily, ‚ÄúTo tell the truth, a friend of mine has learned somewhere that‚ÄîI‚Äôm due for a crisis. Maybe I haven‚Äôt long to live. Naturally, I thought this information must have come from you.‚Äù

Dr. Perrier shook his head, then laughed, hopped about like a bird and came to rest with his skinny arms lightly outspread on the top of a glass-enclosed bookcase. ‚ÄúMy dear sir‚Äîfirst of all, if it were true, I would not have said it to anybody. That is not ethical. Second, it is not true, as far as I know from the last test.‚Äî Do you want another test today? Late this afternoon at the hospital, maybe I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNot necessarily. What I really wanted to know is‚Äîis it true? You wouldn‚Äôt just not tell me?‚Äù Jonathan said with a laugh. ‚ÄúJust to make me feel better?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat nonsense! Do you think I‚Äôm that kind of a doctor?‚Äù

Yes, Jonathan thought, looking Dr. Perrier straight in the eye. And God bless him, maybe, in some cases, but Jonathan thought he deserved the facts, because he was the kind of man who could face the facts. Jonathan bit his underlip. He could go to the lab in Paris, he thought, insist on seeing the specialist Moussu again. Also he might get something out of Simone today at lunchtime.

Dr. Perrier was patting his arm. ‚ÄúYour friend‚Äîand I won‚Äôt ask who he is!‚Äîis either mistaken or not a very nice friend, I think. Now then, you should tell me when and if you become tired, that is what counts . . .‚Äù

Twenty minutes later, Jonathan was climbing the front steps of his house, carrying an apple tart and a long loaf of bread. He let himself in with his key, and walked down the hall to the kitchen. He smelled frying potatoes, a mouthwatering smell always signifying lunch, not dinner, and Simone‚Äôs potatoes would be in long slender pieces, not short chunks like the chips in England. Why had he thought of English chips?

Simone was at the stove, wearing an apron over her dress, wielding a long fork. ‚ÄúHello, Jon. You‚Äôre a little late.‚Äù

Jonathan put an arm around her and kissed her cheek, then held up the paper box, swung it toward Georges who was sitting at the table, blond head bent, cutting out parts for a mobile from an empty box of cornflakes.

‚ÄúAh, a cake! What kind?‚Äù Georges asked.

‚ÄúApple.‚Äù Jonathan set the box on the table.

They had a small steak each, the delicious fried potatoes, a green salad.

‚ÄúBrezard is starting inventory,‚Äù Simone said. ‚ÄúThe summer stock comes in next week, so he wants to have a sale Friday and Saturday. I might be a little late tonight.‚Äù

She had warmed the apple tart on the asbestos plate. Jonathan waited impatiently for Georges to go in the living room where a lot of his toys were, or out to the garden. When Georges left finally Jonathan said:

‚ÄúI had a funny letter today from Alan.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlan? Funny how?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wrote it just before he went to New York. It seems he‚Äôs heard‚Äî‚Äù Should he show her Alan‚Äôs letter? She could read English well enough. Jonathan decided to go on. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs heard somewhere that I‚Äôm worse, due for a bad crisis‚Äîor something. Do you know anything about it?‚Äù Jonathan watched her eyes.

Simone looked genuinely surprised. ‚ÄúWhy no, Jon. How would I hear‚Äîexcept from you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI spoke with Dr. Perrier just now. That‚Äôs why I was a bit late. Perrier says he doesn‚Äôt know of any change in the situation, but you know Perrier!‚Äù Jonathan smiled, still watching Simone anxiously. ‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs the letter,‚Äù he said, pulling it from his back pocket. He translated the paragraph.

‚ÄúMon dieu!‚Äî Well, where did he hear it from?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs the question. I‚Äôll write him and ask. Don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù Jonathan smiled again, a more genuine smile. He was sure Simone didn‚Äôt know anything about it.

Jonathan carried a second cup of coffee into the small square living room where Georges was now sprawled on the floor with his cutouts. Jonathan sat down at the writing desk, which always made him feel like a giant. It was a rather dainty French √©critoire, a present from Simone‚Äôs family. Jonathan was careful not to put too much weight on the writing shelf. He addressed an air letter to Alan McNear at the Hotel New Yorker, began the letter breezily enough, and wrote a second paragraph:

I don‚Äôt know quite what you mean in your letter about the news (about me) which shocked you. I feel all right, but this morning spoke with my doctor here to see if he was giving me the whole story. He disclaims any knowledge of a worse condition. So dear Alan, what does interest me is where did you hear it? Could you possibly drop me a line soon? It sounds like a misunderstanding. I‚Äôd be delighted to forget it, but I hope you can understand my curiosity as to where you heard it.

He dropped the letter in a yellow box en route to his shop. It would probably be a week before he heard from Alan.

That afternoon, Jonathan‚Äôs hand was as steady as ever as he pulled his razor knife down the edge of his steel ruler. He thought of his letter, making its progress to Orly airport, maybe by this evening, maybe by tomorrow morning. He thought of his age, thirty-four, and of how pitifully little he would have done if he were to die in another couple of months. He‚Äôd produced a son, and that was something, but hardly an achievement worthy of special praise. He would not leave Simone very secure. If anything, he had lowered her standard of living slightly. Her father was only a coal merchant, but somehow over the years her family had gathered a few conveniences of life around them, a car for instance, decent furniture. They vacationed in June or July down south in a villa which they rented, and last year they had paid a month‚Äôs rent so that Jonathan and Simone could go there with Georges. Jonathan had not done as well as his brother Philip, two years older than himself, though Philip had looked physically weaker, had been a dull, plodding type all his life. Now Philip was a professor of anthropology at Bristol University, not brilliant, Jonathan was sure, but a good solid man with a solid career, a wife and two children. Jonathan‚Äôs mother, a widow now, had a happy existence with her brother and sister-in-law in Oxfordshire, taking care of the big garden there and doing all the shopping and cooking. Jonathan felt himself the failure of his family, both physically and as to his work. He had first wanted to be an actor. At eighteen he‚Äôd gone to a drama school for two years. He‚Äôd not a bad face for an actor, he thought, not too handsome with a big nose and wide mouth, yet good-looking enough to play romantic roles, and at the same time heavy enough to play heavier roles in time. What pipe dreams! He‚Äôd hardly got two walk-on parts in the three years he‚Äôd hung around London and Manchester theaters‚Äîalways supporting himself, of course, by odd jobs, including one as a veterinary‚Äôs assistant. ‚ÄúYou take up a lot of space and you‚Äôre not even sure of yourself,‚Äù a director once said to him. And then, working for an antique dealer in another of his odd jobs, Jonathan had thought he might like the antique business. He had learned all he could from his boss, Andrew Mott. Then the grand move to France with his chum Roy Johnson, who had also had enthusiasm, if not much knowledge, for starting an antique shop via the junk trade. Jonathan remembered his dreams of glory and adventure in a new country, France, dreams of freedom, of success. And instead of success, instead of a series of educational mistresses, instead of making friends with the bohemians, or with some stratum of French society which Jonathan had imagined existed but perhaps didn‚Äôt‚Äîinstead of all this Jonathan had continued to limp along, no better off really than when he‚Äôd been trying to get jobs as an actor and had supported himself any old way.

The only successful thing in his whole life was his marriage to Simone, Jonathan thought. The news of his disease had come in the same month he had met Simone Foussadier. He‚Äôd begun to feel strangely weak and had romantically thought that it might be due to falling in love. But a little extra rest hadn‚Äôt shaken the weakness, he had fainted once in a street of Nemours, so he had gone to a doctor‚ÄîDr. Perrier in Fontainebleau, who had suspected a blood condition and sent him to a Dr. Moussu in Paris. The specialist Moussu, after two days of tests, had confirmed myeloid leukemia, and said that he might have from six to eight, with luck twelve years to live. There would be an enlargement of the spleen, which in fact Jonathan already had without having noticed it. Thus Jonathan‚Äôs proposal to Simone had been a declaration of love and death in the same awkward speech. It would have been enough to put most young women off, or to have made them say they needed time to think about it. Simone had said yes, she loved him too. ‚ÄúIt is the love that is important, not the time,‚Äù Simone had said. None of the calculations that Jonathan had associated with the French, and with Latins in general. Simone said she had already spoken to her family. And this after they had known each other only two weeks. Jonathan felt himself suddenly in a world more secure than any he had ever known. Love, in a real and not a merely romantic sense, love that he had no control over, had miraculously rescued him. In a way, he felt that it had rescued him from death, but he realized that he meant that love had taken the terror out of death. And here was death six years later, as Dr. Moussu in Paris had predicted. Perhaps. Jonathan didn‚Äôt know what to believe.

He must make another visit to Moussu in Paris, he thought. Three years ago, Jonathan had had a complete change of blood under Dr. Moussu‚Äôs supervision in a Paris hospital. The treatment was called Vincainestine, the idea or the hope being that the excess of white with accompanying yellow components would not return to the blood. But the yellow excess had reappeared in about eight months.

Before he made an appointment with Dr. Moussu, however, Jonathan preferred to wait for a letter from Alan McNear. Alan would write at once, Jonathan felt sure. One could count on Alan.

Jonathan, before he left his shop, cast one desperate glance around its Dickensian interior. It wasn‚Äôt really dusty, it was just that the walls needed repainting. He wondered if he should make an effort to spruce the place up, start soaking his customers as so many picture framers did, sell lacquered brass items with big markups? Jonathan winced. He wasn‚Äôt the type.

That day was Wednesday. On Friday, while bending over a stubborn screw eye that had been in an oak frame for perhaps a hundred and fifty years and had no intention of yielding to his pliers, Jonathan had suddenly to drop the pliers and look for a seat. The seat was a wooden box against a wall. He got up almost at once and wet his face at the sink, bending as low as he could. In five minutes or so, the faintness passed, and by lunchtime he had forgotten about it. Such moments came every two or three months, and Jonathan was glad if they didn‚Äôt catch him on the street.

On Tuesday, six days after he had posted his letter to Alan, he received a letter from the Hotel New Yorker.

Sat. March 25

Dear Jon:

Believe me, I‚Äôm glad you spoke with your doctor and that the news is good! The person who told me you were in a serious way was a little balding fellow with mustache and a glassy eye, early forties maybe. He seemed really concerned, and perhaps you shouldn‚Äôt hold it too much against him, as he may have heard it from someone else.

I‚Äôm enjoying this town and wish you and Simone were here, esp. as I‚Äôm on an expense account . . .

The man Alan meant was Pierre Gauthier, who had an art supply shop in the Rue Grande. He was not a friend of Jonathan‚Äôs, just an acquaintance. Gauthier often sent people to Jonathan to have their pictures framed. Gauthier had been at the house the night of Alan‚Äôs send-off party, Jonathan remembered distinctly, and must have spoken to Alan then. It was out of the question that Gauthier had spoken maliciously. Jonathan was only a little surprised that Gauthier even knew he had a blood ailment, though the word did get around, Jonathan realized. Jonathan thought the thing to do was speak to Gauthier and ask him where he‚Äôd heard the story.

It was 8:50 a.m. Jonathan had waited for the post, as he had yesterday morning also. His impulse was to go straight to Gauthier‚Äôs, but he felt this would show unseemly anxiety, and that he‚Äôd better get his bearings by going to his shop and opening as usual.

Because of three or four customers, Jonathan hadn‚Äôt a break till 10:25 a.m. He left his clock card in the glass of his door indicating that he would be open again at 11 a.m.

When Jonathan entered the art supply shop, Gauthier was busy with two women customers. Jonathan pretended to browse among racks of paintbrushes until Gauthier was free. Then he said:

‚ÄúM. Gauthier! How goes it?‚Äù Jonathan extended a hand.

Gauthier clasped Jonathan‚Äôs hand in both his own and smiled. ‚ÄúAnd you, my friend?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell enough, thank you. . . . Ecoutez. I don‚Äôt want to take your time‚Äîbut there is something I would like to ask you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

Jonathan beckoned Gauthier farther away from the door which might open at any minute. There was not much standing room in the little shop. ‚ÄúI heard from a friend‚Äîmy friend Alan, you remember? The Englishman. At the party at my house a few weeks ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Your friend the Englishman. Alain.‚Äù Gauthier remembered and looked attentive.

Jonathan tried to avoid even glancing at Gauthier‚Äôs false eye, but to concentrate on the other eye. ‚ÄúWell, it seems you told Alan that you‚Äôd heard I was very ill, maybe not going to live much longer.‚Äù

Gauthier‚Äôs soft face grew solemn. He nodded. ‚ÄúYes, m‚Äôsieur, I did hear that. I hope it‚Äôs not true. I remember Alain, because you introduced him to me as your best friend. So I assumed he knew. Perhaps I should have said nothing. I am sorry, it was perhaps tactless. I thought you were‚Äîin the English style‚Äîputting on a brave face.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing serious, M. Gauthier, because as far as I know, it‚Äôs not true! I‚Äôve just spoken with my doctor. But‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, bon! Ah well, that‚Äôs different! I‚Äôm delighted to hear that, M. Trevanny! Ha! Ha!‚Äù Pierre Gauthier gave a clap of laughter as if a ghost had been laid, and he found not only Jonathan but himself back among the living.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôd like to know where you heard this. Who told you I was ill?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh‚Äîyes!‚Äù Gauthier pressed a finger to his lips, thinking. ‚ÄúWho? A man. Yes‚Äîof course!‚Äù He had it, but he paused.

Jonathan waited.

‚ÄúBut I remember he said he wasn‚Äôt sure. He‚Äôd heard it, he said. An incurable blood disease, he said.‚Äù

Jonathan felt warm with anxiety again, as he had felt several times in the past week. He wet his lips. ‚ÄúBut who? How did he hear it? Didn‚Äôt he say?‚Äù

Gauthier again hesitated. ‚ÄúSince it isn‚Äôt true‚Äîshouldn‚Äôt we best forget it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone you know very well?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! Not at all well, I assure you.‚Äù

‚ÄúA customer.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Yes, he is. A nice man, a gentleman. But since he said he wasn‚Äôt sure.‚Äî Really, m‚Äôsieur, you shouldn‚Äôt bear a resentment, although I can understand how you could resent such a remark.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich leads to the interesting question how did the gentleman come to hear I was very ill,‚Äù Jonathan went on, laughing now.

‚ÄúYes. Exactly. Well, the point is, it isn‚Äôt true. Isn‚Äôt that the main thing?‚Äù

Jonathan saw in Gauthier a French politeness, and unwillingness to alienate a customer, and‚Äîwhich was to be expected‚Äîan aversion to the subject of death. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. That‚Äôs the main thing.‚Äù Jonathan shook hands with Gauthier, both of them smiling now, and bade him adieu.

That very day at lunch, Simone asked Jonathan if he had heard from Alan. Jonathan said yes.

‚ÄúIt was Gauthier who said something to Alan.‚Äù

‚ÄúGauthier? The art shop man?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Jonathan was lighting a cigarette over his coffee. Georges had gone out into the garden. ‚ÄúI went to see Gauthier this morning and I asked him where he‚Äôd heard it. He said from a customer. A man.‚Äî Funny, isn‚Äôt it? Gauthier wouldn‚Äôt tell me who, and I can‚Äôt really blame him. It‚Äôs some mistake, of course. Gauthier realizes that.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a shocking thing,‚Äù said Simone.

Jonathan smiled, knowing Simone wasn‚Äôt really shocked, since she knew Dr. Perrier had given him rather good news. ‚ÄúAs we say in English, one must not make a mountain out of a molehill.‚Äù

In the following week, Jonathan bumped into Dr. Perrier in the Rue Grande, the doctor in a hurry to enter the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale before it shut at twelve sharp. But he paused to ask how Jonathan was.

‚ÄúQuite well, thank you,‚Äù said Jonathan, whose mind was on buying a plunger for the toilet from a shop a hundred yards away which also shut at noon.

‚ÄúM. Trevanny‚Äî‚Äù Dr. Perrier paused with one hand on the big knob of the bank‚Äôs door. He moved away from the door, closer to Jonathan. ‚ÄúIn regard to what we were talking about the other day‚Äîno doctor can be sure, you know. In a situation like yours. I didn‚Äôt want you to think I‚Äôd given you a guarantee of perfect health, immunity for years. You know yourself‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt assume that!‚Äù Jonathan interrupted.

‚ÄúThen you understand,‚Äù said Dr. Perrier, smiling, and dashed at once into his bank.

Jonathan trotted on in quest of the plunger. It was the kitchen sink stopped up, not the toilet, he remembered, and Simone had lent a neighbor their plunger months ago and‚ÄîJonathan was thinking of what Dr. Perrier had said. Did he know something, suspect something from the last test, something not sufficiently definite to warrant telling him about?

At the door of the droguerie, Jonathan encountered a smiling, dark-haired girl who was just locking up, removing the outside door handle.

‚ÄúI am sorry. It is five minutes past twelve,‚Äù she said.

Tom, during the last week in March, was engaged in painting a full-length portrait of Heloise horizontal on the yellow satin sofa. And Heloise seldom agreed to pose. But the sofa stayed still, and Tom had it satisfactorily on his canvas. He had also made seven or eight sketches of Heloise with her head propped upon her left hand, her right hand resting on a big art book. He kept the two best sketches and threw the others away.

Reeves Minot had written him one letter, asking Tom if he had come up with a helpful idea‚Äîas to a person, Reeves meant. The letter had arrived a couple of days after Tom had spoken with Gauthier, from whom Tom usually bought his paints. Tom had replied to Reeves: ‚ÄúAm trying to think, but meanwhile you should go ahead with your own ideas, if you have any.‚Äù The ‚Äúam trying to think‚Äù was merely polite, even false, like a lot of phrases that served to oil the machinery of social intercourse, as Emily Post might say. Reeves hardly kept Belle Ombre oiled financially, in fact Reeves‚Äôs payments to Tom for occasional services as go-between and fence would hardly cover the dry-cleaning bills, but it never hurt to maintain friendly relations. Reeves had procured a false passport for Tom and had got it to Paris fast when Tom had needed it to help defend the Derwatt industry. Tom might one day need Reeves again.

But the business with Jonathan Trevanny was merely a game for Tom. He was not doing it for Reeves‚Äôs gambling interests. Tom happened to dislike gambling, and had no respect for people who chose to earn their living, or even part of their living from it. It was pimping, of a sort. Tom had started the Trevanny game out of curiosity, and because Trevanny had once sneered at him‚Äîand because Tom wanted to see if his own wild shot would find its mark, and make Jonathan Trevanny, who Tom sensed was priggish and self-righteous, uneasy for a time. Then Reeves could offer his bait, hammering the point of course that Trevanny was soon to die anyway. Tom doubted that Trevanny would bite, but it would be a period of discomfort for Trevanny, certainly. Unfortunately Tom couldn‚Äôt guess how soon the rumor would get to Jonathan Trevanny‚Äôs ears. Gauthier was gossipy enough, but it just might happen, even if Gauthier told two or three people, that no one would have the courage to broach the subject to Trevanny himself.

So Tom, although busy as usual with his painting, his spring planting, his German and French studies (Schiller and Moli√®re now), plus supervising a crew of three masons who were constructing a greenhouse along the right side of Belle Ombre‚Äôs back lawn, still counted the passing days and imagined what might have happened after that afternoon in the middle of March, when he had said to Gauthier that he‚Äôd heard Trevanny wasn‚Äôt long for this world. Not too likely that Gauthier would speak to Trevanny directly, unless they were closer than Tom thought. Gauthier would more likely tell someone else about it. Tom counted on the fact (he was sure it was a fact) that the possibility of anyone‚Äôs imminent death was a fascinating subject to everyone.

Tom went to Fontainebleau, some twelve miles from Villeperce, every two weeks or so. Fontainebleau was better than Moret for shopping, for having suede coats cleaned, for buying radio batteries and the rarer things that Mme. Annette wished for her cuisine. Jonathan Trevanny had a telephone in his shop, Tom had noted in the directory, but apparently not in his house in the Rue St. Merry. Tom had been trying to look up the house number, but he thought he would recognize the house when he saw it. Around the end of March, Tom became curious to see Trevanny again, from a distance, of course, and so on a trip to Fontainebleau one Friday morning, a market day, for the purpose of buying two round terra-cotta flower tubs, Tom, after putting these items in the back of the Renault station wagon, walked through the Rue des Sablons, where Trevanny‚Äôs shop was. It was nearly noon.

Trevanny‚Äôs shop looked in need of paint and a bit depressing, as if it belonged to an old man, Tom thought. Tom had never patronized Trevanny, because there was a good framer in Moret, closer to Tom. The little shop with ‚ÄúEncadrement‚Äù in fading red letters on the wood over the door stood in a row of shops‚Äîa launderette, a cobbler‚Äôs, a modest travel agency‚Äîwith its door on the left side and to the right a square window with assorted frames and two or three paintings with handwritten price tags on them. Tom crossed the street casually, glanced into the shop and saw Trevanny‚Äôs tall, Nordic-looking figure behind the counter some twenty feet away. Trevanny was showing a man a length of frame, slapping it into his palm, talking. Then Trevanny glanced at the window, saw Tom for an instant, but continued talking to the customer with no change in his expression.

Tom strolled on. Trevanny hadn‚Äôt recognized him, Tom felt. Tom turned right, into the Rue de France, the next more important street after the Rue Grande, and continued till he came to the Rue St. Merry where he turned right. Or had Trevanny‚Äôs house been to the left? No, right.

Yes, there it was, surely, the narrow, cramped-looking gray house with slender black handrails going up the front steps. The tiny areas on either side of the steps were cemented, and no flowerpots relieved the barrenness. But there was a garden behind, Tom recalled. The windows, though sparkling clean, showed rather limp curtains. Yes, this was where he‚Äôd come on the invitation of Gauthier that evening in February. There was a narrow passage on the left side of the house which must lead to the garden beyond. A green plastic garbage bin stood in front of the padlocked iron gate to the garden, and Tom imagined that the Trevannys usually got to the garden via the back door off the kitchen, which Tom remembered.

Tom was on the other side of the street, walking slowly, but careful not to appear to be loitering, because he could not be sure that the wife, or someone, was not even now looking out one of the windows.

Was there anything else he needed to buy? Zinc white. He was nearly out of it. And that purchase would take him to Gauthier the art supply man. Tom quickened his step, congratulating himself because his need of zinc white was a real need, so he‚Äôd be entering Gauthier‚Äôs on a real errand, while at the same time he might be able to satisfy his curiosity.

Gauthier was alone in the shop.

‚ÄúBonjour, M. Gauthier!‚Äù said Tom.

‚ÄúBonjour, M. Reepley!‚Äù Gauthier replied, smiling. ‚ÄúAnd how are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well, thank you, and you?‚Äî I find I need some zinc white.‚Äù

‚ÄúZinc white.‚Äù Gauthier pulled a flat drawer from his cabinet against a wall. ‚ÄúHere they are. And you like the Rembrandt, as I recall.‚Äù

Tom did. Derwatt zinc white and other Derwatt-made colors were available, too, their tubes emblazoned with the bold, downward slanting signature of Derwatt in black on the label, but somehow Tom did not want to paint at home with the name Derwatt catching his eye every time he reached for a tube of anything. Tom paid, and as Gauthier was handing him his change and the little bag with the zinc white in it, Gauthier said:

‚ÄúAh, M. Reepley, you recall M. Trevanny, the framer of the Rue St. Merry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù said Tom who had been wondering how to bring Trevanny up.

‚ÄúWell, the rumor that you heard, that he is going to die soon, is not true at all.‚Äù Gauthier smiled.

‚ÄúNo? Well, very good! I‚Äôm glad to hear that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. M. Trevanny went to see his doctor even. I think he was a bit upset. Who wouldn‚Äôt be, eh? Ha-ha!‚Äî But you said somebody told you, M. Reepley?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. A man who was at the party‚Äîin February. Mme. Trevanny‚Äôs birthday party. So I assumed it was a fact and everybody knew it, you see.‚Äù

Gauthier looked thoughtful.

‚ÄúYou spoke to M. Trevanny?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äîno. But I did speak to his best friend one evening, another evening at the Trevannys‚Äô house, this month. Evidently he spoke to M. Trevanny. How these things get around!‚Äù

‚ÄúHis best friend?‚Äù Tom asked with an air of innocence.

‚ÄúAn Englishman. Alain something. He was going to America next day. But‚Äîdo you recall who told you, M. Reepley?‚Äù

Tom shook his head slowly. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt recall his name and not even how he looked. There were so many people that night.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause‚Äî‚Äù Gauthier bent closer and whispered, as if there were someone else present. ‚ÄúM. Trevanny asked me, you see, who had told me, and of course I didn‚Äôt say it was you. These things can be misinterpreted. I didn‚Äôt want to get you into trouble. Ha!‚Äù Gauthier‚Äôs shiny glass eye did not laugh but looked out from his head with a bold stare, as if there were a different brain from Gauthier‚Äôs behind that eye, a computer kind of brain that at once could know everything, if someone just set the programming.

‚ÄúI thank you for that, because it is not nice to make remarks which are not true about people‚Äôs health, eh?‚Äù Tom was grinning now, ready to take his leave, but he added, ‚ÄúM. Trevanny does have a blood condition, however, didn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is true. I think it‚Äôs leukemia. But that is something he lives with. He once told me he‚Äôd had it for years.‚Äù

Tom nodded. ‚ÄúAt any rate, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not in danger. A bient√¥t, M. Gauthier. Many thanks.‚Äù

Tom walked in the direction of his car. Trevanny‚Äôs shock, though it may have lasted just a few hours until he consulted his doctor, must at least have put a little crack in his self-confidence. A few people had believed, and maybe Trevanny himself had believed, that he was not going to live more than a few weeks. That was because such a possibility wasn‚Äôt out of the question for a man with Trevanny‚Äôs ailment. A pity Trevanny was now reassured, but that little crack might be all that Reeves needed. The game could now enter its second stage. Trevanny would probably say no to Reeves. End of game, in that case. On the other hand Reeves would approach him as if of course he was a doomed man. It would be amusing if Trevanny weakened. That day after lunch with Heloise and her Paris friend No√´lle, who was going to stay overnight, Tom left the ladies and wrote a letter to Reeves on his typewriter.

March 28, 19‚Äî‚Äî

Dear Reeves:

I have an idea for you, in case you have not yet found what you are looking for. His name is Jonathan Trevanny, early thirties, English, a picture framer, married to Frenchwoman with small son. [Here Tom gave Trevanny‚Äôs home and shop addresses and shop telephone number.] He looks as if he could use some money, and although he may not be the type you want, he looks the picture of decency and innocence, and what is more important for you, he has only a few more months or weeks to live, I have found out. He‚Äôs got leukemia, and has just heard the bad news. He might be willing to take on a dangerous job to earn some money now.

I don‚Äôt know Trevanny personally, and need I emphasize that I don‚Äôt wish to make his acquaintance, nor do I wish you to mention my name. My suggestion is, if you want to sound him out, come to F‚Äôbleau, put yourself up at a charming hostelry called the H√¥tel de l‚ÄôAigle Noir for a couple of days, contact Trevanny by ringing his shop, make an appointment, and talk it over. And do I have to tell you to give another name besides your own?

Tom felt a sudden optimism about the project. The vision of Reeves with his disarming air of uncertainty and anxiety‚Äîalmost suggestive of probity‚Äîlaying such an idea before Trevanny who looked as upright as a saint, made Tom laugh. Did he dare occupy another table in the H√¥tel de l‚ÄôAigle Noir‚Äôs dining room or bar when Reeves made his date with Trevanny? No, that would be too much. This reminded Tom of another point, and he added to his letter:

If you come to F‚Äôbleau, please don‚Äôt telephone or write a note to me under any circumstances. Destroy my letter here, please.

Yours ever,

Tom

The telephone rang in Jonathan‚Äôs shop on Friday afternoon 31 March. He was just then gluing brown paper to the back of a large picture, and he had to find suitable weights‚Äîan old sandstone saying LONDON, the glue pot itself, a wooden mallet‚Äîbefore he could lift the telephone.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúBonjour, m‚Äôsieur. M. Trevanny? . . . You speak English, I think. My name is Stephen Wister, W-i-s-t-e-r. I‚Äôm in Fontainebleau for a couple of days, and I wonder if you could find a few minutes to talk with me about something‚Äîsomething that I think would interest you.‚Äù

The man had an American accent. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy pictures,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a framer.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to see you about anything connected with your work. It‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt explain over the phone.‚Äî I‚Äôm staying at the Aigle Noir.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was wondering if you have a few minutes this evening after you close your shop. Around seven? Six-thirty? We could have a drink or a coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚ÄîI‚Äôd like to know why you want to see me.‚Äù A woman had come into the shop‚ÄîMme. Tissot, Tissaud?‚Äîto pick up a picture. Jonathan smiled apologetically to her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to explain when I see you,‚Äù said the soft, earnest voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take only ten minutes. Have you any time at seven today, for instance?‚Äù

Jonathan shifted. ‚ÄúSix-thirty would be all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you in the lobby. I‚Äôm wearing a gray plaid suit. But I‚Äôll speak to the porter. It won‚Äôt be difficult.‚Äù

Jonathan usually closed around 6:30 p.m. At 6:15 p.m., he stood at his cold-water sink, scrubbing his hands. It was a mild day and Jonathan had worn a polo-neck sweater with an old beige corduroy jacket, not elegant enough for l‚ÄôAigle Noir, and the addition of his second-best mac would have made things worse. Why should he care? The man wanted to sell him something. It couldn‚Äôt be anything else.

The hotel was only a five-minute walk from the shop. It had a small front court enclosed by high iron gates, and a few steps led up to its front door. Jonathan saw a slender, tense-looking man with crew-cut hair move toward him with a faint uncertainty, and Jonathan said:

‚ÄúMr. Wister?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Reeves gave a twitch of a smile and extended his hand. ‚ÄúShall we have a drink in the bar here, or do you prefer somewhere else?‚Äù

The bar here was pleasant and quiet. Jonathan shrugged. ‚ÄúAs you like.‚Äù He noticed an awful scar the length of Wister‚Äôs cheek.

They went to the wide door of the hotel‚Äôs bar, which was empty except for one man and woman at a small table. Wister turned away as if put off by the quietude, and said:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try somewhere else.‚Äù

They walked out of the hotel and turned right. Jonathan knew the next bar, the Caf√© du Sport or some such, roistering at this hour with boys at the pinball machines and workmen at the counter, and on the threshold of the bar-caf√© Wister stopped as if he had come unexpectedly upon a battlefield in action.

‚ÄúWould you mind,‚Äù Wister said, turning away, ‚Äúcoming up to my room? It‚Äôs quiet and we can have something sent up.‚Äù

They went back to the hotel, climbed one flight of stairs, and entered an attractive room in Spanish d√©cor‚Äîblack ironwork, a raspberry-colored bedspread, a pale-green carpet. A suitcase on the rack was the only sign of the room‚Äôs occupancy. Wister had entered without a key.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll you have?‚Äù Wister went to the telephone. ‚ÄúScotch?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

The man ordered in clumsy French. He asked for the bottle to be brought up, and for plenty of ice, please.

Then there was a silence. Why was the man uneasy, Jonathan wondered. Jonathan stood by the window where he had been looking out. Evidently Wister didn‚Äôt want to talk until the drinks arrived. Jonathan heard a discreet tap at the door.

A white-jacketed waiter came in with a tray and a friendly smile. Stephen Wister poured generous drinks.

‚ÄúAre you interested in making some money?‚Äù

Jonathan smiled, settled in a comfortable armchair now, with the huge iced scotch in his hand. ‚ÄúWho isn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a dangerous job in mind‚Äîwell, an important job‚Äîfor which I‚Äôm prepared to pay quite well.‚Äù

Jonathan thought of drugs: the man probably wanted something delivered, or held. ‚ÄúWhat business are you in?‚Äù Jonathan inquired politely.

‚ÄúSeveral. Just now one you might call‚Äîgambling.‚Äî Do you gamble?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Jonathan smiled.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt either. That‚Äôs not the point.‚Äù The man got up from the side of the bed and walked slowly about the room. ‚ÄúI live in Hamburg.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúGambling isn‚Äôt legal in city limits, but it goes on in private clubs. However, that‚Äôs not the point, whether it‚Äôs legal or not. I need one person eliminated, possibly two, and possibly a theft‚Äîto be done. Now that‚Äôs putting my cards on the table.‚Äù He looked at Jonathan with a serious, hopeful expression.

Killed, the man meant. Jonathan was startled, then he smiled and shook his head. ‚ÄúI wonder where you got my name!‚Äù

Stephen Wister didn‚Äôt smile. ‚ÄúNever mind that.‚Äù He continued walking up and down with his drink in his hand, and his gray eyes glanced at Jonathan and away again. ‚ÄúI wonder if you‚Äôre interested in ninety-six thousand dollars? That‚Äôs forty thousand pounds, and about four hundred and eighty thousand francs‚Äînew francs. Just for shooting only one man, maybe two, we‚Äôll have to see how it goes. It‚Äôll be an arrangement that‚Äôs safe and foolproof for you.‚Äù

Jonathan shook his head again. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where you heard that I‚Äôm a‚Äîa gunman. You‚Äôve got me confused with someone else.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not at all.‚Äù

Jonathan‚Äôs smile faded under the man‚Äôs intense stare. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mistake. . . . Do you mind telling me how you came to ring me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre‚Äî‚Äù Wister looked more pained than ever. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to live more than a few weeks. You know that. You‚Äôve got a wife and a small son‚Äîhaven‚Äôt you? Wouldn‚Äôt you like to leave them a little something when you‚Äôre gone?‚Äù

Jonathan felt the blood drain from his face. How did Wister know so much? Then he realized it was all connected, that whoever told Gauthier he was going to die soon knew this man, was connected with him somehow. Jonathan was not going to mention Gauthier. Gauthier was an honest man, and Wister was a crook. Suddenly Jonathan‚Äôs scotch did not taste so good. ‚ÄúThere was a crazy rumor‚Äîrecently‚Äî‚Äù

Now Wister shook his head. ‚ÄúIt is not a crazy rumor. It may be that your doctor hasn‚Äôt told you the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you know more than my doctor? My doctor doesn‚Äôt lie to me. It‚Äôs true I have a blood disease, but‚ÄîI‚Äôm in no worse a state now‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan broke off. ‚ÄúThe essential thing is, I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt help you, Mr. Wister.‚Äù

As Wister bit on his underlip, the long scar moved in a distasteful way, like a live worm.

Jonathan looked away from him. Was Dr. Perrier lying after all? Jonathan thought he should ring up the Paris laboratory tomorrow morning and ask some questions, or simply go to Paris and demand another explanation.

‚ÄúMr. Trevanny, I‚Äôm sorry to say it‚Äôs you who aren‚Äôt informed, evidently. At least you‚Äôve heard what you call the rumor, so I‚Äôm not the bearer of bad tidings. It‚Äôs a matter of your own free choice, but under the circumstances, a considerable sum like this, I would think, sounds rather pleasant. You could stop working and enjoy your‚Äî Well, for instance, you could take a cruise around the world with your family and still leave your wife . . .‚Äù

Jonathan felt slightly faint, and stood up and took a deep breath. The sensation passed, but he preferred to be on his feet. Wister was talking, but Jonathan barely listened.

‚Äú. . . my idea. There‚Äôre a few men in Hamburg who would contribute toward the ninety-six thousand dollars. The man or men we want out of the way are Mafia men.‚Äù

Jonathan had only half recovered. ‚ÄúThanks, I am not a killer. You may as well get off the subject.‚Äù

Wister went on. ‚ÄúBut exactly what we want is someone not connected with any of us, or with Hamburg. Although the first man, only a button man, must be shot in Hamburg. The reason is, we want the police to think that two Mafia gangs are fighting each other in Hamburg. In fact, we want the police to step in on our side.‚Äù He continued to walk up and down, looking at the floor mostly. ‚ÄúThe first man ought to be shot in a crowd, a U-bahn crowd. That‚Äôs our subway, underground you‚Äôd call it. The gun would be dropped at once, the‚Äîthe assassin blends into the crowd and vanishes. An Italian gun, with no fingerprints on it. No clues.‚Äù He brought his hands down like a conductor finishing.

Jonathan moved back to the chair, in need of it for a few seconds. ‚ÄúSorry. No.‚Äù He would walk to the door, as soon as he got his strength back.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here all tomorrow, and probably till late Sunday afternoon. I wish you‚Äôd think about it.‚Äî Another scotch? Might do you good.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thanks.‚Äù Jonathan hauled himself up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be pushing off.‚Äù

Wister nodded, looking disappointed.

‚ÄúAnd thanks for the drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù Wister opened the door for Jonathan.

Jonathan went out. He had expected Wister to press a card with his name and address into his hand. Jonathan was glad he hadn‚Äôt.

The streetlights had come on in the Rue de France. 7:22 p.m. Had Simone asked him to buy anything? Bread, perhaps. Jonathan went into a boulangerie and bought a long stick. The familiar chore was comforting.

The supper consisted of a vegetable soup, a couple of slices of leftover fromage de t√™te, a salad of tomatoes and onions. Simone talked about a wallpaper sale at a shop near where she worked. For a hundred francs, they could paper the bedroom, and she had seen a beautiful mauve and green pattern, very light and art nouveau.

‚ÄúWith only one window that bedroom‚Äôs very dark, you know, Jon.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds fine,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúEspecially if it‚Äôs a sale.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a sale. Not one of these silly sales where they reduce something five percent‚Äîlike my stingy boss.‚Äù She wiped breadcrust in her salad oil and popped it into her mouth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried about something? Something happened today?‚Äù

Jonathan smiled suddenly. He wasn‚Äôt worried about anything. He was glad Simone hadn‚Äôt noticed he was a little late, and that he‚Äôd had a big drink. ‚ÄúNo, darling. Nothing happened. The end of the week, maybe. Almost the end.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou feel tired?‚Äù

It was like a question from a doctor, routine now. ‚ÄúNo. . . . I‚Äôve got to telephone a customer tonight between eight and nine.‚Äù It was 8:37 p.m. ‚ÄúI may as well do it now, my dear. Maybe I‚Äôll have some coffee later.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I go with you?‚Äù Georges asked, dropping his fork, sitting back ready to leap out of his chair.

‚ÄúNot tonight, mon petit vieux. I‚Äôm in a hurry. And you just want to play the pinball machines, I know you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHollywood Chewing Gum!‚Äù Georges shouted, pronouncing it in the French manner: ‚ÄúOllyvoo Schvang Gom!‚Äù

Jonathan winced as he lifted his jacket from the hall hook. Hollywood Chewing Gum, whose green and white wrappers littered the gutters and occasionally Jonathan‚Äôs garden, had mysterious attractions for infants of the French nation. ‚ÄúOui, m‚Äôsieur,‚Äù Jonathan said, and went out the door.

Dr. Perrier had a home number in the directory, and Jonathan hoped he was in tonight. A certain tabac, which had a telephone, was closer than Jonathan‚Äôs shop. A panic was taking hold of Jonathan, and he began to trot toward the slanted lighted red cylinder that marked the tabac two streets away. He would insist on the truth. Jonathan nodded a greeting to the young man behind the bar, whom he knew slightly, and pointed to the telephone and also to the shelf where the directories lay. ‚ÄúFontainebleau!‚Äù Jonathan shouted. The place was noisy, with a jukebox going besides. Jonathan searched out the number and dialed.

Dr. Perrier answered, and recognized Jonathan‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúI would like very much to have another test. Even tonight. Now‚Äîif you could take a sample.‚Äù

‚ÄúTonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could come to see you at once. In five minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you‚Äî You are weak?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚ÄîI thought if the test went to Paris tomorrow‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan knew that Dr. Perrier was in the habit of sending various samples to Paris on Saturday mornings. ‚ÄúIf you could take a sample either tonight or early tomorrow morning‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not in my office tomorrow morning. I have visits to make. If you are so upset, M. Trevanny, come to my house now.‚Äù

Jonathan paid for his call, and remembered just before he went out the door to buy two packages of Hollywood Chewing Gum, which he dropped into his jacket pocket. Perrier lived way over on the Boulevard Maginot, which would take nearly ten minutes. Jonathan trotted and walked. He had never been to the doctor‚Äôs home.

It was a big, gloomy building, and the conci√®rge was an old, slow, skinny woman watching television in a little glass-enclosed room full of plastic plants. While Jonathan waited for the lift to descend into the rickety cage, the conci√®rge crept into the hall and asked curiously:

‚ÄúYour wife is having a baby, m‚Äôsieur?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No,‚Äù Jonathan said, smiling, and recalled that Dr. Perrier was a general practitioner.

He rode up.

‚ÄúNow what is the matter?‚Äù Dr. Perrier asked, beckoning him through a dining room. ‚ÄúCome into this room.‚Äù

The house was dimly lighted. The television set was on somewhere. The room they went into was like a little office, with medical books on the shelves, and a desk on which the doctor‚Äôs black bag now sat.

‚ÄúMon dieu, one would think you are on the brink of collapse and you‚Äôve just been running, obviously, and your cheeks are pink. Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve heard another rumor that you‚Äôre on the edge of the grave!‚Äù

Jonathan made an effort to sound calm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that I want to be sure. I don‚Äôt feel so splendid, to tell the truth. I know it‚Äôs been only two months since the last test but‚Äîsince the next is due the end of April, what‚Äôs the harm‚Äî‚Äù He broke off, shrugging. ‚ÄúSince it‚Äôs easy to take some marrow, and since it can go off tomorrow early‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan was aware that his French was clumsy at that moment, aware of the word moelle, marrow, which had become revolting, especially when Jonathan thought of his as being abnormally yellow. He sensed Dr. Perrier‚Äôs attitude that he must humor his patient.

‚ÄúYes, I can take the sample. The result will probably be the same as last time. You can never have complete assurance from the medical men, M. Trevanny . . .‚Äù The doctor continued to talk, while Jonathan removed his sweater, obeyed Dr. Perrier‚Äôs gesture and lay down on an old leather sofa. The doctor jabbed the anesthetizing needle in. ‚ÄúBut I can appreciate your anxiety,‚Äù Dr. Perrier said seconds later, pressing and tapping on the tube that was going into Jonathan‚Äôs sternum.

Jonathan disliked the crunching sound of it, but found the slight pain quite bearable. This time, perhaps, he‚Äôd learn something. Jonathan could not refrain from saying, before he left, ‚ÄúI must know the truth, Dr. Perrier. You don‚Äôt think, really, that the laboratory might not be giving us a proper summing up? I‚Äôm ready to believe their figures are correct‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThis summing up or prediction is what you can‚Äôt get, my dear young man!‚Äù

Jonathan then walked home. He had thought of telling Simone that he‚Äôd gone to see Perrier, that he again felt anxious, but Jonathan couldn‚Äôt: he‚Äôd put Simone through enough. What could she say, if he told her? She would only become a little more anxious herself, like him.

Georges was already in bed upstairs, and Simone was reading to him. Ast√©rix again. Georges, propped against his pillows, and Simone on a low stool under the lamplight, were like a tableau vivant of domesticity, and the year might have been 1880, Jonathan thought, except for Simone‚Äôs slacks. Georges‚Äô hair was as yellow as cornsilk under the light.

‚ÄúLe schvang gom?‚Äù Georges asked, grinning.

Jonathan smiled and produced one packet. The other could wait for another occasion.

‚ÄúYou were a long time,‚Äù said Simone.

‚ÄúI had a beer at the caf√©,‚Äù Jonathan said.

The next afternoon between 4:30 and 5 p.m., as Dr. Perrier had told him to do, Jonathan telephoned the Ebberle-Valent Laboratoires in Neuilly. He gave his name and spelled it and said he was a patient of Dr. Perrier‚Äôs in Fontainebleau. Then he waited to be connected with the right department, while the telephone gave a blup every minute for the pay units. Jonathan had pen and paper ready. Could he spell his name again, please? Then a woman‚Äôs voice began to read the report, and Jonathan jotted figures down quickly. Hyperleucocytose 190,000. Wasn‚Äôt that bigger than before?

‚ÄúWe shall of course send a written report to your doctor which he should receive by Tuesday.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis report is less favorable than the last, is it not?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have not the previous report here, m‚Äôsieur.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there a doctor there? Could I speak with a doctor, perhaps?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am a doctor, m‚Äôsieur.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Then this report‚Äîwhether you have the old one or not there, is not a good one, is it?‚Äù

Like a textbook, she said, ‚ÄúThis is a potentially dangerous condition involving lowered resistance . . .‚Äù

Jonathan had telephoned from his shop. He had turned his sign to FERME and drawn his door curtain, though he had been visible through the window, and now as he went to remove the sign, he realized he hadn‚Äôt locked his door. Since no one else was due to call for a picture that afternoon, Jonathan thought he could afford to close. It was 4:55 p.m.

He walked to Dr. Perrier‚Äôs office, prepared to wait more than an hour if he had to. Saturday was a busy day, because most people didn‚Äôt work and were free to see the doctor. There were three people ahead of Jonathan, but the nurse spoke to him and asked if he would be long, Jonathan said no, and the nurse squeezed him in with an apology to the next patient. Had Dr. Perrier spoken to his nurse about him, Jonathan wondered?

Dr. Perrier raised his black eyebrows at Jonathan‚Äôs scribbled notes, and said, ‚ÄúBut this is incomplete.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but it tells something, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs slightly worse‚Äîisn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne would think you want to get worse!‚Äù Dr. Perrier said with his customary cheer, which now Jonathan mistrusted. ‚ÄúFrankly, yes, it is worse, but only a little worse. It is not crucial.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn percentage‚Äîten percent worse, would you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúM. Trevanny‚Äîyou are not an automobile! Now it is not reasonable for me to make a remark until I get the full report on Tuesday.‚Äù

Jonathan walked homeward rather slowly, walked through the Rue des Sablons just in case he saw someone who wanted to go into his shop. There wasn‚Äôt anyone. Only the launderette was doing a brisk business, and people with bundles of laundry were bumping into each other at the door. It was nearly 6 p.m. Simone would be quitting the shoe shop sometime after 7 p.m., later than usual, because her boss Brezard wanted to take in every franc possible before closing for Sunday and Monday. And Wister was still at l‚ÄôAigle Noir. Was he waiting only for him, waiting for him to change his mind and say yes? Wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if Dr. Perrier was in conspiracy with Stephen Wister, if between them they might have fixed the Ebberle-Valent Laboratoires to give him a bad report? And if Gauthier were in on it, too, the little messenger of bad tidings? Like a nightmare in which the strangest elements join forces against‚Äîagainst the dreamer. But Jonathan knew he was not dreaming. He knew that Dr. Perrier was not in the pay of Stephen Wister. Nor was Ebberle-Valent. And it was not a dream that his condition was worse, that death was a little closer, or sooner, than he had thought. True of everyone, however, who lived one more day, Jonathan reminded himself. Jonathan thought of death, and the process of aging, as a decline, literally a downward path. Most people had a chance to take it slowly, starting at fifty-five or whenever they slowed up, descending until seventy or whatever year was their number. Jonathan realized that his death was going to be like falling over a cliff. When he tried to ‚Äúprepare‚Äù himself, his mind wavered and dodged. His attitude, or his spirit, was still thirty-four years old and wanted to live.

The Trevannys‚Äô narrow house, blue-gray in the dusk, showed no lights. It was a rather somber house, and that fact had amused Jonathan and Simone when they had bought it five years ago. ‚ÄúThe Sherlock Holmes house,‚Äù Jonathan had used to call it, when they were debating this house versus another in Fontainebleau. ‚ÄúI still prefer the Sherlock Holmes house,‚Äù Jonathan remembered saying once. The house had an 1890 air, suggestive of gaslights and polished banisters, though none of the wood anywhere in the house had been polished when they had moved in. The house had looked as if it could be made into something with turn-of-the-century charm, however. The rooms were smallish but interestingly arranged, the garden a rectangular patch full of wildly overgrown rosebushes, but at least the rosebushes had been there, and all the garden had needed was a clearing out. And the scalloped glass portico over the back steps, its little glass-enclosed porch, had made Jonathan think of Vuillard, and Bonnard. But now it struck Jonathan that five years of their occupancy hadn‚Äôt really defeated the gloom. New wallpaper would brighten the bedroom, yes, but that was only one room. The house wasn‚Äôt yet paid for: they had three more years to go on the mortgage. An apartment, such as they‚Äôd had in Fontainebleau in the first year of their marriage, would have been cheaper, but Simone was used to a house with a bit of garden‚Äîshe‚Äôd had a garden all her life in Nemours‚Äîand as an Englishman, Jonathan liked a bit of garden too. Jonathan never regretted that the house took such a hunk of their income.

What Jonathan was thinking, as he climbed the front steps, was not so much of the remaining mortgage, but the fact that he was probably going to die in this house. More than likely, he would never know another, more cheerful house with Simone. He was thinking that the Sherlock Holmes house had been standing for decades before he had been born, and that it would stand for decades after his death. It had been his fate to choose this house, he felt. One day they would carry him out feet first, maybe still alive but dying, and he would never enter the house again.

To Jonathan‚Äôs surprise, Simone was in the kitchen, playing some kind of card game with Georges at the table. She looked up, smiling, then Jonathan saw her remember: he was to have rung the Paris laboratory this afternoon. But she couldn‚Äôt mention that in front of Georges.

‚ÄúThe old creep closed early today,‚Äù Simone said. ‚ÄúNo business.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood!‚Äù Jonathan said brightly. ‚ÄúWhat goes on in this gambling den?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm winning!‚Äù Georges said in French.

Simone got up and followed Jonathan into the hall as he hung his raincoat. She looked at him inquiringly.

‚ÄúNothing to worry about,‚Äù Jonathan said, but she beckoned him farther down the hall to the living room. ‚ÄúIt seems to be a trifle worse, but I don‚Äôt feel worse, so what the hell? I‚Äôm sick of it. Let‚Äôs have a Cinzano.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were worried because of that story, weren‚Äôt you, Jon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. That‚Äôs true.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I knew who started that.‚Äù Her eyes narrowed bitterly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nasty story. Gauthier never told you who said it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. As Gauthier said, it was some mistake somewhere, some kind of exaggeration.‚Äù Jonathan was repeating what he had said to Simone before. But he knew it was no mistake, that it was a story quite calculated.





5


Jonathan stood at the first-floor bedroom window, watching Simone hang the wash on the garden line. There were pillowcases, Georges‚Äô sleep suits, a dozen pairs of Georges‚Äô and Jonathan‚Äôs socks. Two white nightdresses, bras, Jonathan‚Äôs beige work trousers‚Äîeverything except sheets, which Simone sent to the laundry, because well-ironed sheets were important to her. Simone wore tweed slacks and a thin red sweater that clung to her body. Her back looked strong and supple as she bent over the big oval basket, pegging out dishcloths now. It was a fine, sunny day with a hint of summer in the breeze.

Jonathan had wriggled out of going to Nemours to have lunch with Simone‚Äôs parents, the Foussadiers. He and Simone went every other Sunday as a rule. Unless Simone‚Äôs brother G√©rard fetched them, they took the bus to Nemours. Then at the Foussadiers‚Äô home, they had a big lunch with G√©rard and his wife and two children, who also lived in Nemours. Simone‚Äôs parents always made a fuss over Georges, always had a present for him. Around 3 p.m., Simone‚Äôs father, Jean-No√´l, would turn on the TV. Jonathan was frequently bored, but he went with Simone because it was the correct thing to do, and because he respected the closeness of French families.

‚ÄúDo you feel all right?‚Äù Simone had asked, when Jonathan had begged out.

‚ÄúYes, darling. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm not in the mood today, and I‚Äôd also like to get that patch ready for the tomatoes. So why don‚Äôt you go with Georges?‚Äù

So Simone and Georges went on the bus at noon. Simone had put the remains of a b≈ìuf bourguignon into a small red casserole on the stove, so all Jonathan had to do was heat it when he felt hungry.

Jonathan had wanted to be alone. He was thinking about the mysterious Stephen Wister and his proposal. Not that Jonathan meant to telephone Wister today at l‚ÄôAigle Noir, though Jonathan was very much aware that Wister was still there, not three hundred yards away. He had no intention of getting in touch with Wister, though the idea was curiously exciting and disturbing, a bolt from the blue, a shaft of color in his uneventful existence, and Jonathan wanted to observe it, to enjoy it in a sense. Jonathan also had the feeling (it had been proven quite often) that Simone could read his thoughts, or at least knew when something was preoccupying him. If he appeared absent-minded that Sunday, he didn‚Äôt want Simone to notice it and ask him what was the matter. So Jonathan gardened with a will, and daydreamed. He thought of forty thousand pounds, a sum which meant the mortgage paid off at once, a couple of hire-purchase items paid off, the interior of their house painted where it needed to be painted, a television set, a nest egg put aside for Georges‚Äô university, a few new clothes for Simone and himself‚Äîah, mental ease! Simply freedom from anxiety! He thought of one, maybe two Mafia figures‚Äîburly, dark-haired thugs exploding in death, arms flailing, their bodies falling. What Jonathan was incapable of imagining, as his spade sank into the earth of his garden, was himself pulling a trigger, having aimed a gun at a man‚Äôs back, perhaps. More interesting, more mysterious, more dangerous, was how Wister had got hold of his name. There was a plot against him in Fontainebleau, and it had somehow got to Hamburg. Impossible that Wister had him mixed up with someone else, because even Wister had spoken of his illness, of his wife and small son. Someone, Jonathan thought, whom he considered a friend or at least a friendly acquaintance, was not friendly at all toward him.

Wister would probably leave Fontainebleau around 5 p.m. today, Jonathan thought. By 3 p.m., Jonathan had eaten his lunch, tidied up papers and old receipts in the catchall drawer of the round table in the center of the living room. Then‚Äîhe was happily aware that he was not tired at all‚Äîhe tackled with broom and dustpan the exterior of the pipes and the floor around their mazout furnace.

A little after 5 p.m., as Jonathan was scrubbing soot from his hands at the kitchen sink, Simone arrived with Georges and her brother G√©rard and his wife, Yvonne, and they all had a drink in the kitchen. Georges had been presented by his grandparents with a round box of Easter goodies including an egg wrapped in gold foil, a chocolate rabbit, colored gumdrops, all under yellow cellophane and as yet unopened, because Simone forbade him to open it, in view of the other sweets he had eaten in Nemours. Georges went with the Foussadier children into the garden.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt step on the soft part, Georges!‚Äù Jonathan shouted. He had raked the turned ground smooth, but left the pebbles for Georges to pick up. Georges would probably get his two chums to help him fill the red wagon. Jonathan gave him fifty centimes for a wagonful of pebbles‚Äînot ever full, but full enough to cover the bottom.

It was starting to rain. Jonathan had taken the laundry in a few minutes ago.

‚ÄúThe garden looks marvelous!‚Äù Simone said. ‚ÄúLook, G√©rard!‚Äù She beckoned her brother on to the little back porch.

By now, Jonathan thought, Wister was probably on a train from Fontainebleau to Paris, or maybe he‚Äôd take a taxi from Fontaine-bleau to Orly, considering the money he seemed to have. Maybe he was already in the air, en route to Hamburg. Simone‚Äôs presence, the voices of G√©rard and Yvonne, seemed to erase Wister from the H√¥tel de l‚ÄôAigle Noir, at any rate, seemed to turn Wister almost into a quirk of Jonathan‚Äôs imagination. Jonathan felt also a mild triumph in the fact that he had not telephoned Wister, as if by not telephoning him he had successfully resisted some kind of temptation.

G√©rard Foussadier, an electrician, was a neat, serious man a little older than Simone, with fairer hair than hers, and a carefully clipped brown mustache. His hobby was naval history, and he made model nineteenth-century and eighteenth-century frigates in which he installed miniature electric lights that he could put completely or partially on by a switch in his living room. G√©rard himself laughed at the anachronism of electric lights in his frigates, but the effect was beautiful when all the other lights in the house were turned out, and eight or ten ships seemed to be sailing on a dark sea around the living room.

‚ÄúSimone said you were a little worried‚Äîas to your health, Jon,‚Äù G√©rard said earnestly. ‚ÄúI am sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot particularly. Just another checkup,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúThe report‚Äôs about the same.‚Äù Jonathan was used to these clich√©s, which were like saying, ‚ÄúVery well, thank you,‚Äù when someone asked you how you felt. What Jonathan said seemed to satisfy G√©rard, so evidently Simone had not said much.

Yvonne and Simone were talking about linoleum. The kitchen linoleum was wearing out in front of the stove and the sink. It hadn‚Äôt been new when they bought the house.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really feeling all right, darling?‚Äù Simone asked Jonathan, when the Foussadiers had left.

‚ÄúBetter than all right. I even attacked the boiler room. The soot.‚Äù Jonathan smiled.

‚ÄúYou are mad.‚Äî Tonight you‚Äôll have a decent dinner at least. Mama insisted that I bring home three paupiettes from lunch and they‚Äôre delicious!‚Äù

Then close to 11 p.m., as they were about to go to bed, Jonathan felt a sudden depression, as if his legs, his whole body had sunk into something viscous‚Äîas if he were walking hip-deep in mud. Was he simply tired? But it seemed more mental than physical. He was glad when the light was turned out, when he could relax with his arms around Simone, her arms around him, as they always lay when they fell asleep. He thought of Stephen Wister (or was that his real name?) maybe flying eastward now, his thin figure stretched out in an airplane seat. Jonathan imagined Wister‚Äôs face with the pinkish scar, puzzled, tense, but Wister would no longer be thinking of Jonathan Trevanny. He‚Äôd be thinking of someone else. He must have two or three more prospects, Jonathan thought.

The morning was chill and foggy. Just after 8 a.m., Simone went off with Georges to the Ecole Maternelle, and Jonathan stood in the kitchen, warming his fingers on a second bowl of caf√© au lait. The heating system wasn‚Äôt adequate. They‚Äôd got rather uncomfortably through another winter, and even now in spring the house was chilly in the mornings. The furnace had been in the house when they bought it, adequate for the five radiators downstairs but not for the other five upstairs, which they had installed hopefully. They‚Äôd been warned, Jonathan remembered, but a bigger furnace would have cost three thousand new francs, and they hadn‚Äôt had the money.

Three letters had fallen through the slot in the front door. One was an electricity bill. Jonathan turned a square white envelope over and saw H√¥tel de l‚ÄôAigle Noir on its back. He opened the envelope. A business card fell out and dropped. Jonathan picked it up and read ‚ÄúStephen Wister chez,‚Äù which had been written above:

Reeves Minot

159 Agnesstrasse

Winterhude (Alster)

Hamburg 56

629‚Äì6757

There was a letter also.

1 Apr. 19‚Äî‚Äî

Dear Mr. TrFevanny:

I was sorry not to hear from you this morning or so far this afternoon. But in case you change your mind, I enclose a card with my address in Hamburg. If you have second thoughts about my proposition, please telephone me collect at any hour. Or come to talk to me in Hamburg. Your round-trip transportation can be wired to you at once when I hear from you.

In fact, wouldn‚Äôt it be a good idea to see a Hamburg specialist about your blood condition and get another opinion? This might make you feel more comfortable.

I am returning to Hamburg Sunday night.

Yours sincerely,

Stephen Wister

Jonathan was surprised, amused, annoyed all at once. More comfortable. That was a bit funny, since Wister was sure he was going to die soon. If a Hamburg specialist said, ‚ÄúAch, ja, you have just one or two more months,‚Äù would that make him feel more comfortable? Jonathan pushed the letter and the card into a back pocket of his trousers. A return trip to Hamburg gratis. Wister was thinking of every enticement. Interesting that he‚Äôd sent the letter Saturday afternoon, so he would receive it early Monday, though Jonathan might have rung him at any time Sunday. But there was no collection from postboxes in town on Sunday.

It was 8:52 a.m. Jonathan thought of what he had to do. He needed more mat paper from a firm in Melun. There were at least two clients he should write a postcard to, because their pictures had been ready for more than a week. Jonathan usually went to his shop on Mondays, and spent his time doing odds and ends, though the shop was not open, as it was against French law to be open six days a week.

Jonathan got to his shop at 9:15 a.m., drew the green shade of his door, and locked the door again, leaving the FERME sign in it. He pottered about, thinking still about Hamburg. The opinion of a German specialist might be a good thing. Two years ago Jonathan had consulted a specialist in London. His report had been the same as the French, which had satisfied Jonathan that the diagnoses were true. Mightn‚Äôt the Germans be a little more thorough or up to date? Suppose he accepted Wister‚Äôs offer of a round-trip? (Jonathan was copying an address onto a postcard.) But then he‚Äôd be beholden to Wister. Jonathan realized he was toying with the idea of killing someone for Wister‚Äînot for Wister, but for the money. A Mafia member. They were all criminals themselves, weren‚Äôt they? Of course, Jonathan reminded himself, he could always pay Wister back, if he accepted his round-trip fare. The point was, Jonathan couldn‚Äôt pull the money out of the bank funds just now, there wasn‚Äôt enough. If he really wanted to make sure of his condition, Germany (or Switzerland for that matter) could tell him. They still had the best doctors in the world, hadn‚Äôt they? Jonathan was now putting the card of the paper supplier of Melun beside his telephone to remind him to ring tomorrow, because the paper place wasn‚Äôt open today either. And who knew, mightn‚Äôt Stephen Wister‚Äôs proposal be feasible? For an instant, Jonathan saw himself blown to bits by the crossfire of German police officers: they‚Äôd caught him just after he fired on the Italian. But even if he were dead, Simone and Georges would get the forty thousand quid. Jonathan came back to reality. He wasn‚Äôt going to kill anybody, no. But Hamburg, going to Hamburg seemed a lark, a break, even if he learned some awful news there. He‚Äôd learn facts, anyway. And if Wister paid now, Jonathan could pay him back in a matter of three months, if he scrimped, didn‚Äôt buy any clothes, not even a beer in a caf√©. Jonathan rather dreaded telling Simone, though she‚Äôd agree, of course, since it had to do with seeing another doctor, presumably an excellent doctor. The scrimping would come out of Jonathan‚Äôs own pocket.

Around 11 a.m., Jonathan put in a call to Wister‚Äôs number in Hamburg, direct, not collect. Three or four minutes later, his telephone rang, and Jonathan had a clear connection, much better than Paris usually sounded.

‚Äú. . . Yes, this is Wister,‚Äù Wister said in his light, tense voice.

‚ÄúI had your letter this morning,‚Äù Jonathan began. ‚ÄúThe idea of going to Hamburg‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, why not?‚Äù said Wister casually.

‚ÄúBut I mean the idea of seeing a specialist‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll cable you the money right away. You can pick it up at the Fontainebleau post office. It should be there in a couple of hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Äîthat‚Äôs kind of you. Once I‚Äôm there, I can‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you come today? This evening? There‚Äôs room here for you to stay.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about today.‚Äù And yet, why not?

‚ÄúCall me again when you‚Äôve got your ticket. Tell me what time you‚Äôre coming in. I‚Äôll be in all day.‚Äù

Jonathan‚Äôs heart was beating a little fast when he hung up.

At home during lunchtime, Jonathan went upstairs to the bedroom to see if his suitcase was handy. It was, on top of the wardrobe where it had been since their last holiday, nearly a year ago, in Arles.

He said to Simone, ‚ÄúDarling, something important. I‚Äôve decided to go to Hamburg and see a specialist.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes?‚Äî Perrier suggested it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Äîin fact, no. My idea. I wouldn‚Äôt mind having a German doctor‚Äôs opinion. I know it‚Äôs an expense.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Jon! Expense!‚Äî Did you have any news this morning? But the laboratory report comes tomorrow, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. What they say is always the same, darling. I want a fresh opinion.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen do you want to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúSoon. This week.‚Äù

Just before 5 p.m. Jonathan called at the Fontainebleau post office. The money had arrived. Jonathan presented his carte d‚Äôidentit√© and received six hundred francs. He went from the post office to the Syndicat d‚ÄôInitiatives in the Place Franklin Roosevelt, just a couple of streets away, and bought a round-trip ticket to Hamburg on a plane that left Orly airport at 9:25 p.m. that evening. He would have to hurry, he realized, and he liked that, because it precluded thinking, hesitating. He went to his shop and telephoned Hamburg, this time collect.

Wister again answered. ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs fine. At eleven-fifty-five, right. Take the airport bus to the city terminus, would you? I‚Äôll meet you there.‚Äù

Then Jonathan made one telephone call to a client who had an important picture to pick up, to say that he would be closed Tuesday and Wednesday for ‚Äúreasons of family,‚Äù a common excuse. He‚Äôd have to leave a sign to that effect in his door for a couple of days. Not a very important matter, Jonathan thought, since shopkeepers in town frequently closed for a few days for one reason or another. Jonathan had once seen a sign saying ‚Äúclosed due to hangover.‚Äù

Jonathan shut up shop and went home to pack. It would be a two-day stay at most, he thought, unless the Hamburg hospital or whatever insisted that he stay longer for tests. He had checked the trains to Paris, and there was one around 7 p.m. that would do nicely. He had to get to Paris, then to Les Invalides for a bus to Orly. When Simone came home with Georges, Jonathan had his suitcase downstairs.

‚ÄúTonight?‚Äù Simone said.

‚ÄúThe sooner the better, darling. I had an impulse. I‚Äôll be back Wednesday, maybe even tomorrow night.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äîwhere can I reach you? You arranged for a hotel?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôll have to telegraph you, darling. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got everything arranged with the doctor? Who is the doctor?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet. I‚Äôve only heard of the hospital.‚Äù Jonathan dropped his passport, trying to stick it into the inside pocket of his jacket.

‚ÄúI never saw you like this,‚Äù said Simone.

Jonathan smiled at her. ‚ÄúAt least‚Äîobviously I‚Äôm not collapsing!‚Äù

Simone wanted to go with him to the Fontainebleau-Avon station, and take the bus back, but Jonathan begged her not to.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll telegraph right away,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúWhere is Hamburg?‚Äù Georges demanded for the second time.

‚ÄúAllemagne!‚Äî Germany!‚Äù Jonathan said.

Jonathan found a taxi in the Rue de France, luckily. The train was pulling into the Fontainebleau-Avon station as he arrived, and he barely had time to buy his ticket and hop on. Then it was a taxi from the Gare de Lyon to Les Invalides. Jonathan had some money left over from the six hundred francs. For a while, he was not going to worry about money.

On the plane, he half slept, with a magazine in his lap. He was imagining being another person. The rush of the plane seemed to be rushing this new person away from the man left behind in the dark gray house in the Rue St. Merry. He imagined another Jonathan helping Simone with the dishes at this moment, chatting about boring things such as the price of linoleum for the kitchen floor.

The plane touched down. The air was sharp and much colder. There was a long lighted motorway, then the city‚Äôs streets, massive buildings looming up into the night sky, streetlights of different color and shape from those of France.

And there was Wister smiling, walking toward him with his right hand extended. ‚ÄúWelcome, Mr. Trevanny! Had a good trip? . . . My car is just outside. Hope you didn‚Äôt mind coming to the terminus. My driver‚Äînot my driver but one I use sometimes‚Äîhe was tied up till just a few minutes ago.‚Äù

They were walking out to the curb. Wister droned on in his American accent. Except for his scar, nothing about Wister suggested violence. He was, Jonathan decided, too calm, which from a psychiatric point of view might be ominous. Or was he merely nursing an ulcer? Wister stopped beside a well-polished black Mercedes-Benz. An older man, wearing no cap, took care of Jonathan‚Äôs medium-sized suitcase, and held the door for him and Wister.

‚ÄúThis is Karl,‚Äù Wister said.

‚ÄúEvening,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Karl smiled, and murmured something in German.

It was quite a long drive. Wister pointed out the Rathaus, ‚Äúthe oldest in all Europe, and the bombs didn‚Äôt get it,‚Äù and a great church or cathedral whose name Jonathan didn‚Äôt get. He and Wister were sitting together in the back. They entered a part of the town with a more countrylike atmosphere, went over still another bridge, and on to a darker road.

‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù Wister said. ‚ÄúMy place.‚Äù

The car had turned into a climbing driveway and stopped beside a large house with a few lighted windows and a lighted, well-kept entrance.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an old house with four flats, and I have one,‚Äù Wister explained. ‚ÄúLots of such houses in Hamburg. Converted. Here I have a nice view of the Alster. It‚Äôs the Aussen Alster, the big one. You‚Äôll see more tomorrow.‚Äù

They rode up in a modern lift, Karl taking Jonathan‚Äôs suitcase. Karl pressed a bell, and a middle-aged woman in a black dress and white apron opened the door, smiling.

‚ÄúThis is Gaby,‚Äù said Wister to Jonathan. ‚ÄúMy part-time housekeeper. She works for another family in the house and sleeps with them, but I told her we might want some food tonight. Gaby, Herr Trevanny aus Frankreich.‚Äù

The woman greeted Jonathan pleasantly, and took his coat. She had a round, pudding-like face, and looked the soul of goodwill.

‚ÄúWash in here, if you like,‚Äù said Wister, gesturing to a bathroom whose light was already on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you a scotch. Are you hungry?‚Äù

When Jonathan came out of the bathroom, the lights‚Äîfour lamps‚Äîwere on in the big square living room. Wister was sitting on a green sofa, smoking a cigar. Two scotches stood on the coffee table in front of Wister. Gaby came in at once with a tray of sandwiches and a round, pale-yellow cheese.

‚ÄúAh, thank you, Gaby.‚Äù Wister said to Jonathan, ‚ÄúLate for Gaby, but when I told her I had a guest coming, she insisted on staying on to serve the sandwiches.‚Äù Wister, though making a cheerful remark, still didn‚Äôt smile. In fact his straight eyebrows drew together anxiously as Gaby arranged the plates and the silverware. When she departed, he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre feeling all right? Now the main thing is‚Äîthe visit to the specialist. I have a good man in mind, Dr. Heinrich Wentzel, a hematologist at the Eppendorfer Krankenhaus, which is the main hospital here. World famous. I‚Äôve made an appointment for you for tomorrow at two, if that‚Äôs agreeable.‚Äù

‚ÄúCertainly. Thank you,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúThat gives you a chance to catch up on your sleep. Your wife didn‚Äôt mind too much, I hope, your taking off on such short notice? . . . After all it‚Äôs only intelligent to consult more than one doctor about a serious ailment . . .‚Äù

Jonathan was only half listening. He felt dazed, and he was also a bit distracted by the d√©cor, by the fact it was all supposed to be German, and that it was the first time he‚Äôd been in Germany. The furnishings were quite conventional and more modern than antique, though there was a handsome Biedermeier desk against the wall opposite Jonathan. There were low bookshelves along all the walls, long green curtains at the windows, and the lamps in corners spread the light pleasantly. A purple wooden box lay open on the glass coffee table, presenting a variety of cigars and cigarettes in compartments. The white fireplace had brass accessories, but there was no fire now. A rather interesting painting which looked like a Derwatt hung over the fireplace. And where was Reeves Minot? Wister was Minot, Jonathan supposed. Was Wister going to announce this or assume that Jonathan realized it? It occurred to Jonathan that he and Simone ought to paint or paper their whole house white. He should discourage the idea of the art nouveau wallpaper in the bedroom. If they wanted to achieve more light, white was the logical‚Äî

‚Äú. . . You might‚Äôve given some thought to the other proposition,‚Äù Wister was saying in his soft voice. ‚ÄúThe idea I was talking about in Fontainebleau.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I haven‚Äôt changed my mind about that,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúAnd so this leads to‚Äîobviously I owe you six hundred francs.‚Äù Jonathan forced a smile. Already he felt the scotch, and as soon as he realized this, he nervously drank a little more from his glass. ‚ÄúI can repay you within three months. The specialist is the essential thing for me now.‚Äî First things first.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù said Wister. ‚ÄúAnd you mustn‚Äôt think about any repayment. That‚Äôs absurd.‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt want to argue, but he felt vaguely ashamed. More than anything, Jonathan felt odd, as if he were dreaming, or somehow not himself. It‚Äôs only the foreignness of everything, he thought.

‚ÄúThis Italian we want eliminated,‚Äù Wister said, folding his hands behind his head and looking up at the ceiling, ‚Äúhas a routine job.‚Äî Ha! That‚Äôs funny! He only pretends it‚Äôs a job with regular hours. He‚Äôs hanging around the clubs off the Reeperbahn, pretending he has a taste for gambling, and he‚Äôs pretending he has a job as an enologist, and I‚Äôm sure he has a chum at the‚Äîwhatever they call the wine factory here. He goes to the wine factory every afternoon, but he spends his evenings in one or another of the private clubs, playing the tables a little and seeing who he can meet. Mornings he sleeps, because he‚Äôs up all night. Now the point is,‚Äù Wister said, sitting up, ‚Äúhe takes the U-bahn every afternoon to get home, home being a rented flat. He‚Äôs got a six-months lease and a real six-month job with the wine place to make it look legitimate.‚Äî Have a sandwich!‚Äù Wister extended the plate, as if he had just realized the sandwiches were there.

Jonathan took a tongue sandwich. There were also coleslaw and dill pickle.

‚ÄúThe important point is he gets off the U-bahn at the Steinstrasse station every day around six-fifteen by himself, looking like any other businessman coming back from the office. That‚Äôs the time we want to get him.‚Äù Wister spread his bony hands palm downward. ‚ÄúThe assassin fires once if you can get the middle of his back, twice for sure maybe, drops the gun and‚Äî Bob‚Äôs your uncle as the English say, isn‚Äôt that right?‚Äù

The phrase was indeed familiar, out of the long ago past. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs so easy, why do you need me?‚Äù Jonathan managed a polite smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an amateur to say the least. I‚Äôd botch it.‚Äù

Wister might not have heard. ‚ÄúThe crowd in the U-bahn may be rounded up. Some of them. Who can tell? Thirty, forty people maybe, if the cops get there fast enough. It‚Äôs a huge station, the station for the main railway terminus. They might look people over. But suppose they look you over?‚Äù Wister shrugged. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have dropped the gun. You‚Äôll have used a thin stocking over your hand, and you‚Äôll drop the stocking a few seconds after you fire. No powder marks on you, no fingerprints on the gun. You have no connection with the man who‚Äôs dead. Oh, it really won‚Äôt come to all that. But one look at your French identity card, the fact of your appointment with Dr. Wentzel, you‚Äôre in the clear. My point is, our point, we don‚Äôt want anyone connected with us or the clubs . . .‚Äù

Jonathan listened and made no comment. On the day of the shooting, he was thinking, he would have to be in a hotel, he could hardly be a houseguest of Wister, in case a policeman asked him where he was staying. And what about Karl and the housekeeper? Did they know anything about this? Were they trustworthy? It‚Äôs all a lot of nonsense, Jonathan thought, and wanted to smile, but he wasn‚Äôt smiling.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired,‚Äù Wister informed him. ‚ÄúWant to see your room? Gaby already took your suitcase in.‚Äù

Fifteen minutes later, Jonathan was in pajamas after a hot shower. His room had a window at the front of the house, like the living room which had two windows on the front, and Jonathan looked out on a surface of water where there were lights along the near shore, and some red and green lights of tied-up boats. It looked dark, peaceful, and spacious. A searchlight‚Äôs beam swept protectively across the sky. His bed was a three-quarter width, neatly turned down. There was a glass of what looked like water on his bed table and a package of Gitane ma√Øs, his brand, and an ashtray and matches. Jonathan took a sip from the glass and found that it was indeed water.





6


Jonathan sat on the edge of his bed, sipping coffee which Gaby had just brought. It was coffee the way he liked it, strong with a dash of thick cream. Jonathan had awakened at 7 a.m., then gone back to sleep until Wister had knocked on the door at 10:30 a.m.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt apologize, I‚Äôm glad you slept,‚Äù said Wister. ‚ÄúGaby is ready to bring you some coffee. Or do you prefer tea?‚Äù

Wister had also added that he had made a reservation for Jonathan at the Hotel‚ÄîVictoria was its name in English, anyway, where they would go before lunch. Jonathan thanked him. No further conversation about the hotel. But that was the beginning, Jonathan thought, as he had thought last night. If he were to carry out Wister‚Äôs plan, he mustn‚Äôt be a houseguest here. Jonathan, however, felt glad he was going to be out from under Wister‚Äôs roof in a couple of hours.

A friend or acquaintance of Wister‚Äôs named Rudolf something arrived at noon. Rudolf was young and slender with straight black hair, nervous and polite. Wister said he was a medical student. Evidently he did not speak English. He reminded Jonathan of photographs of Franz Kafka. They all got into the car, driven by Karl, and set off for Jonathan‚Äôs hotel. Everything looked so new compared to France, Jonathan thought, and then recalled that Hamburg had been flattened by bombs. The car stopped in a commercial-looking street. It was the Hotel Victoria.

‚ÄúThey all speak English,‚Äù Wister said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wait for you.‚Äù

Jonathan went in. A bellhop had taken his suitcase at the door. He registered, looking at his English passport to get the number right. He asked for his suitcase to be sent up to his room, as Wister had told him to do. The hotel was of middle category, Jonathan saw.

Then they drove to a restaurant for lunch, where Karl did not join them. They had a bottle of wine at their table before the meal, and Rudolf became more merry. Rudolf spoke in German and Wister translated a few of his pleasantries. Jonathan was thinking of the hour 2 p.m., when he was due at the hospital.

‚ÄúReeves‚Äî‚Äù said Rudolf to Wister.

Jonathan thought Rudolf had said it once before, and this time there was no mistake. Wister‚ÄîReeves Minot‚Äîtook it calmly. And so did Jonathan.

‚ÄúAnemic,‚Äù said Rudolf to Jonathan.

‚ÄúWorse.‚Äù Jonathan smiled.

‚ÄúSchlimmer,‚Äù said Reeves Minot, and continued to Rudolf in German, which seemed to Jonathan as clumsy as his French, but was probably equally adequate.

The food was excellent, the portions enormous. Reeves had brought his cigars. But before they could finish the cigars, they had to leave for the hospital.

The hospital was a vast assembly of buildings set among trees and pathways lined with flowers. Karl had again driven them. The wing of the hospital where Jonathan had to go looked like a laboratory of the future‚Äîrooms on either side of a corridor as in a hotel, except that these rooms held chromium chairs or beds and were illuminated by fluorescent or variously colored lamps. There was a smell not of disinfectant but as of some unearthly gas, somewhat resembling the smell Jonathan had known under the X-ray machine which five years ago had done him no good with the leukemia. It was the kind of place where laymen surrendered utterly to the omniscient specialists, Jonathan thought, and at once he felt weak enough to faint. Jonathan was walking at that moment down a seemingly endless corridor of soundproofed floor surface with Rudolf, who was to interpret if Jonathan needed it. Reeves had remained in the car with Karl, but Jonathan was not sure if they were going to wait, or of how long the examination would take.

Dr. Wentzel, a heavy man with gray hair and walrus mustache, knew a little English, but he did not try to construct long sentences. ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù Six years. Jonathan was weighed, asked if he had had any weight loss recently, stripped to the waist, his spleen palpated. All the while, the doctor murmured in German to a nurse who was taking notes. His blood pressure was taken, his eyelids looked at, urine and blood samples taken, finally the sternum marrow sample taken with a punchlike instrument that operated faster and with less discomfort than Dr. Perrier‚Äôs. Jonathan was told he could have the results tomorrow morning. The examination had taken only about forty-five minutes.

Jonathan and Rudolf walked out. The car was several yards away among some other cars in a parking area.

‚ÄúHow was it? . . . When will you know?‚Äù Reeves asked. ‚ÄúWould you like to come back to my place or go to your hotel?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think to my hotel, thanks.‚Äù Jonathan sank with relief into a corner seat of the car.

Rudolf seemed to be singing Wentzel‚Äôs praises to Reeves. They arrived at the hotel.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll pick you up for dinner,‚Äù said Reeves cheerfully. ‚ÄúAt seven.‚Äù

Jonathan got his key and went to his room. He took off his jacket and fell on to the bed facedown. After two or three minutes, he pushed himself up and went to the writing desk. There was notepaper in a drawer. He sat down and wrote:

April 4, 19‚Äî‚Äî

My dear Simone:

I have just had an examination and will know the results tomorrow morning. Very efficient hospital, doctor looking like Emp. Franz Josef, said to be the best hematologist in the world! Whatever the result tomorrow I shall feel more at ease knowing it. With luck I may be home tomorrow before you get this, unless Dr. Wentzel wants to do some other tests.

Will telegraph now, just to say I am all right. I miss you, I think of you and Cailloux.

A bient√¥t with all my love,

Jon

Jonathan hung up his best suit, which was a dark blue, left the rest of his things in his suitcase, and went downstairs to post his letter. He had changed a ten-pound traveler‚Äôs check, from an ancient book of three or four, last evening at the airport. He wrote a short telegram to Simone saying he was all right and that a letter was arriving. Then he went out, took note of the street‚Äôs name and of the look of the neighborhood‚Äîa huge beer advertisement struck him most forcibly‚Äîthen went out for a walk.

The pavements bustled with shoppers and pedestrians, with dachshunds on leads, with hawkers of fruit and newspapers at the corners. Jonathan gazed into a window full of beautiful sweaters. There was also a handsome blue silk dressing gown set off against a background of creamy white sheep pelts. He started to figure out its price in francs and gave it up, not being really interested. He crossed a busy avenue where there were both tramways and buses, came to a canal with a footbridge, and decided not to cross it. A coffee, perhaps. Jonathan approached a pleasant-looking coffee bar which had pastry in the window, a counter as well as small tables inside, and then could not bring himself to go in. He realized that he was terrified of what the report tomorrow morning would say. He had suddenly a hollow feeling with which he was familiar, a feeling of thinness as if he had become tissue paper, a coolness on his forehead as if his life itself were evaporating.

What Jonathan knew also, or at least suspected, was that tomorrow morning he would receive a phony report. Jonathan mistrusted Rudolf‚Äôs presence. A medical student. Rudolf had been no help, because he hadn‚Äôt been needed. The doctor‚Äôs nurse had spoken English. Mightn‚Äôt Rudolf write up a phony report tonight? Substitute it somehow? Jonathan even imagined Rudolf pinching hospital stationery that afternoon. Or maybe he was losing his mind, Jonathan warned himself.

He turned back in the direction of his hotel, taking the shortest way possible. He reached the Victoria, claimed his key, and let himself into his room. Then he took his shoes off, went into the bathroom and wet a towel, and lay down with the towel across his forehead and his eyes. He did not feel sleepy, just somehow odd. Reeves Minot was odd. To advance a total stranger six hundred francs, to make the insane proposal that he had‚Äîpromising more than forty thousand pounds. It couldn‚Äôt be true. Reeves Minot would never deliver. Reeves Minot seemed to live in a world of fantasy. Maybe he wasn‚Äôt even a crook, but merely a bit cracked, a type that lived on delusions of importance and power.

The telephone awakened Jonathan. A man‚Äôs voice said in English:

‚ÄúA chentleman waits on you below, sir.‚Äù

Jonathan looked at his watch and saw that it was a minute or two past 7 p.m. ‚ÄúWould you tell him I‚Äôll be down in two minutes?‚Äù

Jonathan washed his face, put on a polo-neck sweater, then a jacket. He also took his topcoat.

Karl was alone with the car. ‚ÄúYou had a nice afternoon, sir?‚Äù he asked in English.

In the course of the small talk, Jonathan found that Karl had quite a vocabulary in English. How many other strangers had Karl ferried around for Reeves Minot, Jonathan wondered? What business did Karl think Reeves was in? Maybe it simply didn‚Äôt matter to Karl. What business was Reeves supposed to be in?

Karl stopped the car in the sloping driveway again, and this time Jonathan took the lift alone to the second floor.

Reeves Minot, in gray flannels and a sweater, greeted Jonathan at the door. ‚ÄúCome in!‚Äî Did you take it easy this afternoon?‚Äù

They had scotches. A table was set for two, and Jonathan assumed that they were going to be alone this evening.

‚ÄúI would like you to see a picture of this man I have in mind,‚Äù Reeves said, hauling his thin form from the sofa, going to his Biedermeier desk. He took something from a drawer. He had two photographs, one a front view, the other a profile in a group of several people bending over a table.

The table was a roulette table. Jonathan looked at the front-view picture, which was as clear as a passport photograph. The man looked about forty, with the square, fleshy face of lots of Italians, creases already curving from the flanges of his nose down to the level of his thick lips. His dark eyes looked wary, almost startled, yet in the faint smile there was an air also of ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôve I done, eh?‚Äù Salvatore Bianca, Reeves said his name was.

‚ÄúThis picture,‚Äù Reeves said, pointing to the group picture, ‚Äúwas taken in Hamburg about a week ago. He doesn‚Äôt even gamble, just watches. This is a rare moment when he‚Äôs looking at the wheel. . . . Bianca‚Äôs probably killed half a dozen men himself or he wouldn‚Äôt even be a button man. But he‚Äôs not important as a Mafioso. He‚Äôs expendable. Just to start the ball rolling, you see . . .‚Äù Reeves went on, while Jonathan finished his drink, and Reeves made him another. ‚ÄúBianca wears a hat all the time‚Äîoutdoors, that is‚Äîa homburg. A tweed overcoat usually . . .‚Äù

Reeves had a gramophone, and Jonathan would have enjoyed some music, but felt it would have been rude to ask, though he could imagine Reeves flying to the gramophone to play precisely what he wanted. Jonathan interrupted finally, ‚ÄúAn ordinary-looking man, homburg pulled down and coat collar turned up‚Äîand one‚Äôs supposed to spot him in a crowd after seeing these two pictures?‚Äù

‚ÄúA friend of mine is going to ride the same underground from the Rathaus stop, where Bianca gets on, to the Messberg, which is the next stop and the only stop before the Steinstrasse. Look!‚Äù

This had set Reeves off again, and he showed Jonathan a street map of Hamburg which folded like an accordion and showed the U-bahn routes in blue dots.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get on the U-bahn with Fritz at the Rathaus. Fritz is coming over after dinner.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you, Jonathan wanted to say. He felt a twinge of guilt for having led Reeves on to this extent. Or had he led him on? No. Reeves had taken a crazy gamble. Reeves was probably used to such things, and he might not be the first person Reeves had approached. Jonathan was tempted to ask if he were the first person, but Reeves‚Äôs voice droned on.

‚ÄúThere is definitely the possibility of a second shooting. I don‚Äôt want to mislead you . . .‚Äù

Jonathan was glad of the bad side of it. Reeves had been presenting it all in a rosy light, the Bob‚Äôs-your-uncle shooting followed by pockets full of money and a better life in France or wherever, a cruise around the world, the best of everything for Georges (Reeves had asked his son‚Äôs name), a more secure life for Simone. How would I ever explain all the lolly to her? Jonathan wondered.

‚ÄúThis is Aalsuppe,‚Äù Reeves said, as he picked up his spoon. ‚ÄúSpecialty of Hamburg and Gaby loves to make it.‚Äù

The eel soup was very good. There was an excellent cool Moselle.

‚ÄúHamburg has a famous zoo, you know. Hagenbeck‚Äôs Tierpark in Settlingen. A nice drive from here. We might go tomorrow morning. That is‚Äù‚ÄîReeves looked suddenly more troubled‚Äî‚Äúif something doesn‚Äôt turn up for me. I‚Äôm halfway expecting something. I should know by tonight or early tomorrow.‚Äù

One would have thought the zoo was an important matter. Jonathan said, ‚ÄúTomorrow morning I get the results from the hospital. I‚Äôm supposed to be there at eleven.‚Äù Jonathan felt a despair, as if 11 a.m. might be the hour of his death.

‚ÄúYes, of course. Well, the zoo maybe in the afternoon. The animals are in a natural‚Äînatural habitat . . .‚Äù

Sauerbraten. Red cabbage.

The doorbell rang. Reeves did not get up, and in a moment Gaby came in and announced that Herr Fritz had arrived.

Fritz had a cap in his hand, and wore a rather shabby overcoat. He was about fifty.

‚ÄúThis is Paul,‚Äù said Reeves to Fritz, indicating Jonathan. ‚ÄúAn Englishman. Fritz.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood evening,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Fritz gave a friendly wave to Jonathan. Fritz was a tough one, Jonathan thought, but he had an amiable smile.

‚ÄúSit down, Fritz,‚Äù said Reeves. ‚ÄúGlass of wine? Scotch?‚Äù Reeves spoke in German. ‚ÄúPaul is our man,‚Äù he added in English to Fritz. He handed Fritz a tall, stemmed glass of white wine.

Fritz nodded.

Jonathan was amused. The oversized wine glasses looked like something out of Wagnerian opera. Reeves was sitting sideways in his chair now.

‚ÄúFritz is a taxi driver,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúTaken Herr Bianca home many an evening, eh, Fritz?‚Äù

Fritz murmured something, smiling.

‚ÄúNot many an evening, twice,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúSure, we don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù Reeves hesitated, as if not knowing in what language to speak, then continued to Jonathan, ‚ÄúBianca probably doesn‚Äôt know Fritz by sight. It doesn‚Äôt matter too much if he does, because Fritz gets off at Messberg. The point is, you and Fritz will meet outside the Rathaus U-bahn station tomorrow, and then Fritz will indicate our‚Äîour Bianca.‚Äù

Fritz nodded, apparently understanding everything.

Tomorrow now. Jonathan listened in silence.

‚ÄúNow you both get on at the Rathaus stop, that‚Äôll be around six-fifteen. Best to be there just before six, because Bianca for some reason might be early, though he‚Äôs pretty regular at six-fifteen. Karl will drive you, Paul, so there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. You don‚Äôt go anywhere near each other, you and Fritz, but it may be that Fritz has to get on the train, the same train as Bianca and you, in order to point him out definitely. In any case, Fritz gets off at Messberg, the next stop.‚Äù Then Reeves said something in German to Fritz and extended a hand.

Fritz produced from an inside pocket a small black gun and gave it to Reeves. Reeves looked at the door, as if anxious lest Gaby come in, but he didn‚Äôt seem very anxious, and the gun was hardly bigger than his palm. After fumbling a little, Reeves got the gun open and peered at its cylinders.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs loaded. Has a safety. Here. You know a little about guns, Paul?‚Äù

Jonathan had a smattering. Reeves showed him, with assistance from Fritz. The safety, that was the important thing. Be sure how to get it off. This was the Italian gun.

Fritz had to leave. He said good-bye, nodding to Jonathan. ‚ÄúBis morgen! Um sechs!‚Äù

Reeves walked with him to the door. Then Reeves came back from the hall with a brownish-red tweed topcoat, not a new coat. ‚ÄúThis is very loose,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTry it on.‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt want to try it on, but he got up and put the coat on. The sleeves were longish. Jonathan put his hands into the pockets, and found, as Reeves was now informing him, that the right-hand pocket was cut through. He was to carry the gun in his jacket pocket, and reach for it through the pocket of the coat, fire the gun preferably once and drop the gun.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see the crowd,‚Äù Reeves said, ‚Äúa couple of hundred people. You step back afterward, like everybody else, recoiling from an explosion.‚Äù Reeves illustrated, his body leaning backward, walking backward.

They drank Steinh√§ger with their coffee. Reeves asked him about his home life, Simone, Georges. Did Georges speak English or only French?

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs learning some English,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at a disadvantage, since I‚Äôm not with him a lot.‚Äù





7


Reeves telephoned Jonathan at his hotel the next morning just after 9 a.m. Karl would pick him up at 10:40 a.m. to drive him to the hospital. Rudolf would come along too. Jonathan had been sure of that.

‚ÄúGood luck,‚Äù said Reeves. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you later.‚Äù

Jonathan was downstairs in the lobby, reading a London Times, when Rudolf walked in a few minutes early. Rudolf was smiling a shy, mouselike smile, looking more like Kafka than ever.

‚ÄúMorning, Herr Trevanny!‚Äù he said.

Rudolf and Jonathan got into the back of the big car.

‚ÄúLuck with report!‚Äù said Rudolf pleasantly.

‚ÄúI intend to speak with the doctor too,‚Äù said Jonathan just as pleasantly.

He was sure Rudolf understood this, but Rudolf looked a little confused and said, ‚ÄúWir werden versuchen‚Äî‚Äù

Jonathan went with Rudolf into the hospital, though Rudolf had said he could fetch the report and also find out if the doctor was free. Karl had helpfully translated, so that Jonathan understood perfectly. Karl, in fact, seemed neutral, Jonathan thought, and probably was. The atmosphere to Jonathan was strange, however, as if everyone were acting, acting badly, even himself. Rudolf spoke with a nurse at a desk in the front hall, and asked for the report of Herr Trevanny.

The nurse looked at once in a box of sealed envelopes of various sizes, and produced one of business-letter size with Jonathan‚Äôs name on it.

‚ÄúAnd Dr. Wentzel? Is it possible to see him?‚Äù Jonathan asked the nurse.

‚ÄúDr. Wentzel?‚Äù She consulted a ledger with isinglass slots, pushed a button and lifted a telephone. Then she spoke in German for a minute, put the telephone down and said to Jonathan in English, ‚ÄúDr. Wentzel is busy all day today, his nurse says. Would you care to make an appointment for tomorrow morning at ten-thirty?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I would,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúVery good, I will make it. But his nurse says you will find a‚Äîa lot of information in the report.‚Äù

Then Jonathan and Rudolf walked back to the car. Rudolf was disappointed, Jonathan thought, or was he imagining? Anyway, Jonathan had the thick envelope in his hand, the genuine report.

In the car, Jonathan said, ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù to Rudolf, and opened the envelope. It was three typewritten pages, and Jonathan saw at a glance that many of the words were the same as the French and English terms he was familiar with. The last page, however, was two long paragraphs in German. There was the same long word for the yellow components. Jonathan‚Äôs pulse faltered at 210,000 leucocytes, which was higher than the last French report, and higher than it had ever been. Jonathan did not struggle with the last page. As he refolded the sheets, Rudolf said something in a polite tone, extending his hand, and Jonathan handed him the report, hating it, and yet what else could he do, and what did it matter?

Rudolf told Karl to drive on.

Jonathan looked out the window. He had no intention of asking Rudolf to explain anything. Jonathan preferred to work it out with a dictionary, or to ask Reeves. Jonathan‚Äôs ears began to ring, and he leaned back and made an effort to breathe deeply. Rudolf glanced at him and at once lowered a window.

Karl said over his shoulder, ‚ÄúMeine Herrn, Herr Minot expects you both to come to lunch. Then perhaps to the zoo.‚Äù

Rudolf gave a laugh and replied in German.

Jonathan thought of asking to be driven back to his hotel. But to do what? Stew over the report, not understanding all of it? Rudolf wanted to be let out somewhere. Karl dropped him beside a canal, and Rudolf extended his hand to Jonathan, shook Jonathan‚Äôs hand firmly. Then Karl drove on to Reeves Minot‚Äôs house. Sunlight twinkled on the Alster‚Äôs water. Little boats bobbed gaily at anchor, and two or three boats were sailing about, simple and clean as brand-new toys.

Gaby opened the door for Jonathan. Reeves was on the telephone, but he soon finished.

‚ÄúHello, Jonathan! What‚Äôs the news?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot too good,‚Äù said Jonathan, blinking. The sunlight in the white room was dazzling.

‚ÄúAnd the report? Can I see it? Can you understand all of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äînot all of it.‚Äù Jonathan handed the envelope to Reeves.

‚ÄúYou saw the doctor too?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down, Jonathan. Maybe you could use a drink.‚Äù Reeves went to the bottles on one of his bookshelves.

Jonathan sat on the sofa and put his head back. He felt blank and discouraged, but at least not faint at the moment.

‚ÄúA worse report than you‚Äôve been getting from the French?‚Äù Reeves returned with a scotch and water.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about it,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Reeves looked at the back page, the prose. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to watch out about minor wounds. That‚Äôs interesting.‚Äù

And nothing new, Jonathan thought. He bled easily. Jonathan waited for Reeves‚Äôs comment, in fact for Reeves‚Äôs translation.

‚ÄúRudolf translated this for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. But then I didn‚Äôt ask him to.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äò. . . cannot tell if this represents a worsened condition, not having seen a former‚Äîdiagnosis . . . sufficiently dangerous in view of the length of time‚Äîet cetera.‚Äô I‚Äôll go through it word for word, if you like,‚Äù said Reeves. ‚ÄúOne or two words I‚Äôll need the dictionary for, these compound words, but I‚Äôve got the essentials.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen just tell me the essentials.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must say they might‚Äôve written this out for you in English,‚Äù Reeves said, then scanned the page again. ‚Äú‚Äò. . . a considerable granulation of cells as well as‚Äîof the yellow‚Äîmatter. As you have had X-ray treatment, this is not to be advised again at the moment, as the leukemia cells become resistant to it . . .‚Äô‚Äù

Reeves went on for a few moments. There was no prediction of remaining time, Jonathan noticed, no hint of a deadline.

‚ÄúSince you couldn‚Äôt see Wentzel today, would you like me to try to make an appointment for you tomorrow?‚Äù Reeves sounded genuinely concerned.

‚ÄúThanks, but I made an appointment for tomorrow morning. Ten-thirty.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. And you said his nurse speaks English, so you don‚Äôt need Rudolf.‚Äî Why don‚Äôt you stretch out for a few minutes?‚Äù Reeves pulled a pillow to the corner of the sofa.

Jonathan lay back with one foot on the floor, the other foot dangling over the sofa‚Äôs edge. He felt weak and drowsy, as if he could sleep for several hours. Reeves strolled toward the sunny window, talking about the zoo. He spoke of a rare animal‚Äîthe name went out of Jonathan‚Äôs mind as soon as he heard it‚Äîthat had recently been sent from South America. A pair of them. Reeves said they must see these animals. Jonathan was thinking of Georges tugging his wagon of pebbles. Cailloux. Jonathan knew he would not live to see Georges much older, never by any means see him grow tall, hear his voice break. Jonathan sat up abruptly, clenched his teeth, and tried to will his strength back.

Gaby came in with a large tray.

‚ÄúI asked Gaby to make a cold lunch, so we can eat whenever you feel up to it,‚Äù Reeves said.

They had cold salmon with mayonnaise. Jonathan could not eat much, but the brown bread and butter and the wine tasted good. Reeves was talking about Salvatore Bianca, of the Mafia‚Äôs connection with prostitution, of their custom of employing prostitutes in their gambling establishments, and of taking 90 percent of the girls‚Äô earnings from them. ‚ÄúExtortion,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúMoney‚Äôs their objective‚Äîterror‚Äôs their method. See Las Vegas! For example, the Hamburg boys want no prostitutes,‚Äù Reeves said with an air of righteousness. ‚ÄúGirls are there, a few, helping at the bar, for instance. Maybe they‚Äôre available, but not on the premises, no indeed.‚Äù Jonathan was hardly listening, certainly not thinking about what Reeves was saying. He poked at his food, felt the blood rise to his cheeks, and held a quiet debate with himself. He would try the shooting. And it was not because he thought he was going to die in a few days or weeks, it was simply because the money was useful, because he wanted to give it to Simone and Georges. Forty thousand pounds, or ninety-six thousand dollars or‚ÄîJonathan supposed‚Äîonly half of that, if there wasn‚Äôt another shooting to do, or if he got caught on the first shooting.

‚ÄúBut you will, I think, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù Reeves asked, wiping his lips on a crisp white napkin. He meant fire the gun this evening.

‚ÄúIf something happens to me,‚Äù Jonathan said, ‚Äúcan you see that my wife gets the money?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù Reeves‚Äôs scar twitched as he smiled. ‚ÄúWhat can happen? Yes, I‚Äôll see that your wife gets the money.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if something does happen‚Äîif there‚Äôs only one shooting‚Äî‚Äù

Reeves pressed his lips together as if he didn‚Äôt like replying. ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs half the money.‚Äî But there‚Äôll likely be two, to be honest. Full payment after the second.‚Äî But that‚Äôs splendid!‚Äù He smiled, and it was the first time Jonathan had seen a real smile from him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see how easy it is tonight. And later we‚Äôll celebrate‚Äîif you‚Äôre in the mood.‚Äù He clapped his hands over his head, Jonathan thought as a gesture of jubilation, but it was a signal to Gaby.

Gaby arrived and took away the plates.

Twenty thousand pounds, Jonathan was thinking. Not so impressive, but better than a dead man with funeral expenses.

Coffee. Then the zoo. The animals Reeves had wanted him to see were two small bearlike creatures the color of butterscotch. There was a small crowd in front of them, and Jonathan never got a good view. He was also not interested. Jonathan had a good view of some lions walking in apparent freedom. Reeves was concerned that Jonathan did not become tired. It was nearly 4 p.m.

Back at Reeves‚Äôs house, Reeves insisted on giving Jonathan a tiny white pill which he called a ‚Äúmild sedative.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt need a sedative,‚Äù Jonathan said. He felt quite calm, in fact, quite well.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs best. Please take my word for it.‚Äù

Jonathan swallowed the pill. Reeves told him to lie down in the guest room for a few minutes. He did not fall asleep, and Reeves came in at 5 p.m. to say it would soon be time for Karl to drive him to his hotel. The topcoat was at Jonathan‚Äôs hotel. Reeves gave him a cup of tea with sugar, which tasted all right, and Jonathan assumed there was nothing in it but tea. Reeves gave him the gun, and showed him the safety-catch again. Jonathan put the gun in his trouser pocket.

‚ÄúSee you tonight!‚Äù Reeves said cheerily.

Karl drove him to his hotel, and said he would wait. Jonathan supposed he had five or ten minutes. He brushed his teeth‚Äîwith soap, because he‚Äôd left the toothpaste at home for Simone and Georges and hadn‚Äôt bought any as yet‚Äîthen lit a Gitane and stood looking out the window until he realized he wasn‚Äôt seeing anything, wasn‚Äôt even thinking of anything, and then he went to the closet and got the largish coat. The coat had been worn, but not much. Whose had it been? Appropriate, Jonathan thought, because he could pretend to be acting, in someone else‚Äôs clothes, pretend the gun was a blank gun in a play. But Jonathan knew he knew exactly what he was doing. Toward the Mafioso he was going to kill (he hoped) he felt no mercy. And Jonathan realized he felt no pity for himself, either. Death was death. For different reasons, Bianca‚Äôs life and his own life had lost value. The only interesting detail was that Jonathan stood to be paid for his action of killing Bianca. Jonathan put the gun in his jacket pocket and the nylon stocking in the same pocket with it. He found he could draw the stocking on to his hand with the fingers of the same hand. Nervously, he wiped the gun of fingerprints real and imaginary with the stocking-covered fingers. He would have to hold the coat aside slightly when he fired, otherwise there‚Äôd be a bullet hole in the coat. He had no hat. Curious that Reeves hadn‚Äôt thought of a hat. It was too late now to worry about it.

Jonathan went out of his room door and pulled it firmly shut.

Karl was standing on the pavement by his car. He held the door for Jonathan. Jonathan wondered how much Karl knew, and if he knew everything? Jonathan was leaning forward in the back seat, to ask Karl to go to the Rathaus U-bahn station, when Karl said over his shoulder:

‚ÄúYou are to meet Fritz at the Rathaus station. That is correct, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Jonathan, relieved. He sat back in a corner and lightly fingered the little gun. He pushed the safety on and off, remembering that forward was off.

‚ÄúHerr Minot suggested here, sir. The entrance is across the street.‚Äù Karl opened the door but did not get out, because the street was crowded with cars and people. ‚ÄúHerr Minot said I am to find you at your hotel at seven-thirty, sir,‚Äù said Karl.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Jonathan felt lost for an instant, hearing the thud of the car door closing. He looked around for Fritz. Jonathan was at a huge intersection marked Gr. Johannesstrasse and Rathaus-strasse. As in London, Piccadilly for instance, there seemed to be at least four entrances to the U-bahn here because of so many streets intersecting. Jonathan looked around for the short figure of Fritz with his cap on his head. A group of men, like a football team in topcoats, dashed down the U-bahn steps, revealing Fritz standing calmly by the metal post of the stairs, and Jonathan‚Äôs heart gave a leap as if he had met a lover at a secret rendezvous. Fritz gestured toward the steps, and went down himself.

Jonathan kept an eye on Fritz‚Äôs cap, though there were now fifteen or more people between them. Fritz moved to one side of the throng. Evidently Bianca had not come on the scene yet, and they were to await him. There was a hubbub of German around Jonathan, a burst of laughter, a shouted ‚ÄúWiedersehen, Max!‚Äù

Fritz stood against a wall some twelve feet away, and Jonathan drifted in his direction but kept a safe distance away from him, and before Jonathan reached the wall, Fritz nodded and moved diagonally away from the wall, toward a ticket gate. Jonathan bought a ticket. Fritz shuffled on in the crowd. Tickets were punched. Jonathan knew Fritz had sighted Bianca, but Jonathan didn‚Äôt see him.

A train was standing. When Fritz made a dash for a certain carriage, Jonathan dashed too. In the carriage, which was not particularly crowded, Fritz remained standing, holding on to a chromium, vertical bar. He pulled a newspaper from his pocket. Fritz nodded forward, not looking at Jonathan.

Then Jonathan saw the Italian, closer to Jonathan than to Fritz‚Äîa dark, square-faced man in a smart gray topcoat with brown leather buttons, a gray homburg, staring rather angrily straight ahead of him as if lost in thought. Jonathan looked again at Fritz who was only pretending to read his newspaper, and when Jonathan‚Äôs eyes met his, Fritz nodded and smiled slightly in confirmation.

At the next stop, Messberg, Fritz got off. Jonathan looked again at the Italian, briefly, although Jonathan‚Äôs glance seemed in no danger of distracting the Italian from the rigid stare into space. Suppose Bianca didn‚Äôt get off at the next stop, but rode on and on to a remote stop where there‚Äôd be almost no people getting off?

But Bianca moved to the door as the train slowed. Steinstrasse. Jonathan had to make an effort, without bumping anyone, to stay just behind Bianca. There was a flight of steps up. The crowd, perhaps eighty to a hundred people, flowed together more tightly in front of the stairway, and began to creep upward. Bianca‚Äôs gray topcoat was just in front of Jonathan, and they were still a couple of yards from the stairs. Jonathan could see gray hairs among the black at the back of the man‚Äôs neck, and a jagged dent in his flesh like a carbuncle scar.

Jonathan had the gun in his right hand, out of his jacket pocket. He removed the safety. Jonathan pushed his coat aside and aimed at the center of the man‚Äôs topcoat.

The gun made a raucous ‚ÄúKa-boom!‚Äù

Jonathan dropped the gun. He had stopped, and now he recoiled, backward and to the left, as a collective ‚ÄúOh-h-a‚Äî Ah-hh!‚Äù rose from the crowd. Jonathan was perhaps one of the few people who did not utter an exclamation.

Bianca had sagged and fallen.

An uneven circle of space surrounded Bianca.

‚Äú. . . Pistole . . .‚Äù

‚Äú. . . erschossen . . . !‚Äù

The gun lay on the cement, someone started to pick it up, and was stopped by at least three people from touching it. Many people, not enough interested or in a hurry, were going up the stairs. Jonathan was moving a little to the left to circle the group around Bianca. He reached the stairs. A man was shouting for the ‚ÄúPolizei!‚Äù Jonathan walked briskly, but no faster than several other people who were making their way to pavement level.

Jonathan arrived on the street, and simply walked on, straight ahead, not caring where he walked. He walked at a moderate pace and as if he knew where he was going, though he didn‚Äôt. He saw a huge railway station on his right. Reeves had mentioned that. There were no footsteps behind him, no sound of pursuit. With the fingers of his right hand, he wriggled the piece of stocking off. But he did not want to drop it so close to the underground station.

‚ÄúTaxi!‚Äù Jonathan had seen a free one, making for the railway station. It stopped, and he got in. Jonathan gave the name of the street where his hotel was.

Jonathan sank back, but he found himself glancing to right and left out the windows of the cab, as if expecting to see a policeman gesticulating, pointing to the cab, demanding that the driver stop. Absurd! He was absolutely in the clear.

Yet the same sensation came to him as he entered the Victoria ‚Äîas if the law must have got his address somehow and would be in the lobby to meet him. But no. Jonathan walked quietly into his own room and closed the door. He felt in his pocket, the jacket pocket, for the bit of stocking. It was gone, had fallen somewhere.

7:20 p.m. Jonathan took off the topcoat, dropped it in an upholstered chair, and went for his cigarettes, which he had forgotten to take with him. He inhaled the comforting smoke of Gitane. He put the cigarette on the edge of the basin in the bathroom, washed his hands and face, then stripped to the waist and washed with a face towel and hot water.

As he was pulling on a sweater, the telephone rang.

‚ÄúHerr Karl waits on you below, sir.‚Äù

Jonathan went down. He carried the topcoat over his arm. He wanted to give it back to Reeves, wanted to see the last of it.

‚ÄúGood evening, sir!‚Äù said Karl, beaming, as if he had heard the news and deemed it good.

In the car, Jonathan lit another cigarette. It was Wednesday evening. He‚Äôd said to Simone that he might be home tonight, but she probably wouldn‚Äôt have his letter till tomorrow. He thought of two books due back Saturday at the Biblioth√®que pour Tous by the church in Fontainebleau.

Jonathan was again in Reeves‚Äôs comfortable apartment. He handed the topcoat to Reeves, rather than to Gaby. Jonathan felt awkward.

‚ÄúHow are you, Jonathan?‚Äù Reeves asked, tense and concerned. ‚ÄúHow did it go?‚Äù

Gaby went away. Jonathan and Reeves were in the living room.

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúI think.‚Äù

Reeves smiled a little‚Äîeven the little making his face look radiant. ‚ÄúVery good. Fine! I hadn‚Äôt heard, you know?‚Äî May I offer you champagne, Jonathan? Or scotch? Sit down!‚Äù

‚ÄúA scotch.‚Äù

Reeves bent over the bottles. He asked in a soft voice, ‚ÄúHow many‚Äîhow many shots, Jonathan?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne.‚Äù And what if he wasn‚Äôt dead, Jonathan thought suddenly. Wasn‚Äôt that quite possible? Jonathan took the scotch from Reeves.

Reeves had a stemmed glass of champagne, and he raised the glass to Jonathan and drank. ‚ÄúNo difficulties?‚Äî Fritz did well?‚Äù

Jonathan nodded, and glanced at the door where Gaby would appear if she came back. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope he‚Äôs dead. It just occurs to me‚Äîhe might not be.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, this‚Äôll do all right if he‚Äôs not dead. You saw him fall?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù Jonathan gave a sigh, and realized he had been hardly breathing for several minutes.

‚ÄúThe news may have reached Milan already,‚Äù Reeves said cheerfully. ‚ÄúAn Italian bullet. Not that the Mafia always use Italian guns, but it was a nice little touch, I thought. He was of the Di Stefano family. There are a couple of the Genotti family here in Hamburg now too, and we hope these two families will start shooting at each other.‚Äù

Reeves had said that before. Jonathan sat down on the sofa. Reeves walked about in a glow of satisfaction.

‚ÄúIf it suits you, we‚Äôll have a quiet evening here,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúIf anyone telephones, Gaby‚Äôs going to say I‚Äôm out.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes Karl or Gaby‚Äî How much do they know?‚Äù

‚ÄúGaby‚Äînothing. Karl, it doesn‚Äôt matter if he does. Karl simply isn‚Äôt interested. He works for other people besides me, and he‚Äôs well paid. It‚Äôs in his interest not to know anything, if you follow me.‚Äù

Jonathan understood. But Reeves‚Äôs information did not make Jonathan feel any more comfortable. ‚ÄúBy the way‚ÄîI‚Äôd like to go back to France tomorrow.‚Äù This meant two things, that Reeves could pay him or make the arrangement to pay him tonight, and that any other assignment ought to be discussed tonight. Jonathan intended to say no to any other assignment, whatever the financial arrangement, but he thought he should be entitled to half the forty thousand pounds for what he had done.

‚ÄúWhy not, if you like,‚Äù said Reeves. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget you have the appointment tomorrow morning.‚Äù

But Jonathan didn‚Äôt want to see Dr. Wentzel again. He wet his lips. His report was bad, and his condition was worse. And there was another element: Dr. Wentzel with his walrus mustache represented ‚Äúauthority‚Äù somehow, and Jonathan felt that he would be putting himself in a dangerous position by confronting Wentzel again. He knew he wasn‚Äôt thinking logically, but that was the way he felt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really see any reason to see him again‚Äîsince I‚Äôm not staying any longer in Hamburg. I‚Äôll cancel the appointment early tomorrow. He‚Äôs got my Fontainebleau address for the bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt send francs out of France,‚Äù Reeves said with a smile. ‚ÄúSend me the bill when you get it. Don‚Äôt worry about that.‚Äù

Jonathan let it go. He certainly didn‚Äôt want Reeves‚Äôs name on a check to Wentzel, however. He told himself to come to the point, which was his own payment from Reeves. Instead, Jonathan sat back on the sofa and asked rather pleasantly, ‚ÄúWhat do you do here‚Äîas to work, I mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWork‚Äî‚Äù Reeves hesitated, but looked not at all disturbed by the question. ‚ÄúVarious things. I scout for New York art dealers, for example. All those books over there‚Äî‚Äù He indicated the bottom row of books in a bookshelf. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre art books, mainly German art, with names and addresses of individuals who own things. There‚Äôs a demand in New York for German painters. Then, of course, I scout among the young painters here, and recommend them to galleries and buyers in the States. Texas buys a lot. You‚Äôd be surprised.‚Äù

Jonathan was surprised. Reeves Minot‚Äîif what he said was true‚Äîmust judge paintings with the coldness of a Geiger counter. Was Reeves possibly a good judge? Jonathan had realized that the painting over the fireplace, a pinkish scene of a bed with an old person lying in it‚Äîmale or female?‚Äîapparently dying, really was a Derwatt. It must be extremely valuable, Jonathan thought, and evidently Reeves owned it.

‚ÄúRecent acquisition,‚Äù Reeves said, seeing Jonathan looking at his painting. ‚ÄúA gift‚Äîfrom a grateful friend, you might say.‚Äù He had an air of wanting to say more, but of thinking he shouldn‚Äôt.

During the dinner, Jonathan wanted to bring up the money again, and couldn‚Äôt, and Reeves started talking about something else. Ice skating on the Alster in winter, and iceboats that went like the wind and occasionally collided. Then nearly an hour later, when they were sitting on the sofa over coffee, Reeves said:

‚ÄúThis evening I can‚Äôt give you more than five thousand francs, which is absurd. No more than pocket money.‚Äù Reeves went to his desk and opened a drawer. ‚ÄúBut at least it‚Äôs in francs.‚Äù He came back with the francs in his hand. ‚ÄúI could give you an equal amount in marks tonight too.‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt want marks, didn‚Äôt want to have to change them in France. The francs, he saw, were in hundred-franc notes in pinned together batches of ten, the way French banks issued them. Reeves laid the five stacks on the coffee table, but Jonathan did not touch them.

‚ÄúYou see I can‚Äôt get any more until the rest contribute. Four or five people,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no doubt at all that I can get the marks.‚Äù

Jonathan was thinking, somewhat vaguely because he was anything but a bargainer himself, that Reeves was in a weak position asking other people for money after the deed was done. Shouldn‚Äôt his friends have put up the money first, in trust somehow, or at least more money? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it in marks, thanks,‚Äù said Jonathan.

‚ÄúNo, of course. I understand. That‚Äôs another thing, your money ought to be in Switzerland in a secret account, don‚Äôt you think? You don‚Äôt want it showing on your account in France, or you don‚Äôt want to keep it in a sock like the French, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHardly.‚Äî When can you get the half?‚Äù Jonathan asked, as if he was sure it was coming.

‚ÄúWithin a week. Don‚Äôt forget there might be a second job‚Äîin order to make the first job count for something. We‚Äôll have to see.‚Äù

Jonathan was irked and tried to conceal it. ‚ÄúWhen will you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso within a week. Maybe even in four days. I‚Äôll be in touch.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äîto be frank‚ÄîI think more money than this is only fair, don‚Äôt you? Now, I mean.‚Äù Jonathan felt his face grow warm.

‚ÄúI do. That‚Äôs why I apologized for this paltry sum. I tell you what. I shall do the very best I can, and the next you will hear from me‚Äîvia me‚Äîis the pleasant news of a Swiss bank account and a statement of the sum you have in it.‚Äù

That sounded better. ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù Jonathan asked.

‚ÄúWithin a week. My word of honor.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is‚Äîa half?‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I can get a half before‚Äî You know I explained to you, Jonathan, this was a double-barreled deal. The boys who are paying this kind of money want a certain kind of result.‚Äù Reeves looked at him.

Jonathan could see Reeves was asking, silently, was he going to do the second shooting or was he not? And if he wasn‚Äôt, say so now. ‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù Jonathan said. A little more, a third of the money even, wouldn‚Äôt be bad, Jonathan was thinking. Something like fourteen thousand pounds. For the work he had done, that was a comfortable little sum. Jonathan decided to sit tight and stop arguing tonight.

He flew back to Paris the next day on a midday plane. Reeves had said he would cancel Dr. Wentzel, and Jonathan had left it to him to do. Reeves had also said he would telephone him Saturday, day after tomorrow, in his shop. Reeves had accompanied Jonathan to the airport, and had shown him the morning paper with a picture of Bianca on the U-bahn platform. Reeves had an air of quiet triumph: there was not a clue except the Italian gun, and a Mafia killer was suspected. Bianca was labeled a Mafia soldier or button man. Jonathan had seen the front pages of the newspapers on the stands that morning when he went out to buy cigarettes, but he had had no desire to buy a newspaper. Now in the plane, he was handed a newspaper by the smiling stewardess. Jonathan left the paper folded on his lap, and closed his eyes.

It was nearly 7 p.m. when Jonathan got home, via train and taxi, and he let himself into the house with his key.

‚ÄúJon!‚Äù Simone came down the hall to greet him.

He put his arms around her. ‚ÄúHello, darling!‚Äù

‚ÄúI was expecting you!‚Äù she said, laughing. ‚ÄúSomehow. Just now.‚Äî What‚Äôs the news? Take off your coat. I had your letter this morning that you might be home last night. Are you out of your mind?‚Äù

Jonathan flung his overcoat on the hook, and picked up Georges who had just crashed against his legs. ‚ÄúAnd how‚Äôs my little pest? How‚Äôs Cailloux?‚Äù He kissed Georges‚Äô cheek. Jonathan had brought Georges a truck which dumped things and this was in the plastic bag with the whiskey, but Jonathan thought the truck could wait, and he pulled out the drink.

‚ÄúAh, quel luxe!‚Äù Simone said. ‚ÄúShall we open it now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI insist!‚Äù said Jonathan.

They went into the kitchen. Simone liked ice with scotch and Jonathan was indifferent.

‚ÄúTell me what the doctors said.‚Äù Simone took the ice tray to the sink.

‚ÄúWell‚Äîthey say about the same as the doctors here. But they want to try out some drugs on me. They‚Äôre going to let me know.‚Äù Jonathan had, on the plane, decided to say this to Simone. It would leave the way open for another trip to Germany. And what was the real use of telling her things were a trifle worse, or looked worse? What could she do about it but worry a little more? Jonathan‚Äôs optimism had risen on the plane: if he‚Äôd come well through the first episode, he might make it through the second.

‚ÄúYou mean you‚Äôll have to go back?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs possible.‚Äù Jonathan watched her pour the two scotches, generous ones. ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre willing to pay me for it. They‚Äôre going to let me know.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù said Simone, surprised.

‚ÄúIs that scotch? What do I get?‚Äù Georges said in English, with such clarity that Jonathan burst out laughing.

‚ÄúWant some? Take a sip,‚Äù Jonathan said, holding out his glass.

Simone restrained his hand. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs orange juice, Georgie!‚Äù She poured orange juice for him. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying a certain cure, you mean?‚Äù

Jonathan frowned, but he still felt master of the situation. ‚ÄúDarling, there‚Äôs no cure. They‚Äôre‚Äîthey‚Äôre going to try a lot of new pills. That‚Äôs about all I know. Cheers!‚Äù Jonathan felt a bit euphoric. He had the five thousand francs in his inside jacket pocket. He was safe, for the moment, safe in the bosom of his family. If all went well, the five thousand was merely pocket money, as Reeves Minot had said.

Simone leaned on the back of one of the straight chairs. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll pay for your going back? That means there‚Äôs some danger attached?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I think‚Äîthere‚Äôs some inconvenience attached. Going back to Germany. I only mean they‚Äôll pay my transportation.‚Äù Jonathan hadn‚Äôt worked it out: he could say that Dr. Perrier would give the injections, administer the pills. But for the moment he thought he was saying the right thing.

‚ÄúYou mean‚Äîthey consider you a special case?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. In a way. Of course I‚Äôm not,‚Äù he said, smiling. He wasn‚Äôt, and Simone knew he wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThey just might want to try some tests. I don‚Äôt know yet, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway you look awfully happy about it. I‚Äôm glad, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out to dinner tonight. The restaurant on the corner here. We can take Georges,‚Äù he protested over her voice. ‚ÄúCome on, we can afford it.‚Äù

Jonathan put four thousand of the francs into an envelope in a certain drawer among eight such drawers in a wooden cabinet at the back of his shop. This drawer was the next from the bottom drawer, and held nothing but ends of wire and string and some tags with reinforced holes‚Äîjunk that only a frugal person or an eccentric would save, Jonathan thought. It was a drawer, like the one below it (Jonathan had no idea what that contained) which Jonathan never opened ordinarily, therefore neither would Simone open it, he thought, on the rare occasions when she helped out in the shop. Jonathan‚Äôs real cash drawer was the top one on the right under his wooden counter. The remaining thousand francs Jonathan put into the joint account at the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale on Friday morning. It could be two or three weeks before Simone noticed the extra thousand, and she might not comment, even if she saw it in their checkbook. And if she did, Jonathan could say that a few customers had suddenly paid up. Jonathan usually signed checks to pay their bills, and the bankbook lived in the drawer of the √©critoire in the living room, unless one or the other of them had to take it out of the house to pay for something, which happened only about once a month.

And by Friday afternoon, Jonathan had found a way to use a little of the thousand. He bought a mustard-colored tweed suit for Simone from a shop in the Rue de France for 395 francs. He‚Äôd seen the suit days ago, before Hamburg, and thought of Simone‚Äîthe rounded collar, the dark-yellow tweed flecked with brown, the four brown buttons set in a square on the jacket had seemed created just for Simone. The price had been shocking to his eyes, more than a bit out of line, he‚Äôd thought. Now it seemed almost a bargain, and Jonathan gazed with pleasure at the new material being folded with care between snowy sheets of tissue paper. And Simone‚Äôs appreciation gave Jonathan pleasure all over again. Jonathan thought it was the first new thing she‚Äôd had, the first pretty clothes, in a couple of years, because the dresses from the market or the Prisunic didn‚Äôt count.

‚ÄúBut it must‚Äôve been terribly expensive, Jon!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äînot really. The Hamburg doctors gave me an advance‚Äîin case I have to go back. Quite generous. Don‚Äôt think about that.‚Äù

Simone smiled. She didn‚Äôt want to think about money, Jonathan saw. Not just now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll count this as one of my birthday presents.‚Äù

Jonathan smiled too. Her birthday had been almost two months ago.

On Saturday morning Jonathan‚Äôs telephone rang. It had rung a few times that morning, but this was the irregular ring of a long-distance call.

‚ÄúThis is Reeves. . . . How is everything?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, thanks.‚Äù Jonathan was suddenly tense and alert. There was a customer in his shop, a man staring at lengths of sample frame wood on Jonathan‚Äôs wall. But Jonathan was speaking in English.

Reeves said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming to Paris tomorrow and I‚Äôd like to see you. I have something for you‚Äîyou know.‚Äù Reeves sounded as calm as usual.

Simone wanted Jonathan to go to her parents‚Äô home in Nemours tomorrow. ‚ÄúCan we make it in the evening or‚Äîaround 6 p.m., say? I‚Äôve got a long lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure, I understand. French Sunday lunches! Sure, around six. I‚Äôll be at the Hotel Cayr√©. That‚Äôs on Raspail.‚Äù

Jonathan had heard of the hotel. He said he would try to be there by 6 or 7 p.m. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôre fewer trains on Sunday.‚Äù

Reeves said not to worry. ‚ÄúSee you tomorrow.‚Äù

Reeves was bringing some money, evidently. Jonathan gave his attention to the man who wanted a frame.

Simone looked marvelous on Sunday in the new suit. Jonathan asked her, before they left for the Foussadiers‚Äô, not to say that he was being paid anything by the German doctors.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fool!‚Äù Simone declared with such quick duplicity Jonathan was amused, and felt that Simone really was more with him than with her parents. Often Jonathan felt the opposite.

‚ÄúEven today,‚Äù Simone said at the Foussadiers‚Äô, ‚ÄúJon has to go to Paris to talk to a colleague of the Germans.‚Äù

It was a particularly cheerful Sunday lunch. Jonathan and Simone had brought a bottle of Johnnie Walker.

Jonathan got the 4:49 p.m. train from Fontainebleau, because there had been no train convenient from St. Pierre‚ÄìNemours, and arrived in Paris around 5:30 p.m. He took the M√©tro. There was a M√©tro stop right beside the hotel.

Reeves had left a message for Jonathan to be sent up to his room. Reeves was in shirtsleeves, and had apparently been lying on the bed reading newspapers. ‚ÄúHello, Jonathan! How is life? . . . Sit down‚Äîsomewhere. I have something to show you.‚Äù He went to his suitcase. ‚ÄúThis‚Äîas a starter.‚Äù Reeves held up a square white envelope, and took a typewritten page from it and handed it to Jonathan.

The letter was in English, addressed to the Swiss Bank Corporation, and it was signed by Ernst Hildesheim. The letter requested a bank account to be opened in the name of Jonathan Trevanny, and gave Jonathan‚Äôs shop address in Fontainebleau, and said that a check for eighty thousand marks was enclosed. The letter was a carbon, but it was signed.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Hildesheim?‚Äù Jonathan asked, meanwhile thinking that the German mark was worth about one and six-tenths French francs, so that eighty thousand marks would convert to something over a hundred and twenty thousand French francs.

‚ÄúA businessman of Hamburg‚Äîfor whom I‚Äôve done a few favors. Hildesheim‚Äôs not under any kind of surveillance and this won‚Äôt appear on his company books, so nothing for him to worry about. He sent a personal check. The point is, Jonathan, this money has been deposited in your name, posted yesterday from Hamburg, so you‚Äôll be getting your private number next week. That‚Äôs a hundred and twenty-eight thousand French francs.‚Äù Reeves didn‚Äôt smile, but he had an air of satisfaction. He reached for a box on the writing table. ‚ÄúDutch cigar? They‚Äôre very good.‚Äù

Because the cigars were something different, Jonathan took one, smiling. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù He puffed it alight from the match that Reeves held. ‚ÄúThanks also for the money.‚Äù It was not quite a third, Jonathan realized. It wasn‚Äôt a half. But Jonathan couldn‚Äôt say this.

‚ÄúNice start, yes. The casino boys in Hamburg are quite pleased. The other Mafia who‚Äôre cruising around, a couple of the Genotti family, claim they don‚Äôt know anything about Salvatore Bianca‚Äôs death, but of course they would say that. What we want to do now is knock off a Genotti as if in retaliation for Bianca. And we want to get a big shot, a capo‚Äîa chief just under the boss, you know? There‚Äôs one named Vito Marcangelo who travels nearly every weekend from Munich to Paris. He has a girlfriend in Paris. He‚Äôs the chief of the dope business in Munich‚Äîat least for his family there. Munich by the way is even more active than Marseille now, as far as dope goes . . .‚Äù

Jonathan listened uneasily, waiting for an opening in which he could say that he didn‚Äôt care to take on another job. Jonathan‚Äôs thoughts had changed in the last forty-eight hours. And it was curious, too, how Reeves‚Äôs very presence stripped Jonathan of a sense of daring‚Äîmaybe made the deed more real. Then there was the fact that he had, apparently, a hundred and twenty-eight thousand francs in Switzerland already. Jonathan had sat down on the edge of an armchair.

‚Äú. . . on a moving train, a day train, the Mozart Express.‚Äù

Jonathan shook his head. ‚ÄúSorry, Reeves. I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm up to it.‚Äù Reeves could block the check in marks, Jonathan thought suddenly. Reeves could simply cable Hildesheim. Well, so be it.

Reeves looked crestfallen. ‚ÄúOh. Well‚Äîso am I sorry. Really. We‚Äôll just have to find another man‚Äîif you won‚Äôt do it. And‚ÄîI‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll get the better part of the money too.‚Äù Reeves shook his head, puffed his cigar, and stared out the window for a moment. Then he bent and gripped Jonathan‚Äôs shoulder firmly. ‚ÄúJon, the first part went so well!‚Äù

Jonathan sat back, and Reeves released him. Jonathan squirmed, like someone forced to make an apology. ‚ÄúYes, but‚Äîto shoot somebody on a train?‚Äù Jonathan could see himself nabbed at once, unable to escape anywhere.

‚ÄúNot a shooting, no. We couldn‚Äôt have the noise. I was thinking of a garrote.‚Äù

Jonathan could hardly believe his ears.

Reeves said calmly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Mafia method. A slender cord, silent‚Äî A noose! And you pull it tight. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

Jonathan thought of his fingers touching a warm neck. It was revolting. ‚ÄúAbsolutely out of the question. I couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Reeves took a breath, going into another gear, shifting. ‚ÄúThis man is well guarded, two bodyguards as a rule. But on a train‚Äîpeople get bored sitting and walk in the aisle a bit, or they go to the bog once or twice, or the dining car, maybe alone. It might not work, Jonathan, you might not‚Äîfind the occasion, but you could try.‚Äî Then there‚Äôs pushing, just pushing him out the door. Those doors can open when the train‚Äôs moving, you know. But he‚Äôd yell‚Äîand it might not kill him either.‚Äù

Ludicrous, Jonathan thought. But he didn‚Äôt feel like laughing. Reeves dreamed on silently, looking up at the ceiling. Jonathan was thinking that if he were caught as a murderer or in an attempt at murder, Simone wouldn‚Äôt touch any of the money from it. She‚Äôd be appalled, ashamed. ‚ÄúI simply cannot help you,‚Äù Jonathan said. He stood up.

‚ÄúBut‚Äîyou could at least ride the train. If the right moment doesn‚Äôt present itself, we‚Äôll just have to think of something else, another capo maybe, another method. But we‚Äôd love to get this guy! He‚Äôs going to move from dope to the Hamburg casinos‚Äîorganizing‚Äìthat‚Äôs the rumor, anyway.‚Äù Reeves said on another note, ‚ÄúWould you try a gun, Jon?‚Äù

Jonathan shook his head. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt the nerve, for God‚Äôs sake. On a train? No.‚Äù

Look at this garrote!‚Äù Reeves pulled his left hand quickly from his trouser pocket.

He held what looked like a thin, whitish string. The end slipped through a loop, and was prevented from going all the way through by a small lump at the end of the cord. Reeves tossed it round the bedpost and pulled, jerking the cord to one side.

‚ÄúYou see? Nylon. Strong as wire almost. No one can even grunt more that once‚Äî‚Äù Reeves broke off.

Jonathan was disgusted. One would have to touch the victim with the other hand‚Äîsomehow. And wouldn‚Äôt it take about three minutes?

Reeves seemed to give it up. He strolled to a window and turned. ‚ÄúThink about it. you can ring me up or I‚Äôll ring you in a couple of days. Marcangelo usually leaves Munich noonish Fridays. It would be ideal if it could be done next weekend.‚Äù

Jonathan drifted toward the door. He put his cigar out in an ashtray on the bed table.

Reeves was looking at him shrewdly, yet he might have been gazing far behind him, thinking already of someone else for the job. His long scar looked, as it did in certain lights, thicker than it was. The scar had probably given him an inferiority complex with women, Jonathan thought. Yet how long had he had it? Maybe just two years, one couldn‚Äôt tell.

‚ÄúLike a drink downstairs?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thanks,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúOh, I have a book to show you!‚Äù Reeves went to his suitcase again, and pulled a book with a bright-red jacket from a back corner. ‚ÄúTake a look. Keep it. It‚Äôs a wonderful piece of journalism. Documentary. You‚Äôll see the kind of people we‚Äôre dealing with. But they‚Äôre flesh and blood like everyone else. Vulnerable, I mean.‚Äù

The book was called The Grim Reapers: The Anatomy of Organized Crime in America.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll telephone you Wednesday,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd come to Munich Thursday, spend the night, I‚Äôd be there at some hotel also, then you‚Äôd return Friday night to Paris by train.‚Äù

Jonathan‚Äôs hand was on the doorknob, and now he turned it. ‚ÄúSorry, Reeves, but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs no go. Bye-bye.‚Äù

Jonathan walked out of the hotel and directly across the street to the M√®tro. On the platform, awaiting a train, he read the blurb on the book jacket. On the back of the jacket were police photographs, front and profile, of six or eight unpleasant-looking men with downturned mouths, faces loose and grim at once, all with dark, staring eyes. It was curious, the similarity of their expressions, whether the faces were plump or lean. There was a section of five or six pages of photographs in the book. The chapters were titled by American cities‚ÄîDetroit, New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and at the back of the book, besides an index, was a section of Mafia families like family trees, except that these people were all contemporaries: bosses, sub-bosses, lieutenants, button men, the latter numbering fifty or sixty in the case of the Genovese family of which Jonathan had heard. The names were real, and in many cases addresses were given in New York and New Jersey. Jonathan browsed in the book on the train to Fontainebleau. There was ‚ÄúIcepick Willie‚Äù Alderman, of whom Reeves had spoken in Hamburg, who killed his victims by bending over their shoulder as if to speak to them and sticking an icepick through their eardrum. ‚ÄúIcepick Willie‚Äù was photographed, grinning, among the Las Vegas gambling fraternity of half a dozen men with Italian names and a cardinal, a bishop, and a monsignor (their names also were given) after the clergy had ‚Äúreceived a pledge of $7,500 to be spread over five years.‚Äù Jonathan closed the book in brief depression, then opened it again after a few minutes of staring out the window. The book held facts, after all, and the facts were fascinating.

Jonathan rode the bus from the Fontainebleau-Avon station to the place near the ch√¢teau, and walked up the Rue de France to his shop. He had his shop key with him, and he went in to leave the Mafia book in the seldom-used drawer with the hidden francs before he walked to his house in the Rue St. Merry.

Tom Ripley had noticed the sign FERMETURE PROVISOIRE POUR RAISONS DE FAMILLE in the window of Jonathan Trevanny‚Äôs shop on a certain Tuesday in April, and had thought that Trevanny might have gone to Hamburg. Tom was very curious indeed to know if Trevanny had gone to Hamburg, but not curious enough to telephone Reeves to ask. Then on a Thursday morning around 10 a.m. Reeves had rung from Hamburg and said in a voice tense with repressed jubilation:

‚ÄúWell, Tom, it‚Äôs done! It‚Äôs all‚Äî Everything‚Äôs fine. Tom, I thank you!‚Äù

Tom for the nonce had been wordless. Trevanny had really come through? Heloise had been in the living room where he was, so there had been little Tom could say except, ‚ÄúGood. Glad to hear it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo need of the phony doctor‚Äôs report. Everything went fine! Last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Äîand‚Äîhe‚Äôs coming back home now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Due tonight.‚Äù

Tom had made that conversation short. He had thought of Reeves‚Äôs substituting a report of Trevanny‚Äôs condition that would be worse than the truth, and Tom had suggested it in jest, although Reeves was the type to have tried it‚Äîa dirty, humorless trick, Tom thought. And it hadn‚Äôt even been necessary. Tom smiled with amazement. Tom could tell from Reeves‚Äôs joy that his intended victim was actually dead. Killed by Trevanny. Tom was indeed surprised. Poor Reeves had so wanted a word of praise from Tom for his organization of the coup, but Tom hadn‚Äôt been able to say anything: Heloise knew quite a bit of English, and Tom didn‚Äôt want to take any chances. Tom thought suddenly of looking at Mme. Annette‚Äôs Le Parisien Liber√©, which she bought every morning, but Mme. Annette was not yet back from her shopping.

‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù Heloise asked. She was looking over magazines on the coffee table, weeding out old ones to be thrown away.

‚ÄúReeves,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúNothing of importance.‚Äù

Reeves bored Heloise. He had no talent for small talk, and he looked as if he did not enjoy life.

Tom heard Mme. Annette‚Äôs steps crunching briskly on the gravel in front of the house, and he went into the kitchen to meet her. She came in through the side door, and smiled at him.

‚ÄúYou would like some more coffee, M. Tome?‚Äù she asked, setting her basket on the wooden table. An artichoke toppled from the peak.

‚ÄúNo, thank you, Mme. Annette, I came to have a look at your Parisien, if I may. The horses‚Äî‚Äù

Tom found the item on the second page. There was no photograph. An Italian named Salvatore Bianca, forty-eight, had been shot dead in an underground station in Hamburg. The assassin was unknown. A gun found on the scene was of Italian manufacture. The victim was known to be of the Di Stefano family of Mafiosi of Milan. The account was hardly three inches long. But it might be an interesting beginning, Tom thought. It might lead to much greater things. Jonathan Trevanny, the innocent-looking, positively square Trevanny, had succumbed to the temptation of money (what else?), and committed a successful murder! Tom had once succumbed himself, in the case of Dickie Greenleaf. Could it be that Trevanny was one of us? But us to Tom was only Tom Ripley. Tom smiled.

Last Sunday, Reeves had rung Tom from Orly in a dejected state, saying that Trevanny was so far declining the job, and could Tom come up with anybody else? Tom had said no. Reeves said he had written Trevanny a letter which would arrive Monday morning, inviting Trevanny to Hamburg for a medical examination. That was when Tom had said, ‚ÄúIf he comes, you could perhaps see that the report is slightly worse.‚Äù

Tom might have gone to Fontainebleau on Friday or Saturday to satisfy his curiosity and catch a glimpse of Trevanny in his shop, perhaps bring a drawing to be framed (unless Trevanny was taking the rest of the week off to recuperate), and in fact Tom had intended to go to Fontainebleau Friday for stretchers from Gauthier‚Äôs shop, but Heloise‚Äôs parents had been due for the weekend‚Äîthey had stayed Friday and Saturday nights‚Äîand on Friday the household had been in a tizzy preparing for them. Mme. Annette was worried, unnecessarily, about her menu, the quality of the fresh moules for Friday night, and after Mme. Annette had prepared the guest room to perfection, Heloise had made her change the bed-linen and the bathroom towels, because they all bore Tom‚Äôs monogram TPR and not the Plisson family‚Äôs. The Plissons had given the Ripleys two dozen magnificent heavy linen sheets from the family stock as a wedding present, and Heloise thought it only courteous and also diplomatic to use them when the Plissons visited. Mme. Annette had suffered a slight slip of memory about this, for which she certainly wasn‚Äôt reprimanded by either Heloise or Tom. Tom knew the change of bedlinen was also due to the fact that Heloise did not want her parents to be reminded by his monogram that she was married to him when they got into bed. The Plissons were critical and stuffy‚Äîa fact made somehow worse by the fact that Arl√®ne Plisson, a slender, still attractive woman of fifty, made a real effort to be informal, tolerant of the young and all that. It just wasn‚Äôt in her. The weekend had been a real ordeal, in Tom‚Äôs opinion, and good heavens, if Belle Ombre wasn‚Äôt a well-run household, then what was? The silver tea service (another wedding gift of the Plissons) was kept polished to perfection by Mme. Annette. Even the birdhouse in the garden was swept of droppings daily as if it were a miniature guesthouse on the property. Everything of wood in the house gleamed and smelled pleasantly of lavender-scented wax that Tom brought over from England. Yet Arl√®ne had said, while stretched out on the bearskin before the fireplace in a mauve trouser suit, warming her naked feet, ‚ÄúWax is not enough for such floors, Heloise. From time to time they need a treatment with linseed oil and white spirit‚Äîwarm, you know, so it soaks better into the wood.‚Äù

When the Plissons left on Sunday afternoon after tea, Heloise had snatched her middy top off and flung it at a French window which had given an awful crack because of a heavy pin on the middy, but the glass had not broken.

‚ÄúChampagne!‚Äù Heloise cried, and Tom dashed down to the cellar to fetch it.

They‚Äôd had champagne, though the tea things were not cleared away (Mme. Annette was for once putting her feet up), and then the telephone had rung.

It was Reeves Minot‚Äôs voice, sounding downcast. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at Orly. Just leaving for Hamburg. I saw our mutual friend in Paris today and he says no to the next‚Äîthe next, you know. There‚Äôs got to be one more, I know that. I explained that to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve paid him something?‚Äù Tom watched Heloise waltzing with her champagne glass in hand. She was humming the grand waltz from Der Rosenkavalier.

‚ÄúYes, about a third, and I think that‚Äôs not bad. I‚Äôve put it in Switzerland for him.‚Äù

Tom thought he recalled a promised sum of nearly five hundred thousand francs. A third was not munificent, but it was reasonable, Tom supposed. ‚ÄúYou mean another shooting,‚Äù Tom said.

Heloise was singing and twirling. ‚ÄúLa-da-da-la-dee-dee . . .‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Reeves‚Äôs voice cracked. He said softly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to be a garrote. On a train. I think that‚Äôs the hitch.‚Äù

Tom was shocked. Of course Trevanny wouldn‚Äôt do it. ‚ÄúMust it be on a train?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a plan . . .‚Äù

Reeves always had a plan. Tom listened politely. Reeves‚Äôs idea sounded dangerous and uncertain. Tom interrupted. ‚ÄúMaybe our friend has had enough at this stage.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I think he‚Äôs interested. But he won‚Äôt agree‚Äîto come to Munich, and we need the job done by next weekend.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been reading The Godfather again, Reeves. Make some arrangement with a gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúA gun makes noise,‚Äù Reeves said without a flicker of humor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering‚Äîeither I come up with someone else, Tom, or‚ÄîJonathan‚Äôs got to be persuaded.‚Äù

Impossible to persuade him, Tom thought, and Tom said rather impatiently, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better persuasion than money. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù Tom was unpleasantly reminded of the visit of the Plissons. Would he and Heloise have bent over backward, strained themselves for nearly three days, if they didn‚Äôt need the twenty-five thousand francs a year that Jacques Plisson gave Heloise as an allowance?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid if he‚Äôs paid any more,‚Äù Reeves said, ‚Äúhe really will quit. I‚Äôve told you, maybe, I can‚Äôt get it‚Äîthe rest of the dough‚Äîuntil he does the second job.‚Äù

Tom was thinking that Reeves didn‚Äôt understand Trevanny‚Äôs type at all. If Trevanny was paid in full, he‚Äôd either do the job or return half the money.

‚ÄúIf you think of something in regard to him,‚Äù Reeves said with apparent difficulty, ‚Äúor if you know of anyone else who could do it, telephone me, will you? In the next day or so?‚Äù

Tom was glad when they‚Äôd hung up. He shook his head quickly, and blinked his eyes. Reeves Minot‚Äôs ideas often gave Tom the feeling of being befogged by some heavy dream that hadn‚Äôt even the reality of most dreams.

Heloise hurdled the back of the yellow sofa, one hand gently touching the sofa back, the other holding her glass of champagne, and she landed silently, seated. Elegantly, she lifted her glass to him. ‚ÄúGrace √† toi, ce weekend √©tait tr√®s r√©ussi, mon tr√©sor!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, my darling!‚Äù

Yes, life was sweet again, they were alone again, they could dine tonight barefoot if they chose. Freedom!

Tom was thinking of Trevanny. Tom didn‚Äôt really care about Reeves, who always scraped through, or pulled out in the nick of time from a situation that became too dangerous. But Trevanny‚Äîthere was a bit of a mystery. Tom cast about for a way of making better acquaintance with Trevanny. The situation was difficult, because he knew that Trevanny didn‚Äôt like him. But there was nothing simpler than taking a picture to Trevanny to frame.

On Tuesday, Tom drove to Fontainebleau and went first to Gauthier‚Äôs art supply shop to buy stretchers. Gauthier might volunteer some news about Trevanny, something about his Hamburg trip, Tom thought, since ostensibly Trevanny had gone to consult a doctor. Tom made his purchases at Gauthier‚Äôs, but Gauthier did not mention Trevanny. Just as he was leaving, Tom said:

‚ÄúAnd how is our friend‚ÄîM. Trevanny?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, oui. He went to Hamburg last week to see a specialist.‚Äù Gauthier‚Äôs glass eye glared at Tom, while the live eye glistened and looked a bit sad. ‚ÄúI understand the news was not good. A little worse, perhaps, than what his doctor here tells him. But he is courageous. You know these English, they never show their real feelings.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear he‚Äôs worse,‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúYes, well‚Äîso he told me. But he carries on.‚Äù

Tom put his stretchers in his car, and took a portfolio from the backseat. He had brought a watercolor for Trevanny to frame. His conversation with Trevanny might not go well today, Tom thought, but the fact that he would have to pick up his picture at some future date would ensure that he had a second chance to see Trevanny. Tom walked to the Rue des Sablons, and went into the little shop. Trevanny was discussing a frame with a woman, holding a strip of wood against the top of an etching. He glanced at Tom, and Tom was sure Trevanny recognized him.

‚ÄúIt may look heavy now, but with a white mat‚Äî‚Äù Trevanny was saying. Trevanny‚Äôs accent was quite good.

Tom looked for some change in Trevanny‚Äîa sign of anxiety, perhaps‚Äîbut so far he saw none. At last it was Tom‚Äôs turn. ‚ÄúBonjour. Good morning. Tom Ripley,‚Äù Tom said, smiling. ‚ÄúI was at your house in‚Äîin February, wasn‚Äôt it? Your wife‚Äôs birthday.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù

Tom could see in Trevanny‚Äôs face that his attitude hadn‚Äôt changed since that night in February when he had said, ‚ÄúOh, yes, I‚Äôve heard of you.‚Äù Tom opened his portfolio. ‚ÄúI have a watercolor. Done by my wife. I thought perhaps a narrow dark-brown frame, a mat‚Äîsay, two and a half inches at the widest, at the bottom.‚Äù

Trevanny gave his attention to the watercolor which lay on the notched, sleek-worn counter between them.

The picture was mainly green and purple, Heloise‚Äôs free interpretation of a corner of Belle Ombre backgrounded by the pine woods in winter. It was not bad, Tom thought, because Heloise had known when to stop. She had no idea Tom had saved it, and to see it framed was going to be a pleasant surprise for her, Tom hoped.

‚ÄúSomething like this, perhaps,‚Äù Trevanny said, pulling down a length of wood from a shelf where a confusion of pieces stuck out. He laid it above the picture at a distance that the mat would take up.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs nice, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúMat off-white or white? Such as this?‚Äù

Tom made his decision. Trevanny printed Tom‚Äôs name and address carefully on a pad. Tom gave his telephone number too.

What to say now? Trevanny‚Äôs coolness was almost palpable. Tom knew Trevanny would decline, but felt he had nothing to lose, so he said, ‚ÄúPerhaps you and your wife would come to my house for a drink some time. Villeperce isn‚Äôt far. Bring your little boy, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks. I have no car,‚Äù Trevanny said with a polite smile. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt go out very much, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

‚ÄúA car‚Äôs no problem. I could fetch you. And of course count on having some dinner with us too.‚Äù The words tumbled out of Tom. Now Trevanny shoved his hands into the pockets of his coat sweater, and shifted on his feet as if his will were shifting. Tom sensed that Trevanny was curious about him.

‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs shy,‚Äù said Trevanny, smiling for the first time. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt speak much English.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither does my wife, really. She‚Äôs French too, you know. However‚Äîif my house is too far away, what‚Äôs the matter with a pastis now? Aren‚Äôt you about to close?‚Äù

Trevanny was. It was a little after noon.

They walked to a bar-restaurant at the corner of Rue de France and Rue St. Merry. Trevanny had stopped at a bakery to buy bread. He ordered a draught beer, and Tom had the same. Tom put a ten-franc note on the counter.

‚ÄúHow did you happen to come to France?‚Äù Tom asked.

Trevanny told Tom about starting an antique shop in France with an English chum. ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù asked Trevanny.

‚ÄúOh, my wife likes it here. And so do I. I can‚Äôt think of a more pleasant life really. I can travel if I wish. I have lots of free time‚Äîleisure you‚Äôd call it. Gardening and painting. I paint like a Sunday painter, but I enjoy it.‚Äî Whenever I feel like it, I go to London for a couple of weeks.‚Äù That was cards on the table, in a way, na√Øve, harmless. Except that Trevanny might wonder where the money came from. Tom thought it probable that Trevanny had heard the Dickie Greenleaf story, forgotten most of it as most people did, except that certain things stayed in the memory, like Dickie Greenleaf‚Äôs ‚Äúmysterious disappearance,‚Äù though later Dickie‚Äôs suicide had been accepted as fact. Possibly Trevanny knew that Tom got some income from what Dickie Greenleaf had left in his will (a will that Tom had forged), because this had been in the papers. Then there‚Äôd been the Derwatt affair last year, not so much ‚ÄúDerwatt‚Äù in the French papers as the strange disappearance of Thomas Murchison, the American who had been a guest at Tom‚Äôs home.

‚ÄúSounds a pleasant life,‚Äù Trevanny remarked dryly, and wiped foam from his upper lip.

Trevanny wanted to ask him something, Tom felt. What? Tom was wondering whether, for all his English cool, Trevanny could suffer a fit of conscience and either tell his wife or go to the police and confess? Tom thought he was right in assuming Trevanny hadn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt tell his wife what he had done. Just five days ago Trevanny had pulled a trigger and killed a man. Of course Reeves would have given Trevanny pep talks, morale-building lectures on the viciousness of the Mafia and the positive good Trevanny or anybody would do by eliminating one of them. Then Tom thought of the garrote. No, he could not see Trevanny using a garrote. How did Trevanny feel about the killing he had done? Or had he had time to feel anything yet? Maybe not. Trevanny lit a Gitane. He had large hands. He was the type who could wear old clothes, unpressed trousers, and still have the air of a gentleman. And he had rugged good looks that he himself seemed quite unaware of.

‚ÄúDo you happen to know,‚Äù said Trevanny, looking at Tom with his calm blue eyes, ‚Äúan American called Reeves Minot?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúLives here in Fontainebleau?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. But he travels a lot, I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Tom drank his beer.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd better push off. My wife‚Äôs expecting me.‚Äù

They went out. They had to go in different directions.

‚ÄúThanks for the beer,‚Äù Trevanny said.

‚ÄúA pleasure!‚Äù

Tom walked to his car which was in the parking area in front of the H√¥tel de l‚ÄôAigle Noir, and drove off for Villeperce. He was thinking about Trevanny, thinking that he was a rather disappointed man, disappointed in his present situation. Surely Trevanny had had aspirations in his youth. Tom remembered Trevanny‚Äôs wife, an attractive woman who looked steady and devoted, the kind of woman who would never push her husband to better his situation, never nag at him to earn more money. In her way, Trevanny‚Äôs wife was probably as upright and decent as Trevanny himself. Yet Trevanny had succumbed to Reeves‚Äôs proposal. That meant that Trevanny was a man who could be pushed or pulled in any direction, if one did it intelligently.

Mme. Annette greeted Tom with the message that Heloise would be a little late, because she had found an English commode de bateau in an antique shop in Chilly-en-Bi√®re, had signed a check for it, but had to accompany the antique man to the bank. ‚ÄúShe will be home with the commode at any minute!‚Äù said Mme. Annette, her blue eyes sparkling. ‚ÄúShe asks you to wait lunch for her, M. Tome.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut of course!‚Äù said Tom just as cheerily. The bank account was going to be slightly overdrawn, he thought, which was why Heloise had to go to the bank and talk to someone‚Äîand how would she manage that during the lunch period when the bank was closed? And Mme. Annette was joyous because still another piece of furniture was entering the house which she could get to work on with her indefatigable waxing. Heloise had been looking for a nautical, brassbound chest of drawers for Tom for months. It was a whim of hers to see a commode de bateau in his room.

Tom decided to seize the moment and try Reeves, and he ran up to his room. It was 1:22 p.m. Belle Ombre had two new dial telephones since about three months, and one no longer had to get a long-distance number through the operator.

Reeves‚Äôs housekeeper answered, and Tom used his German and asked if Herr Minot was in. He was.

‚ÄúReeves, hello! Tom. I can‚Äôt talk long. I just wanted to say I‚Äôve seen our friend. Had a drink with him . . . In a bar in Fontainebleau. I think‚Äî‚Äù Tom was standing up, tense, staring through the window at the trees across the road, at the empty blue sky. He was not sure what he wanted to say, except that he wanted to tell Reeves to keep trying. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I think it might work with him. It‚Äôs only a hunch. But try again with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù said Reeves, hanging on his words as if he were an oracle that never failed.

‚ÄúWhen do you expect to see him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll come Thursday to Munich. Day after tomorrow. I‚Äôm trying to persuade him to consult another doctor there. Then‚Äîon Friday the train leaves around two-ten from Munich to Paris, you know.‚Äù

Tom had once taken the Mozart Express, boarding it at Salzburg. ‚ÄúI would say, give him a choice of a gun and‚Äîthe other thing, but advise him not to use the gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúI did try that!‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúBut you think‚Äîhe might still come around, eh?‚Äù

Tom heard a car, two cars, roll on to the gravel in front of the house. It was no doubt Heloise with the antique dealer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to sign off, Reeves. Right now.‚Äù

Later that day, alone in his room, Tom examined more closely the handsome commode which had been installed between his two front windows. The chest was of oak, low and solid, with shining brass corners and countersunk brass drawer pulls. The polished wood looked alive, as if animated by the hands of the maker, or maybe by the hands of the captain or captains or officers who had used it. A couple of shiny, darkish dents in the wood were like the odd scars that every living thing acquired in the course of life. An oval plaque of silver was set into the top, and on it was engraved in scrolly letters Capt. Archibald L. Partridge, Plymouth, 1734, and in much smaller letters the name of the carpenter, which Tom thought a nice touch of pride.

On Wednesday, as Reeves had promised, he telephoned Jonathan at his shop. Jonathan was unusually busy and had to ask Reeves to ring back just after noon.

Reeves did ring back, and after his usual courtesies, asked if Jonathan would be able to come to Munich the following day.

‚ÄúThere are doctors in Munich too, you know, very good ones. I have one in mind, Dr. Max Schroeder. I‚Äôve found out he could see you early Friday, around eight in the morning. All I have to do is confirm it. If you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù said Jonathan, who had anticipated that the conversation would go exactly like this. ‚ÄúVery good, Reeves. I‚Äôll see about my ticket‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOne-way, Jonathan.‚Äî Well, that‚Äôs up to you.‚Äù

Jonathan knew. ‚ÄúWhen I find out the plane time, I‚Äôll ring you back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know the times. There‚Äôs a plane leaving Orly at one-fifteen p.m. direct to Munich, if you can make it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right. I‚Äôll aim for that.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt hear from you, I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre on it. I‚Äôll meet you at the town terminus as before.‚Äù

Absentmindedly, Jonathan went to his sink, smoothed his hair with both hands, then reached for his mac. It was raining a little and rather chilly. Jonathan had made his decision yesterday. He would go through the same movements again, visit a doctor in Munich this time, and he would board the train. The dubious part to Jonathan was his own nerve. Just how far would he be able to go? He walked out of his shop and locked the door with his key.

Jonathan bumped into a rubbish bin on the pavement, and realized that he was trudging along instead of walking. He raised his head a little. He‚Äôd demand to have a gun as well as the noose, and if he balked at using the noose because of a failure of nerve (which Jonathan fully expected), and he used the gun, then that was that. Jonathan would make an arrangement with Reeves: if he used the gun, if it was obvious that he was going to be caught, then he would use the next bullet or two for himself. That way he could never possibly betray Reeves and the other people Reeves was connected with. For this, Reeves would pay the rest of the money to Simone. Jonathan realized that his corpse couldn‚Äôt be taken for that of an Italian, but he supposed it was possible that the Di Stefano family could have hired a non-Italian killer.

Jonathan said to Simone, ‚ÄúI had a telephone call from the Hamburg doctor this morning. He wants me to go to Munich tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? So soon?‚Äù

Jonathan remembered he had told Simone it might be a fortnight before the doctors wanted to see him again. He had said Dr. Wentzel had given him some pills whose result he would want to check. There had in fact been a conversation about pills with Dr. Wentzel‚Äîthere was nothing really to do with leukemia except try to slow it up with pills‚Äîbut Dr. Wentzel had not given him any. Jonathan was sure Dr. Wentzel would have given him pills if he had seen him a second time. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another doctor in Munich‚Äîsomeone called Schroeder‚ÄîDr. Wentzel wants me to see.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is Munich?‚Äù asked Georges.

‚ÄúIn Germany,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúHow long will you be gone?‚Äù Simone asked.

‚ÄúProbably‚Äîtill Saturday morning,‚Äù Jonathan said, thinking that the train might come in so late Friday night, there wouldn‚Äôt be a train out of Paris to Fontainebleau.

‚ÄúAnd what about the shop? Would you like me to be there tomorrow morning? And Friday morning?‚Äî What time must you leave tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a plane at one-fifteen. Yes, darling, it would be a help if you could look in tomorrow morning and Friday morning‚Äîeven for an hour. There‚Äôll be a couple of people calling for pictures.‚Äù Jonathan stabbed his knife gently into a piece of Camembert which he had taken and didn‚Äôt want.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried, Jon?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äî No, on the contrary, any news I get ought to be slightly better news.‚Äù Polite cheerfulness, Jonathan thought, and it was really rubbish. The doctors couldn‚Äôt do anything against time. He glanced at his son who looked a bit puzzled, but not puzzled enough to ask another question, and Jonathan realized that Georges had been overhearing such conversations since he could understand speech. Georges had been told, ‚ÄúYour father has a germ. Like a cold. It makes him tired sometimes. But you cannot catch it. Nobody can catch it, so it is not going to hurt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you sleep at the hospital?‚Äù Simone asked.

Jonathan didn‚Äôt understand what she meant at first. ‚ÄúNo. Dr. Wentzel‚Äîhis secretary said they‚Äôd booked a hotel for me.‚Äù

Jonathan left the house the next morning just after 9 a.m., in order to catch the 9:42 a.m. to Paris, because the next train later would have made him too late for Orly. He had bought his ticket, one-way, the preceding afternoon, and he had also put another thousand francs into the account at the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and five hundred in his wallet, which left two thousand five hundred in the drawer in his shop. He had also removed The Grim Reapers from the drawer and stuck it into his suitcase to give back to Reeves.

Just before 5 p.m., Jonathan got off the bus which had brought him to the Munich city terminus. It was a sunny day, the temperature pleasant. There were a few sturdy, middle-aged men in leather shorts and green jackets, and a hurdy-gurdy played on the pavement. He saw Reeves trotting toward him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little late, sorry!‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúHow are you, Jonathan?‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite well, thank you,‚Äù Jonathan said, smiling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you a hotel room. We‚Äôll get a taxi now. I‚Äôm in a different hotel, but I‚Äôll come up with you and we‚Äôll talk.‚Äù

They got into a taxi. Reeves talked about Munich. He talked as if he really knew the city and liked it, not as if he were talking out of nervousness. Reeves had a map, and pointed out ‚Äúthe English Garden,‚Äù which their taxi was not going to pass, and the section bordering the river Isar, where Reeves told him his appointment was tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. Both their hotels were in the central area, Reeves said. The taxi stopped at a hotel, and a boy in dark-red uniform opened the taxi door.

Jonathan registered. The lobby had lots of modern stained-glass panels depicting German knights and troubadours. Jonathan was pleasantly aware that he felt unusually well, and therefore cheerful. Was it a prelude to some awful news tomorrow, some awful catastrophe? It struck Jonathan as insane to feel cheerful, and he cautioned himself, as he might if he were on the verge of taking a drink too many.

Reeves came with him up to his room. The bellhop was just leaving, having deposited Jonathan‚Äôs suitcase. Jonathan stuck his topcoat on a hook in the hall, as he might have done at home.

‚ÄúTomorrow morning‚Äîeven this afternoon we might get you a new topcoat,‚Äù Reeves said, looking with a somewhat pained expression at Jonathan‚Äôs.

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Jonathan had to admit his coat was pretty shabby. He smiled a little, unresentful. At least he‚Äôd brought his good suit, his rather new black shoes. He hung up the blue suit.

‚ÄúAfter all, you‚Äôll be in first class on the train,‚Äù Reeves said. He walked to the door and slid the button which made it impossible for anyone outside to enter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the gun. Another Italian gun, a little different. I couldn‚Äôt get a silencer but I thought‚Äîto tell you the truth‚Äîa silencer wouldn‚Äôt make all that much difference.‚Äù

Jonathan understood. He looked at the small gun that Reeves had pulled from some pocket, and felt for an instant empty, stupid. To fire this gun at all meant that he‚Äôd have to shoot himself immediately afterward. That was the only meaning the gun had for him.

‚ÄúAnd this, of course,‚Äù said Reeves, pulling the garrote from his pocket.

In the brighter light of Munich, the cord had a pallid, flesh-like color.

‚ÄúTry it on the‚Äîthe back of that chair,‚Äù Reeves said.

Jonathan took the cord and dropped its loop over a projection at the back corner of a chair. He pulled it indifferently until it was tight. He was not even disgusted now, he merely felt blank. Would the average person, he wondered, finding the cord in his pocket or anywhere, know at once what it was? Probably not, Jonathan thought.

‚ÄúYou must jerk it, of course,‚Äù said Reeves, solemnly, ‚Äúand keep it tight.‚Äù

Jonathan felt suddenly annoyed, started to say something ill-tempered and checked himself. He took the cord off the chair, and was about to drop it on the bed, when Reeves said:

‚ÄúKeep that in your pocket. Or the pocket of whatever suit you‚Äôre going to wear tomorrow.‚Äù

Jonathan started to put it in the pocket of the trousers he was wearing, then went and stuck it in a pocket of the trousers of his blue suit.

‚ÄúAnd these two pictures I‚Äôd like to show you.‚Äù Reeves took an envelope from his inside jacket pocket. The unsealed white envelope held two photographs, one glossy and the size of a postcard, the other a neatly clipped newspaper picture folded twice. ‚ÄúVito Marcangelo.‚Äù

Jonathan looked at the glossy photograph, which was cracked in a couple of places. It showed a man with a round head and face, heavy curvaceous lips, with wavy black hair. A streak of gray at either temple gave an impression of steam spewing from his head.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs about five six,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúHis hair is still gray there, he doesn‚Äôt touch it up. And here he is partying.‚Äù

The newspaper photograph was of three men and a couple of women standing behind a dinner table. An inked arrow pointed to a short, laughing man with a gray blaze at his temple. The caption was in German.

Reeves took the pictures back. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go down for the topcoat. Something‚Äôll be open. By the way the safety on that gun works the same as on the other gun. It‚Äôs loaded with six bullets. I‚Äôll put it in here, all right?‚Äù Reeves took the gun from the foot of the bed, and put it in a corner of Jonathan‚Äôs suitcase. ‚ÄúBriennerstrasse‚Äôs very good for shopping,‚Äù Reeves said as they rode down in the lift.

They walked. Jonathan had left his topcoat in his hotel room.

Jonathan chose a dark-green tweed. Who was paying for it? That didn‚Äôt seem to matter much. Jonathan also thought that he might have only about twenty-four hours to wear it. Reeves insisted on paying for the coat, though Jonathan said he could pay Reeves back when he changed some francs into marks.

‚ÄúNo, no, my pleasure,‚Äù said Reeves, jerking his head a little, which was sometimes his equivalent of a smile.

Jonathan wore the coat out of the shop. Reeves pointed out things to him as they walked‚ÄîOdeonsplatz, the beginning of Ludwigstrasse, which Reeves said went on to Schwabing, the district where Thomas Mann had had his house. They walked to the Englischer Garten, then took a taxi to a beerhall. Jonathan would have preferred tea. He realized that Reeves was trying to make him relax. Jonathan felt relaxed enough, and was not even worried about what Dr. Max Schroeder would say tomorrow morning. Rather, whatever Dr. Schroeder would say simply wouldn‚Äôt matter.

They dined in a noisy restaurant in Schwabing, and Reeves informed him that practically everyone in the place was ‚Äúan artist or a writer.‚Äù Jonathan was amused by Reeves. Jonathan felt a bit swimmy in the head from all the beer, and now they were drinking Gumpoldsdinger.

Before midnight, Jonathan stood in his hotel room in his pajamas. He had just had a shower. The telephone would ring at 7:15 tomorrow morning, followed at once by a continental breakfast. Jonathan sat down at the writing table, took some notepaper from the drawer, and addressed an envelope to Simone. Then he remembered he‚Äôd be home day after tomorrow, even perhaps tomorrow night late. He crumpled the envelope and tossed it into the wastebasket. Tonight during dinner he had said to Reeves, ‚ÄúDo you know a man called Tom Ripley?‚Äù Reeves had looked blank and said, ‚ÄúNo. Why?‚Äù Jonathan got into bed and pressed a button which, conveniently, extinguished all the lights, including the one in the bathroom. Had he taken his pills tonight? Yes. Just before his shower. He‚Äôd put the pill bottle in his jacket pocket, so he could show them to Dr. Schroeder tomorrow, in case the doctor was interested.

Reeves had asked, ‚ÄúDid the Swiss bank write you yet?‚Äù They hadn‚Äôt, but a letter from them might well have come this morning to his shop, Jonathan thought. Would Simone open it? The chances were fifty-fifty, Jonathan thought, depending on how busy she was in the shop. The Swiss letter would confirm a deposit of eighty thousand marks, and there‚Äôd probably be cards for him to sign as samples of his signature. The envelope, Jonathan supposed, would have no return address on it, or nothing identifiable as a bank. Since he was returning Saturday, Simone might leave any letters unopened. Fifty-fifty, he thought again, and slid gently into sleep.

IN THE HOSPITAL THE NEXT MORNING, the atmosphere seemed strictly routine and curiously informal. Reeves was present the whole time, and Jonathan could tell, though the conversation was all in German, that Reeves did not tell Dr. Schroeder about a previous examination in Hamburg. The Hamburg report was now in the charge of Dr. Perrier in Fontainebleau, who must by now have sent it to the Ebberle-Valent Laboratory, as he had promised to do.

Again a nurse spoke perfect English. Dr. Max Schroeder was about fifty, with black hair modishly down to his shirt collar.

‚ÄúHe says more or less,‚Äù Reeves told Jonathan, ‚Äúthat it is a classic case with‚Äînot so cheerful predictions for the future.‚Äù

No, there was nothing new for Jonathan. Not even the message that the results of the examination would be ready for Jonathan tomorrow morning.

It was nearly 11 a.m. when Jonathan and Reeves walked out of the hospital. They walked along an embankment of the Isar, where there were children in prams, stone apartment buildings, a pharmacy, a grocery shop, all the appurtenances of living of which Jonathan felt not in the least a part that morning. He had to remember even to breathe. Today was going to be a day of failure, he thought. He wanted to plunge into the river and possibly drown, or become a fish. Reeves‚Äôs presence and his sporadic talking irked him. He managed not to hear Reeves finally. Jonathan felt that he was not going to kill anyone today, not by the string in his pocket, not by the gun either.

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt I think about getting my suitcase,‚Äù Jonathan interrupted, ‚Äúif the train‚Äôs at two something?‚Äù

They found a taxi.

Almost beside the hotel there was a shop window of twinkling objects, glowing with gold and silver lights like a German Christmas tree. Jonathan drifted toward the window. It was mostly tourist trinkets, he saw with disappointment, but then he noticed a gyroscope poised at a slant against its square box.

‚ÄúI want to buy something for my son,‚Äù Jonathan said, and went into the shop. He pointed and said, ‚ÄúBitte,‚Äù and acquired the gyroscope without noticing the price. He had changed two hundred francs at the hotel that morning.

Jonathan had already packed, so all he had to do was close his suitcase. He took it down himself. Reeves stuck a hundred-mark note into Jonathan‚Äôs hand, and asked him to pay the hotel bill, because it might look odd if Reeves paid it. Money had ceased to matter to Jonathan.

They were early at the station. In the buffet, Jonathan didn‚Äôt want anything to eat, only coffee.

So Reeves ordered coffee. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to make the opportunity yourself, I realize, Jon. It may not work out, I know, but this man we want . . . Stay near the restaurant car. Smoke a cigarette, stand at the end of the carriage next to the restaurant car, for instance . . .‚Äù

Jonathan had a second coffee. Reeves bought a Daily Telegraph and a paperback for Jonathan to take with him.

Then the train pulled in, daintily clicking on the rails, sleek gray and blue‚Äîthe Mozart Express. Reeves was looking for Marcangelo, who was supposed to board now with at least two bodyguards. There were perhaps sixty people getting on all along the platform, and as many getting off. Reeves grabbed Jonathan‚Äôs arm and pointed. Jonathan was standing with suitcase in hand by the carriage he was supposed to enter, according to his ticket. Jonathan saw‚Äîor did he?‚Äîthe group of three men that Reeves was talking about, three shortish men in hats climbing the steps two carriages away from Jonathan‚Äôs and more toward the front of the train.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him. I saw the gray in his hair even,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúNow where‚Äôs the restaurant car?‚Äù He stepped back to see better, trotted toward the front of the train, and came back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the one in front of Marcangelo‚Äôs.‚Äù

The train‚Äôs departure was being announced in French now.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the gun in your pocket?‚Äù Reeves asked.

Jonathan nodded. Reeves had reminded him, when he went up to his hotel room for his suitcase, to put it in his pocket. ‚ÄúSee that my wife gets the money, whatever happens to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a promise.‚Äù Reeves patted his arm.

The whistle blew for a second time, and doors banged. Jonathan got on the train and didn‚Äôt look back at Reeves, who he knew would be following him with his eyes. Jonathan found his seat. There were only two other people in the compartment, which was for eight passengers. The upholstery was dark-red plush. Jonathan put his suitcase on an overhead rack, then his new coat, folded inside out. A young man entered the compartment, and hung out of the window, talking to someone in German. Jonathan‚Äôs other companions were a middle-aged man sunk in what looked like office papers, and a neat little woman wearing a small hat and reading a novel. Jonathan‚Äôs seat was next to the businessman, who had the window seat facing the way the train was moving. Jonathan opened his Telegraph.

It was 2:11 p.m.

Jonathan watched the outskirts of Munich glide past, office buildings, onion towers. Opposite Jonathan were three framed photographs‚Äîa ch√¢teau somewhere, a lake with a couple of swans, some snow-topped Alps. The train purred over smooth rails and rocked gently. Jonathan half closed his eyes. By locking his fingers and putting his elbows on the armrests, he could almost doze. There was time, time to make up his mind, change his mind, change back again. Marcangelo was going to Paris like him, and the train didn‚Äôt arrive until 11:07 p.m. tonight. A stop came at Strassburg around 6:30 p.m., he remembered Reeves saying. A few minutes later, Jonathan came awake and realized there was a thin but regular traffic of people in the aisle beyond the glass-doored compartment. A man came partway into the compartment with a trolley of sandwiches, bottles of beer and wine. The young man bought a beer. A stocky man stood smoking a pipe in the aisle, and from time to time pushed himself against the window to let others pass him.

No harm in strolling past Marcangelo‚Äôs compartment, as if en route to the restaurant car, Jonathan thought, just to size up the situation a bit, but it took Jonathan several minutes to muster his initiative, during which time he smoked a Gitane. He put the ashes into the metal receptacle fixed under the window, careful not to drop any on the knees of the man reading office papers.

At last Jonathan got up and walked forward. The door at the end of the carriage was sticky to open. There was another pair of doors before he reached Marcangelo‚Äôs carriage. Jonathan walked slowly, bracing himself against the gentle but irregular swaying of the train, glancing into each compartment. Marcangelo‚Äôs was instantly recognizable, because Marcangelo was facing Jonathan in a center seat, asleep with hands folded across his abdomen, jowls sunk into his collar, the gray streak at the temple flowing back and up. Jonathan had a quick impression of two other Italian types leaning toward each other, talking and gesticulating. There was no one else in the compartment, Jonathan thought. He went on to the end of the carriage and on to the platform, where he lit another cigarette and stood looking out the window. This end of the carriage had a WC, which now showed a red tag in its circular lock, indicating that it was occupied. Another man, bald and slender, stood by the opposite window, perhaps waiting for the WC. The idea of trying to kill anyone here was absurd, because there were bound to be witnesses. Or even if only killer and victim were on the platform, wouldn‚Äôt someone very likely appear in a matter of seconds? The train was not at all noisy, and if a man cried out, even with the garrote already around his neck, wouldn‚Äôt the people in the first compartment hear him?

A man and a woman came out of the restaurant car, and went into the carriage aisle, not closing the doors, though a white-jacketed waiter at once did this.

Jonathan walked back in the direction of his own carriage, and glanced once more into Marcangelo‚Äôs compartment, but very briefly. Marcangelo was smoking a cigarette, leaning forward fatly, talking.

If it was done, it ought to be done before Strassburg, Jonathan thought. He imagined quite a lot of people getting on at Strassburg to go to Paris. But maybe in this he was wrong. In about half an hour, he thought, he ought to put on his topcoat and go and stand on the platform at the end of Marcangelo‚Äôs carriage and wait. And suppose Marcangelo used the loo at the other end of his carriage? There were loos at both ends. And suppose he didn‚Äôt go to the loo at all? That was possible, even though it wasn‚Äôt likely. And suppose the Italians simply didn‚Äôt choose to patronize the restaurant car? No, they would logically go to the restaurant car, but they‚Äôd go all together, too. If he couldn‚Äôt do anything, Reeves would simply have to make another plan, a better one, Jonathan thought. But Marcangelo, or someone comparable, would have to be killed, by him, if he was to collect any more money.

Just before 4 p.m., Jonathan forced himself to get up, to haul down his topcoat carefully. In the aisle, he put on the topcoat with its heavy right-hand pocket, and went with his paperback to stand on the platform at the end of Marcangelo‚Äôs carriage.





11


When Jonathan passed the Italians‚Äô compartment, not glancing in this time, he had seen out of the corner of his eye a confusion of figures, men pulling down a suitcase, or perhaps struggling playfully. He had heard laughter.

A minute later, Jonathan stood leaning against a metal-framed map of Central Europe, facing the half-glass door of the corridor. Through the glass, Jonathan saw a man approaching, bumping the door open. This man looked like one of Marcangelo‚Äôs bodyguards, dark-haired, in his thirties, with the sour expression and the sturdy build that ensured he would one day look like a disgruntled toad. Jonathan recalled the photographs on the jacket of The Grim Reapers. The man went straight to the WC door and entered. Jonathan continued to look at his open paperback. After a very short time, the man reappeared and went back into the corridor.

Jonathan found that he had been holding his breath. Suppose it had been Marcangelo, wouldn‚Äôt it have been a perfect opportunity, with no one passing from the carriage or the restaurant car? Jonathan realized he would‚Äôve stood just where he was, pretending to read, if it had been Marcangelo. Jonathan‚Äôs right hand, in his pocket, pushed the safety on and off the little gun. After all, what was the risk? What was the loss? Merely his own life.

Marcangelo might come lumbering forward at any minute, push the door open, and then‚Äî It could be like before, in the German underground. Couldn‚Äôt it? Then a bullet for himself. But Jonathan imagined firing at Marcangelo, then tossing the gun at once out the door by the WC, or out the door‚Äôs window which looked as if it opened, then walking casually into the restaurant car, sitting down and ordering something.

It was quite impossible.

I‚Äôll order something now, Jonathan thought, and went into the restaurant car, where there were plenty of free tables. On one side, the tables were for four people, on the other side for two. Jonathan took one of the smaller tables. A waiter came, Jonathan ordered a beer, then quickly changed it to wine.

‚ÄúWeisswein, bitte,‚Äù Jonathan said.

A cold quarter-bottle of Riesling appeared. The cluckety-cluck of the train sounded more muffled and luxurious here. The window was bigger, yet more private somehow, making the forest‚Äîthe Black Forest?‚Äîlook spectacularly rich and verdant. There were endless tall pines, as if Germany had so many it did not need to cut any down for any purpose. Not a scrap of debris or paper was to be seen, nor was any human figure to be seen caring for it, which was equally surprising to Jonathan. When did the Germans do their tidying? Jonathan tried to summon courage from the wine. Somewhere along the line he had lost his momentum, and it was just a matter of getting it back. He drank off the last of the wine as if it were an obligatory toast, paid his bill, and pulled on his coat, which he had laid on the chair opposite. He would stand on the platform until Marcangelo appeared, and whether Marcangelo was alone or with two bodyguards, he would shoot.

Jonathan tugged at the carriage door, sliding it open. He was back in the prison of the platform, leaning against the map again, looking at the stupid paperback. . . . David had wondered, did Elaine suspect? Desperate now, David went over the events of . . . Jonathan‚Äôs eyes moved over the print like an illiterate‚Äôs. He remembered something he‚Äôd thought of before, days ago. Simone would refuse the money, if she knew how he had got it, and of course she‚Äôd know how he had got it, if he shot himself on the train. He wondered if Simone could be persuaded by Reeves, by somebody, convinced‚Äîthat what he had done wasn‚Äôt exactly like murder. Jonathan almost laughed. It was quite hopeless. And what was he doing standing here? He could walk straight ahead now, back to his seat.

A figure was approaching, and Jonathan looked up. Then he blinked. The man coming toward him was Tom Ripley.

Ripley pushed open the half-glass door, smiling a little. ‚ÄúJonathan,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúGive me the thing, would you?‚Äî The garrote.‚Äù He stood sideways to Jonathan, looking out the window.

Jonathan felt suddenly blank with shock. Whose side was Tom Ripley on? Marcangelo‚Äôs? Then Jonathan started at the sight of three men approaching in the corridor.

Tom moved a bit closer to Jonathan to get out of their way.

The men were talking in German, and they went on into the restaurant car.

Tom said over his shoulder to Jonathan, ‚ÄúThe string. We‚Äôll give it a try, all right?‚Äù

Jonathan understood, or partly understood. Ripley was a friend of Reeves. He knew Reeves‚Äôs plan. Jonathan was wadding the garrote up in his left-hand trouser pocket. He pulled his hand out and gave the garrote into Tom‚Äôs willing hand. Jonathan looked away from Tom, and was aware of a sense of relief.

Tom pushed the garrote into the right-hand pocket of his jacket. ‚ÄúStay there, because I might need you.‚Äù Tom went over to the WC, saw it was empty, and went in.

Tom locked the toilet door. The garrote wasn‚Äôt even through its loop. Tom adjusted it for action, and put it carefully into the right-hand pocket of his jacket. He smiled a little. Jonathan had gone pale as a sheet! Tom had rung up Reeves the day before yesterday, and Reeves had told him Jonathan was coming but would probably hold out for a gun. Jonathan must have a gun now, Tom thought, but Tom considered a gun impossible in such conditions.

Stepping on the water pedal, Tom wet his hands, shook them, and passed his palms over his face. He was feeling a bit nervous himself. His first Mafia effort!

Tom had felt that Jonathan might botch this job, and having got Trevanny into this, Tom thought it behooved him to try to help him out. So Tom had flown to Salzburg yesterday, in order to board the train today. Tom had asked Reeves what Marcangelo looked like, but rather casually, and Tom didn‚Äôt think Reeves suspected that he was going to be on the train. On the contrary, Tom had told Reeves that he thought his scheme was harebrained, and had told Reeves that he might let Jonathan off with half the money and find someone else for the second job, if he wanted to make a success of it. But not Reeves. Reeves was like a small boy playing a game he had invented himself, a rather obsessive game with severe rules‚Äîfor other people. Tom wanted to help Trevanny, and what a great cause it was! Killing a big shot Mafioso! Maybe even two Mafiosi!

Tom hated the Mafia, hated their loan-sharking, their blackmail, their bloody church, their cowardliness in forever delegating their dirty work to underlings, so that the law couldn‚Äôt get its hands on the bigger bastards among them, never get them behind bars except on charges of income tax evasion or some other triviality. The Mafiosi made Tom feel almost virtuous by comparison. At this thought, Tom laughed out loud, a laugh which rang in the tiny metal-and-tile room in which he stood. (He was aware too that he just might be keeping Marcangelo himself waiting outside the door.) Yes, there were people more dishonest, more corrupt, decidedly more ruthless than himself, and these were the Mafiosi‚Äîthat charming, squabbling batch of families which the Italian-American League claimed did not exist, claimed were a figment of fiction-writers‚Äô imagination. Why, the church itself with its bishops making blood liquefy at the festival of San Gennaro, and little girls seeing visions of the Virgin Mary, all this was more real than the Mafia! Yes, indeed! Tom rinsed his mouth and spat and ran water into the basin and let it drain. Then he went out.

There was no one but Jonathan Trevanny on the platform, Jonathan now smoking a cigarette, but he at once dropped the cigarette like a soldier who wanted to appear more efficient under the eyes of a superior officer. Tom gave him a reassuring smile, and faced the side window by Jonathan.

‚ÄúDid they go by, by any chance?‚Äù Tom had not wanted to peer through the two doors into the restaurant car.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe may have to wait till after Strassburg, but I hope not.‚Äù

A woman was emerging from the restaurant car, having trouble with the doors, and Tom sprang to open the second for her.

‚ÄúDanke sch√∂n,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúBitte,‚Äù Tom replied.

Tom drifted to the other side of the platform and pulled a Herald-Tribune from a pocket of his jacket. It was now 5:11 p.m. They were to arrive at Strassburg at 6:33 p.m. Tom supposed the Italians had had a big lunch, and were not going to go into the restaurant car.

A man went into the lavatory.

Jonathan was looking down at his book, but Tom‚Äôs glance made Jonathan look at him, and Tom smiled once more. When the man came out, Tom moved over toward Jonathan. There were two men standing in the aisle of the carriage, several yards away, one smoking a cigar, both looking out the window and paying no attention to him and Jonathan.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to get him in the loo,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll have to have him out the door.‚Äù Tom jerked his head to indicate the door on the lavatory side. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm in the loo with him, knock twice on the door when the coast is clear. Then we‚Äôll give him the old heave-ho as fast as poss.‚Äù Very casually Tom lit a Gauloise, then slowly and deliberately yawned.

Jonathan‚Äôs panic, which had reached a peak when Tom had been in the WC, was subsiding a little. Tom wanted to go through with it. Just why he did was beyond Jonathan‚Äôs power to imagine just now. Jonathan also had a feeling that Tom might intend to botch the thing, and leave Jonathan holding the bag. And yet, why? More likely Tom Ripley wanted a cut of the money, maybe all the rest of it. At that moment, Jonathan simply didn‚Äôt care. It didn‚Äôt matter. Now Tom himself looked a bit worried, Jonathan thought. He was leaning against the wall opposite the WC door, newspaper in hand, but he wasn‚Äôt reading.

Then Jonathan saw two men approaching. The second man was Marcangelo. The first man was not one of the Italians. Jonathan glanced at Tom‚Äîwho at once looked at him‚Äîand Jonathan nodded once.

The first man looked around on the platform, saw the WC and made for it. Marcangelo passed in front of Jonathan, saw that the WC was occupied, and turned back and returned to the carriage aisle. Jonathan saw Tom grin and make a sweeping gesture with his right arm, as if to say, ‚ÄúDammit, the fish got away!‚Äù

Marcangelo was in plain view of Jonathan, waiting just a few feet away in the aisle, looking out the window. It occurred to Jonathan that Marcangelo‚Äôs guards, who were in the middle of the carriage, wouldn‚Äôt know that Marcangelo had had to wait, so that this extra time would arouse their anxiety sooner if Marcangelo didn‚Äôt come back. Jonathan nodded slightly at Tom, which he hoped Tom would understand to mean that Marcangelo was waiting nearby.

The man in the loo came out and returned to the carriage.

Now Marcangelo approached, and Jonathan gave a glance at Tom, but Tom was sunk in his newspaper.

Tom was aware that the dumpy figure entering the platform was Marcangelo again, but he did not look up from his newspaper. Just in front of Tom, Marcangelo opened the door of the WC, and Tom sprang forward like a person who was determined to get into the toilet first, but at the same time he flipped the garrote over the head of Marcangelo whose cry Tom hoped he stifled as he dragged him, with a jerk of the garrote like a boxer‚Äôs right cross, into the little room and closed the door. Tom yanked the garrote viciously‚Äîone of Marcangelo‚Äôs own weapons in his prime, Tom supposed‚Äîand Tom saw the nylon disappear in the flesh of his neck. Tom gave it another whirl behind the man‚Äôs head and pulled still tighter. With his left hand Tom flicked the lever that locked the door. Marcangelo‚Äôs gurgle stopped, his tongue began to protrude from the awful wet mouth, his eyes closed in misery, then opened in horror, and began to have the blank, what‚Äôs-happening-to-me stare of the dying. Lower false teeth clattered to the tiles. Tom was nearly cutting his own thumb and the side of his forefinger because of the force he was exerting on the string, but he felt it a pain worth enduring. Marcangelo had slumped to the floor, but the garrote, or rather Tom, was holding him in more or less a seated position. Marcangelo was now unconscious, Tom thought, and it was impossible for him to be breathing at all. Tom picked up the teeth, dropped them into the toilet, and managed to step on the pedal which dumped the pan. He wiped his fingers with disgust on Marcangelo‚Äôs padded shoulder.

Jonathan had seen the flick of the latch that changed the color from green to red. The silence was alarming to Jonathan. How long would it last? What was happening? How much time had passed? Jonathan kept glancing through the glass half of the door into the carriage.

A man came from the restaurant car, started for the toilet, and seeing that it was occupied, went on into the carriage.

Jonathan was thinking that Marcangelo‚Äôs friends would appear at any moment, if Marcangelo was in the least long in getting back to his compartment. Now the coast was clear, and was it time to knock? There must have been time for Marcangelo to die. Jonathan went and rapped twice on the door.

Tom stepped calmly out, closed the door and surveyed the situation, and a woman in a reddish tweed suit entered the platform just then‚Äîa smallish, middle-aged woman who was plainly headed for the toilet. The indicator was now showing green.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Tom said to her. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äîa friend of mine is being sick in there, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

‚ÄúBitte?‚Äù

‚ÄúMein Freund ist da drinnen ziemlich krank,‚Äù Tom said with an apologetic smile. ‚ÄúEntschuldigen Sie, gn√§dige Frau. Er kommt sofort heraus.‚Äù

She nodded and smiled, and went back into the carriage.

‚ÄúOkay, give me a hand!‚Äù Tom whispered to Jonathan, and started for the WC

‚ÄúAnother one‚Äôs coming,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúOne of the Italians.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Christ.‚Äù The Italian might simply wait on the platform, Tom thought, if he went into the loo and locked the door.

The Italian, a sallow chap of about thirty, gave Jonathan and Tom a look, saw that the lavatory said libre, then went into the restaurant car, no doubt to see if Marcangelo was there.

Tom said to Jonathan, ‚ÄúCan you bash him with the gun after I hit him?‚Äù

Jonathan nodded. The gun was small, but Jonathan‚Äôs adrenaline was at last stirring.

‚ÄúAs if your life depended on it,‚Äù Tom added. ‚ÄúMaybe it does.‚Äù

The bodyguard came back from the restaurant car, moving more quickly. Tom was on the Italian‚Äôs left, and pulled him by the shirtfront suddenly, out of view of the restaurant car‚Äôs doors, and hit him in the jaw. Tom followed this with a left fist in the man‚Äôs abdomen, and Jonathan cracked the Italian on the back of the head with the gun butt.

‚ÄúThe door!‚Äù Tom said, jerking his head, trying to catch the Italian who was falling forward.

The man was not unconscious, his arms flailed weakly, but Jonathan already had the side door open, and Tom‚Äôs instinct was to get him out without spending a second on another blow. The noise of the train wheels came with a sudden roar. They pushed, kicked, and poured the bodyguard out, and Tom lost his balance and would have toppled out, if not for Jonathan catching him by his jacket tails. Bang went the door shut again.

Jonathan pushed his fingers through his tousled hair.

Tom motioned for Jonathan to go to the other side of the platform, where he could see down the aisle. Jonathan went, and Tom could see him making an effort to collect himself and look like the ordinary passenger again.

Tom raised his eyebrows in a question, and Jonathan nodded, and Tom nipped into the WC and swung the latch, trusting that Jonathan would have the wit to knock again when it was safe. Marcangelo lay crumpled on the floor, head next to the basin pedestal, his face pale now with a touch of blue in it. Tom looked away from him, heard the rustle of doors outside‚Äîthe restaurant car doors‚Äîand then a welcome two knocks. This time Tom opened the door just a crack.

‚ÄúLooks all right,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Tom kicked the door open past Marcangelo‚Äôs shoes which the door bumped, and signaled for Jonathan to open the side door of the train. But in fact they worked together, Jonathan having to help Tom with some of Marcangelo‚Äôs weight before the side door was in a fully open position. The door tended to close because of the direction of the train. They tumbled Marcangelo through it headfirst, heels over head, and Tom, giving him a final kick, didn‚Äôt touch him at all, because his body had already fallen clear onto a cinder bank so close to Tom that he could see individual ashes and blades of grass. Now Tom held Jonathan‚Äôs right arm while Jonathan reached for the door‚Äôs lever and caught it.

Tom pulled the toilet door shut, breathless, trying to assume a calm air. ‚ÄúGo back to your seat and get off at Strassburg,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be looking at everyone on this train.‚Äù He gave Jonathan a nervous pat on the arm. ‚ÄúGood luck, my friend.‚Äù Tom watched Jonathan open the door that went into the carriage aisle.

Then Tom started to enter the restaurant car, but a party of four was coming out, and Tom had to step aside while they waddled, talked, and laughed through the two doors. Tom at last entered and took the first vacant table. He sat down in a chair facing the door he had just come through. He was expecting the second bodyguard at any moment. He drew the menu toward him and casually studied it. Coleslaw. Tongue salad. Gulaschsuppe . . . The menu was in French, English, and German.

Jonathan, walking down the aisle of Marcangelo‚Äôs carriage, came face to face with the second Italian bodyguard, who rudely bumped into him in getting past. Jonathan was glad he felt a bit dazed, otherwise he might have reacted with alarm at the physical contact. The train gave one whistle followed by two shorter ones. Did that mean something? Jonathan got back to his seat and sat down without removing his overcoat, careful not to glance at any of the four people in the compartment. His watch said 5:31 p.m. It seemed more than an hour since he had looked at his watch and it had been a couple of minutes past 5 p.m. Jonathan squirmed, closed his eyes, cleared his throat, imagining the bodyguard and Marcangelo, having rolled under the train wheels, being chewed into various bits. Or maybe they hadn‚Äôt rolled under. Was the bodyguard even dead? Maybe he‚Äôd be rescued and would describe him and Tom Ripley with accuracy. Why had Tom Ripley helped him? Or should he call it help? What did Ripley want out of it? He was now under Ripley‚Äôs thumb, he realized. Ripley probably wanted only money, however. Or was he due for worse? Some kind of blackmail? Blackmail had a lot of forms.

Should he try to get a plane from Strassburg to Paris tonight, or stay at a hotel in Strassburg? Which was safer? And safer from what, the Mafia or the police? Wouldn‚Äôt some passenger, looking out the window, have seen one body, maybe two, falling beside the train? Or had the two bodies fallen too close to the train to be seen? If anybody had seen anything, the train wouldn‚Äôt have stopped, but word could be radioed, Jonathan supposed. Jonathan was on the alert for a train guard in the aisle, for any sign of agitation, but he didn‚Äôt see any.

At that moment, having ordered Gulaschsuppe and a bottle of Carlsbad, Tom was looking at his newspaper, which he had propped against a mustard pot, and nibbling a crisp roll. And he was amused by the anxious Italian who had waited patiently outside the occupied loo, until to the Italian‚Äôs surprise a woman had emerged. Now the bodyguard was for the second time peering down the dining car through the two glass doors. And here he came, still trying to keep his cool, looking for his capo or his thug chum or both, walking the whole length of the car as if he might find Marcangelo sprawled under one of the tables or chatting with the chef at the other end of the car.

Tom had not lifted his eyes as the Italian came through, but Tom had felt his glance. Now Tom risked a look over his shoulder, such as a man who was expecting his food might give, and saw the bodyguard‚Äîa blondish, crinkly-haired type in a chalk-stripe suit, broad purple tie‚Äîtalking with a waiter at the back of the car. The busy waiter was shaking his head and pushing past him with his tray. The bodyguard bustled down the aisle between the tables again and went out.

Tom‚Äôs paprika-red soup arrived with the beer. Tom was hungry, as he had had only a small breakfast in his Salzburg hotel‚Äînot the Goldener Hirsch this time, because the staff knew him there. Tom had flown to Salzburg instead of Munich, not wanting to encounter Reeves and Jonathan Trevanny at the railway station. He‚Äôd had time in Salzburg to buy a green leather jacket with green felt trim for Heloise, which he intended to hide away until her birthday in October. He had told Heloise he was going to Paris for one night, maybe two, to see some art exhibits, and since Tom did this now and then, staying at the Inter-Continental or the Ritz or the Pont Royal, Heloise had not been surprised. Tom in fact varied his hotels, so that if he told Heloise he was in Paris when he wasn‚Äôt, she wouldn‚Äôt be alarmed at not finding him at, say, the Inter-Continental, if she telephoned. He had also bought his ticket at Orly, instead of at the travel agencies at Fontainebleau or Moret where he was known, and he had used his false passport provided by Reeves last year: Robert Fiedler Mackay, American, engineer, born in Salt Lake City, no wife. It had occurred to Tom that the Mafia could get the passenger list of the train with a bit of effort. Was he on the Mafia‚Äôs list of interesting people? Tom hesitated to attribute such an honor to himself, but some of Marcangelo‚Äôs family might have noticed his name in the newspapers. Not recruitable material, not promising as extortion victim either, but still a man on the borderline of the law.

But this Mafia bodyguard, or button man, hadn‚Äôt given Tom as long a look as he‚Äôd given a husky young man in a leather jacket across the aisle from Tom. Perhaps all was well.

Jonathan Trevanny would need some reassuring. Trevanny no doubt thought he wanted money, that he was intending to blackmail him somehow. Tom had to laugh a little (but he was still looking at his newspaper and might have been reading Art Buchwald) at the memory of Trevanny‚Äôs face when Tom had walked onto the platform, and at that funny moment when Trevanny had realized that he meant to help him. Tom had done some thinking in Villeperce, and decided to lend a hand with the nasty garroting, so that Jonathan could at least collect the money that had been promised. Tom was vaguely ashamed of himself, in fact, for having got Jonathan into it, and so coming to Jonathan‚Äôs aid relieved a bit of Tom‚Äôs guilt. Yes, if all went well, Trevanny would be a lucky and much happier man, Tom was thinking, and Tom believed in positive thinking. Don‚Äôt hope, think the best, and things would work out for the best, Tom felt. He would have to see Trevanny again to explain a few things, and above all Trevanny should take full credit for the Marcangelo murder in order to collect the rest of the money from Reeves. He and Trevanny mustn‚Äôt be seen to be chummy, that was a vital point. They mustn‚Äôt be chummy, at all. (Tom wondered now what was happening to Trevanny, if the second bodyguard was cruising the whole train?) The dear old Mafia would try to track the killer down, the killers maybe. The Mafia often took years, but they never gave up. Even if the man they wanted fled to South America, the Mafia might get him, Tom knew. But it seemed to Tom that Reeves Minot was in more danger than either himself or Trevanny at the moment.

He‚Äôd try to ring Trevanny tomorrow morning in his shop. Or tomorrow afternoon, in case Trevanny didn‚Äôt make it to Paris tonight. Tom lit a Gauloise and glanced at the woman in the reddish tweed suit, whom he and Trevanny had seen on the platform, who was now dreamily eating a dainty salad of lettuce and cucumber. Tom felt euphoric.

When Jonathan got off at Strassburg, he imagined that there were more police than usual in evidence, six perhaps instead of the usual two or three. One police officer seemed to be examining a man‚Äôs papers. Or had the man simply asked a direction, and the cop was consulting a guidebook? Jonathan walked straight out of the station with his suitcase. He had decided to stay the night in Strassburg, which, for no real reason, seemed a safer place than Paris tonight. The remaining bodyguard was probably going on to Paris to join his friends‚Äîunless by some chance the bodyguard was at this moment tailing him, ready to plug him in the back. Jonathan felt a light sweat breaking out, and he was suddenly aware of being tired. He set his suitcase down on a curb at a street intersection, and gazed around at unfamiliar buildings. The scene was busy with pedestrians and cars. It was 6:40 p.m., no doubt the Strassburg rush hour. Jonathan thought of registering under another name. If he wrote a false name plus a false card or identity number, no one would ask to see his real card. Then he realized that a false name would make him even more uneasy. Jonathan was becoming aware of what he had done. He suffered a brief nausea. Then he picked up his suitcase and trudged on. The gun weighed heavily in his overcoat pocket. He was afraid to drop it down a street drain, or into a rubbish bin. Jonathan saw himself getting all the way to Paris and into his own house with the little gun still in his pocket.

Tom, having left the green Renault station wagon near the Porte d‚ÄôItalie in Paris, got home to Belle Ombre a little before 1 a.m. Saturday. There was no light visible at the front of the house, but when Tom climbed the stairs with his suitcase, he was delighted to see that there was a light in Heloise‚Äôs room in the back left corner. He went in to see her.

‚ÄúBack finally! How was Paris? What did you do?‚Äù Heloise was in green silk pajamas with a pink satin eiderdown pulled up to her waist.

‚ÄúAh, I chose a bad film tonight.‚Äù Tom saw that the book she was reading was one he had bought, on the French socialist movement. That would not improve relations with her father, Tom thought. Often Heloise came out with very leftist remarks, principles which she had no idea of practicing. But Tom felt he was slowly pushing her to the left. Push with one hand, take with the other, Tom thought.

‚ÄúDid you see No√´lle?‚Äù Heloise asked.

‚ÄúNo. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was having a dinner party‚Äîtonight. I think. She needed one more man. Of course she invited us both, but I told her you were probably at the Ritz and to telephone you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was at the Crillon this time,‚Äù Tom said, pleasantly aware of the scent of Heloise‚Äôs cologne mingled with Nivea. And he was unpleasantly aware of his own filth after the train ride. ‚ÄúIs everything all right here?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery all right,‚Äù said Heloise in a manner that sounded seductive, though Tom knew she didn‚Äôt mean it that way. She meant she had had a happy and ordinary day and she was happy herself.

‚ÄúI feel like a shower. See you in ten minutes.‚Äù Tom went to his own room, where he had a real shower in the tub, not the telephone-type shower of Heloise‚Äôs bathroom.

A few minutes later‚ÄîHeloise‚Äôs Austrian jacket having been tucked away in a bottom drawer under sweaters‚ÄîTom was dozing in bed beside Heloise, too tired to look at L‚ÄôExpress any longer. He was wondering if L‚ÄôExpress might have a picture of one of the two Mafiosi, or both, beside the railway track in next week‚Äôs edition? Was that bodyguard dead? Tom devoutly hoped he had fallen under the rails somehow, because Tom was afraid he hadn‚Äôt been dead when they tossed him out. Tom recalled Jonathan pulling him back when he‚Äôd been about to fall out, and with his eyes closed Tom winced at the memory. Trevanny had saved his life, or at least saved him from an awful fall, and possibly from having a foot cut off by the train wheels.

Tom slept well, and got up around 8:30 a.m., before Heloise was awake. He had coffee downstairs in the living room, and in spite of his curiosity didn‚Äôt switch on the radio for the 9 a.m. news. He took a stroll around the garden, gazed with some pride at the strawberry patch which he had recently snipped and weeded, and stared at three burlap sacks of dahlia roots that had been kept over the winter and were due for planting. Tom was thinking of trying Trevanny by telephone this afternoon. The sooner he saw Trevanny, the better for Trevanny‚Äôs peace of mind. Tom wondered if Jonathan had also noticed the blondish bodyguard who had been in such a tizzy? Tom had passed him in an aisle when he had been making his way from the restaurant car back to his carriage, three carriages back, the bodyguard looking ready to explode with frustration, and Tom had had a great desire to say in his best gutter Italian, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get the sack if this kind of work keeps up, eh?‚Äù

Mme. Annette returned before 11 a.m. from her morning shopping and, hearing her close the side door into the kitchen, Tom went in to have a look at Le Parisien Liber√©.

‚ÄúThe horses,‚Äù Tom said with a smile, picking up the newspaper.

‚ÄúAh oui! You have a bet, M. Tome?‚Äù

Mme. Annette knew he didn‚Äôt bet. ‚ÄúNo, I want to see how a friend made out.‚Äù

Tom found what he was looking for at the bottom of page one, a short item about three inches long. Italian garroted. Another gravely wounded. The garroted man was identified as Vito Marcangelo, fifty-two, of Milan. Tom was more interested in the gravely wounded Filippo Turoli, thirty-one, who had also been pushed from the train and suffered multiple concussions, broken ribs, and a damaged arm that might require amputation in a hospital of Strassburg. Turoli was said to be in a coma and in critical condition. The report went on to say that a passenger had seen one body on the train embankment and alerted a train official, but not before kilometers had been covered by the luxurious Mozart Express, which had been going √† pleine vitesse toward Strassburg. Then two bodies had been discovered by the rescue team. It was estimated that four minutes had elapsed between the fall of each body, and police were actively pursuing their inquiries.

Obviously there would be more on the subject, with photographs probably, in later editions, Tom thought. That was a nice Gallic touch of detection, the four minutes, like a problem in arithmetic for children also, Tom thought. If a train is going at one hundred kilometers per hour, and one Mafioso is tossed out, and a second Mafioso is found tossed out six and two-thirds of a kilometer distant from the first Mafioso, how much time has elapsed between the tossing out of each Mafioso? Answer: four minutes. There was no mention of the second bodyguard who was evidently keeping his mouth shut and lodging no complaints about the service on the Mozart Express.

But the bodyguard Turoli wasn‚Äôt dead. And Tom realized that Turoli had perhaps had a look at him before Tom hit him in the jaw, had some idea of him. He might be able to describe him or identify him, if he ever saw Tom again. But Turoli had probably not taken in Jonathan at all, since Jonathan had hit him from behind.

Around 3:30 p.m., when Heloise had gone off to visit Agn√®s Grais on the other side of Villeperce, Tom looked up Trevanny‚Äôs shop number in Fontainebleau, and found that he had it correct in his memory.

Trevanny answered.

‚ÄúHello. This is Tom Ripley. Um-m‚Äîabout my picture.‚Äî Are you alone just now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you. I think it‚Äôs important. Can you meet me, say‚Äîafter you close today? Around seven? I can‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Trevanny sounded as tense as a cat.

‚ÄúSuppose I hold my car around the Salamandre bar? You know the bar I mean on the Rue Grande?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I know it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll drive somewhere and have a talk. Quarter to seven?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù said Trevanny as if through his teeth.

Trevanny was going to be pleasantly surprised, Tom thought as he hung up.

A little later that afternoon, when Tom was in his atelier, Heloise telephoned.

‚ÄúHello, Tome! I am not coming home, because Agn√®s and I are going to cook something wonderful and we want you to come. Antoine is here, you know. It‚Äôs Saturday! So come around seven-thirty, all right?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is eight, darling? I‚Äôm working a little.‚Äù

‚ÄúTu travailles?‚Äù

Tom smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sketching. I‚Äôll be there at eight.‚Äù

Antoine Grais was an architect with a wife and two small children. Tom looked forward to a pleasant, relaxing evening with his neighbors. He drove off for Fontainebleau early so that he could buy a plant‚Äîhe chose a camellia‚Äîas a present for the Grais, and give this as an excuse for being a little late, in case he was.

In Fontainebleau Tom also bought a France-Soir for the latest news about Turoli. There was nothing about any change in his condition, but the paper did say that the two Italians were believed to be members of the Genotti family of Mafia, and might have been victims of a rival gang. That at least would please Reeves, Tom thought, as that was Reeves‚Äôs objective. Tom found a vacant spot at the curb a few yards from the Salamandre. He looked through his back window and saw Trevanny walking toward him, in his rather slow stride, then Trevanny caught sight of Tom‚Äôs car. Trevanny was wearing a mac of impressive decrepitude.

‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Tom said, opening the door. ‚ÄúGet in and we‚Äôll go to Avon‚Äîor somewhere.‚Äù

Trevanny got in, barely mumbling a hello.

Avon was a twin town with Fontainebleau, though smaller. Tom drove down the slope toward the Fontainebleau-Avon railway station and bore to the right on the curve that led into Avon.

‚ÄúEverything all right?‚Äù Tom asked pleasantly.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Trevanny said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen the papers, I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat bodyguard isn‚Äôt dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Jonathan had imagined, since 8 a.m. that morning when he had seen the papers in Strassburg, that Turoli was going to come out of his coma at any moment and give a description of him and of Tom Ripley, the two men on the platform.

‚ÄúYou got back to Paris last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚ÄîI stayed in Strassburg and got a plane this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo trouble in Strassburg? No sign of that second bodyguard?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Tom was driving slowly, looking for a quiet spot. He slid up to a curb in a little street of two-story houses, stopped, and switched off his lights. ‚ÄúI think,‚Äù Tom said, pulling out his cigarettes, ‚Äúconsidering the papers haven‚Äôt reported clues‚Äînot the right ones anyway‚Äîwe did a rather good job. That comatose bodyguard is the only rub.‚Äù Tom offered Jonathan a cigarette, but Jonathan took his own. ‚ÄúHave you heard from Reeves?‚Äù Tom asked.

‚ÄúYes. This afternoon. Before you rang.‚Äù Reeves had rung this morning, and Simone had answered. Someone in Hamburg. An American, Simone had said. That was also making Jonathan nervous, simply the fact that Simone had spoken with Reeves, although Reeves hadn‚Äôt given his name.

‚ÄúI hope he‚Äôs not being sticky about the money,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI prodded him, you know. He ought to come up with all of it right away.‚Äù

And how much would you like, Jonathan wanted to ask, but decided to let Ripley get to it himself.

Tom smiled and slumped behind the wheel. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably thinking that I want some of the‚Äîforty thousand quid, isn‚Äôt it? But I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äî Frankly I was thinking you wanted some. Yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I wanted to see you today. One of the reasons. The other reason is to ask if you‚Äôre worried‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan‚Äôs tension was making Tom feel awkward, almost tongue-tied. He gave a laugh. ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôre worried! But there‚Äôre worries and worries. I might be able to help‚Äîthat is if you talk to me.‚Äù

What did he want, Jonathan wondered. He surely wanted something. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt quite understand, I suppose, why you were on the train.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it was a pleasure! A pleasure for me to eliminate, or help to eliminate such people as those two yesterday. Simple as that! Also a pleasure for me to help you put a little money in your pocket.‚Äî However, I meant worried about what we did‚Äîin any way. It‚Äôs hard for me to put into words. Maybe because I‚Äôm not at all worried. Not yet anyway.‚Äù

Jonathan felt off balance. Tom Ripley was being evasive‚Äîsomehow‚Äîor joking. Jonathan still felt a hostility toward Ripley, a wariness of him. And now it was too late. Yesterday on the train, seeing Ripley about to take over the job, Jonathan might have said, ‚ÄúAll right, it‚Äôs all yours,‚Äù and walked off, back to his seat. That would not have erased the Hamburg affair which Ripley knew about, but‚ÄîYesterday the money hadn‚Äôt been the motivation. Jonathan had simply been in a panic, even before Ripley had arrived. Now Jonathan felt he couldn‚Äôt find the right weapon for his defense. ‚ÄúI gather it was you,‚Äù Jonathan said, ‚Äúwho put out the story that I was on my last legs. You gave my name to Reeves.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Tom said a little contritely but firmly. ‚ÄúBut it was a choice, wasn‚Äôt it? You could‚Äôve said no to Reeves‚Äôs idea.‚Äù Tom waited, but Jonathan didn‚Äôt answer. ‚ÄúHowever, the situation is considerably better now, I trust. Isn‚Äôt it? I hope you‚Äôre not anywhere near dying, and you‚Äôve got quite a bit of dough‚Äîlolly, you‚Äôd call it.‚Äù

Jonathan saw Tom‚Äôs face light up with his innocent-looking American smile. No one, seeing Tom Ripley‚Äôs face now, would imagine that he could kill anyone, garrote someone, and yet he‚Äôd done just that about twenty-four hours ago. ‚ÄúYou have a habit of playing practical jokes?‚Äù Jonathan asked with a smile.

‚ÄúNo. No, certainly not. This might be the first time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you want‚Äînothing at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of anything I want from you. Not even friendship, because that‚Äôd be dangerous.‚Äù

Jonathan squirmed. He made himself stop drumming his fingers on a matchbox.

Tom could imagine what he was thinking, that he was under Tom Ripley‚Äôs thumb, in a way, whether Ripley wanted anything or not. Tom said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no more in my grip than I am in yours. I did the garroting, didn‚Äôt I? You could as well say something against me as I against you. Think of it that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd like to do, it‚Äôs protect you.‚Äù

Now Jonathan laughed and Ripley didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúOf course it may not be necessary. Let‚Äôs hope not. The trouble is always other people. Ha!‚Äù Tom stared through the windshield for an instant. ‚ÄúFor instance, your wife. What‚Äôve you told her about the money coming in?‚Äù

That was a problem, real, tangible and unsolved. ‚ÄúI said I was being paid something by the German doctors. That they‚Äôre making tests‚Äîusing me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù Tom said musingly, ‚Äúbut maybe we can think of something better. Because obviously you can‚Äôt account for the whole sum like that, and you both may as well enjoy it.‚Äî How about somebody dying in your family? In England? A recluse cousin, for instance.‚Äù

Jonathan smiled and glanced at Tom. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought of that, but frankly there isn‚Äôt anybody.‚Äù

Tom could see that Jonathan wasn‚Äôt in the habit of inventing. Tom could have invented something for Heloise, for example, if he‚Äôd suddenly come into a great deal of money. He would create an eccentric recluse tucked away in Santa Fe or Sausalito all these years, a third cousin of his mother‚Äôs, something like that, and embroider the personage with details remembered from a brief meeting in Boston when Tom had been a small boy, orphaned as Tom really had been. Little had he known that this cousin had a heart of gold. ‚ÄúStill it ought to be easy with your family so far away in England. We‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù Tom added, when he saw that Jonathan was about to say something in the negative. Tom looked at his watch. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm due for dinner, and I suppose you are too. Ah, one more thing, the gun. A small matter, but did you get rid of it?‚Äù

The gun was in the pocket of the raincoat Jonathan was wearing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it now. I‚Äôd very much like to get rid of it.‚Äù

Tom extended his hand. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have it. One thing out of the way.‚Äù Trevanny handed it to him, and Tom stuck it into the glove compartment. ‚ÄúNever used, so it‚Äôs not too dangerous, but I‚Äôll get rid of it because it‚Äôs Italian.‚Äù Tom paused for thought. There must be something else, and now was the time to think of it, because he did not intend to see Jonathan again. Then it came to him. ‚ÄúBy the way, I will assume that you tell Reeves you did this job alone. Reeves doesn‚Äôt know I was on the train. It‚Äôs much better that way.‚Äù

Jonathan had rather assumed the opposite, and took a moment to digest this. ‚ÄúI thought you were a rather good friend of Reeves.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre friendly. Not too. We keep a distance.‚Äù In a way Tom was thinking out loud, and also trying to say the right thing in order not to scare Trevanny, in order to make Trevanny feel more sure of himself. It was difficult. ‚ÄúNo one knows I was on that train but you. I bought my ticket under another name. In fact I was using a false passport. I realized you were having trouble with the garrote idea. I spoke with Reeves on the telephone.‚Äù Tom started his motor and put on the lights. ‚ÄúReeves is a bit cracked.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù

A motorcycle with a strong headlight came roaring round the corner and passed them, drowning out the car‚Äôs hum for a moment.

‚ÄúHe plays games,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs mainly a fence, as you may know, receives goods, passes them on. It‚Äôs as silly as spy games, but at least Reeves hasn‚Äôt been caught yet‚Äîcaught and released and all that. I understand he‚Äôs doing quite well in Hamburg, but I haven‚Äôt seen his place there.‚Äî He shouldn‚Äôt be dabbling in this sort of thing. Not his dish.‚Äù

Jonathan had been imagining Tom Ripley a frequent visitor at Reeves Minot‚Äôs place in Hamburg. He remembered Fritz turning up with a small package at Reeves‚Äôs that night. Jewelry? Dope? Jonathan watched the familiar viaduct, then the dark-green trees near the railway station come into view, their tops bright under the streetlights. Only Tom Ripley next to him was unfamiliar. Jonathan‚Äôs fear rose afresh. ‚ÄúIf I may ask‚Äîhow did you come to pick on me?‚Äù

Tom was just then making the difficult turn left at the top of the hill into the Avenue Franklin Roosevelt, and had to pause for oncoming traffic. ‚ÄúFor a petty reason, I‚Äôm sorry to say. That night in February at your party‚Äîyou said something I didn‚Äôt like.‚Äù Now Tom was clear of traffic. ‚ÄúYou said, ‚ÄòYes, I‚Äôve heard of you,‚Äô in a rather nasty way.‚Äù

Jonathan remembered. He also remembered he‚Äôd been feeling particularly tired and consequently bloody-minded that evening. So for a slight rudeness, Ripley had got him into the mess he was in now. Rather, he‚Äôd got himself into it, Jonathan reminded himself.

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have to see me again,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúThe job has been a success, I think, if we don‚Äôt hear anything from that bodyguard.‚Äù Should he say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù to Jonathan? To hell with it, Tom thought. ‚ÄúAnd from a moral point of view, I trust you don‚Äôt reproach yourself. Those men were murderers also. They often murder innocent people. So we took the law into our own hands. The Mafia would be the first to agree that people should take the law into their own hands. That‚Äôs their cornerstone.‚Äù Tom turned right into the Rue de France. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt take you all the way to your door.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny place here. Thanks very much.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to send a friend to pick up my picture.‚Äù Tom stopped his car.

Jonathan got out. ‚ÄúAs you like.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo ring me if you‚Äôre in straits,‚Äù Tom said with a smile.

At least Jonathan smiled back, as if he were amused.

Jonathan walked toward the Rue St. Merry, and in the next seconds began to feel better‚Äîrelieved. Much of his relief was due to the fact that Ripley didn‚Äôt seem to be worried‚Äînot by the bodyguard still alive, not by the fact they‚Äôd both stood for what seemed an unlikely length of time on that platform in the train. And the money situation‚Äîthat was as incredible as the rest of it.

Jonathan slowed his steps as he approached the Sherlock Holmes house, though he knew he was later than usual. The signature cards from the Swiss bank had come to his shop yesterday, Simone had not opened the letter, and Jonathan had signed the cards and put them into the post at once that afternoon. He had a four-figure number for his account which he had thought he would remember, but which he had already forgotten. Simone had accepted his second visit to Germany to see a specialist, but there wouldn‚Äôt be any more visits, and Jonathan would have to account for the money‚Äînot all of it but a good deal of extra money, for instance‚Äîby stories of injections, pills, and perhaps he‚Äôd have to make another trip or two to Germany just to substantiate his story that the doctors were continuing their tests. It was difficult, not at all Jonathan‚Äôs style. He was hoping that some better explanation might occur to him, but he knew it wouldn‚Äôt unless he racked his brains to think of one.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù Simone said as he came in. She was in the living room with Georges, picture books spread all over the sofa.

‚ÄúCustomers,‚Äù Jonathan said, and flung his mac on a hook. The absence of the gun‚Äôs weight was a relief. He smiled at his son. ‚ÄúAnd how are you, Pebble Boy? What‚Äôre you up to?‚Äù Jonathan spoke in English.

Georges grinned like a little blond pumpkin. One front tooth had vanished while Jonathan had been on the Munich trip. ‚ÄúI am weeding,‚Äù Georges said.

‚ÄúReading. You weed in the garden. Unless of course you have a speech defect.‚Äù

‚ÄúWot‚Äôs a peach defect?‚Äù

Worms, for example. But it could go on forever. What‚Äôs worms? A town in Germany. ‚ÄúSpeech defect‚Äîlike when you st-stutter. B-b-b√©gayer‚Äîthat‚Äôs a‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh Jon, look at this,‚Äù Simone said, reaching for a newspaper. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice it at lunch. Look. Two men‚Äîno, one man was killed on the train from Germany to Paris yesterday. Murdered and pushed off the train! Do you think that was the train you were on?‚Äù

Jonathan looked at the photograph of the dead man on the slope of ground, looked at the account of it as if he had not seen it before . . . garroted . . . an arm of the second victim may require amputation . . . ‚ÄúYes‚Äîthe Mozart Express. I didn‚Äôt notice anything on the train. But then there were about thirty carriages.‚Äù Jonathan had told Simone he had come in too late last night to make the last train to Fontainebleau, and that he had stayed at a small hotel in Paris.

‚ÄúThe Mafia,‚Äù Simone said, shaking her head. ‚ÄúThey must‚Äôve had a compartment with the blinds drawn to do that garroting. Ugh!‚Äù She got up to go to the kitchen.

Jonathan glanced at Georges, who was bent over an Ast√©rix picture book at that instant. Jonathan would not have wanted to explain what garroting meant.

That evening, though he felt a bit tense, Tom was in the best of spirits at the Grais‚Äô. Antoine and Agn√®s Grais lived in a round stone house with a turret, surrounded by climbing roses. Antoine was in his late thirties, neat and rather severe, master in his own house and tremendously ambitious. He worked in a modest studio in Paris all week, and came to the country at weekends to join his family, and knocked himself out further with gardening. Tom knew that Antoine considered him lazy, because if Tom‚Äôs garden was equally neat, what miracle was it, since Tom had nothing else to do all day? The spectacular dish that Agn√®s and Heloise had created was a lobster casserole with a great variety of seafood in the rice, and a choice of two sauces to go with it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought of a wonderful way to start a forest fire,‚Äù Tom said musingly when they were having coffee. ‚ÄúEspecially good down in the south of France, where there‚Äôre so many dry trees in summer. You fix a hand lens in a pine tree, you could do it even in winter, and then when the summer comes, the sun shines through it and the magnifying glass starts a little blaze in the pine needles. You place it near the house of somebody you dislike, of course and‚Äîsnap, crackle and pop!‚Äîthe whole thing goes up in blazes! The police or the insurance people wouldn‚Äôt very likely find the hand lens in all the charred wood and even if they did.‚Äî Perfect, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Antoine chuckled grudgingly, while the women gave appreciative shrieks of horror.

‚ÄúIf that happens to my property down South, I will know who did it!‚Äù said Antoine in his deep baritone.

The Grais owned a small property near Cannes which they let in July and August when rents were highest, and used themselves in the other summer months.

Mainly, however, Tom was thinking of Jonathan Trevanny. A stiff, repressed kind of fellow, but basically decent. He was going to need some more assistance‚ÄîTom hoped merely moral assistance.

Because of Vincent Turoli‚Äôs uncertain state, Tom drove to Fontainebleau on Sunday to buy the London papers, the Observer and the Sunday Times, which he usually bought from the Villeperce journaux-tabac on Monday morning. The news kiosk in Fontainebleau was in front of the H√¥tel de l‚ÄôAigle Noir. Tom glanced around for Trevanny, who probably bought the London Sundays habitually too, but he didn‚Äôt see him. It was 11 a.m., and perhaps Trevanny already had the papers. Tom got into his car and looked at the Observer first. It had nothing about the train incident. Tom wasn‚Äôt sure the English papers would bother reporting the story, but he looked into the Sunday Times and found an item on page three, one short column which Tom fell upon eagerly. The writer had given it a light touch: ‚Äú. . . It must have been an exceptionally fast Mafia job . . . Vincent Turoli of the Genotti family, one arm missing, one eye damaged, regained consciousness early on Saturday, and his condition is improving so rapidly he may soon be flown to a Milan hospital. But if he knows anything, he is not talking.‚Äù That was no news to Tom, that he wasn‚Äôt talking, but plainly he was going to live. That was unfortunate. Tom was thinking that Turoli had probably already given a description of him to his chums. Turoli would have been visited in Strassburg by family members. Important Mafiosi in the hospital were protected day and night by guards, and maybe Turoli would get this treatment too, Tom thought, as soon as the idea of eliminating Turoli crossed his mind. Tom recalled the Mafia-guarded hospitalization of Joe Colombo, head of the Profaci family, in New York. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Colombo denied that he was a member of the Mafia or that the Mafia existed. Nurses had had to step over the legs of bodyguards sleeping in the halls when Colombo had been in. Best not to think about getting rid of Turoli. He had probably already talked about a man in his thirties, with brown hair, a little over average height, who had socked him in the jaw and the stomach, and there must have been another man behind him too, because he had got a crack on the back of the head. The question was, would Turoli be absolutely sure if he spotted him again, and Tom thought there was a good chance of this. Oddly Turoli, if he had seen him, might recall Jonathan a little more clearly, simply because Jonathan didn‚Äôt look like everyone else, was taller and blonder than most people. Turoli of course would compare notes with the second bodyguard, who was alive and well.

‚ÄúDarling,‚Äù Heloise said when Tom walked into the living room, ‚Äúhow would you like to go on a cruise on the Nile?‚Äù

Tom‚Äôs thoughts were so far away, he had to think for a moment what the Nile was and where. Heloise was barefoot on the sofa, browsing in travel brochures. Periodically she received a slew of them from an agency in Moret, sent on the agency‚Äôs initiative, because Heloise was such a good customer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Egypt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt this look s√©duisant?‚Äù She showed Tom a picture of a little boat called the Isis which rather resembled a Mississippi steamboat, sailing past a ready shore.

‚ÄúYes. It does.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr somewhere else. If you don‚Äôt want to go anywhere, I will see how No√´lle feels,‚Äù she said, returning to the brochures.

Spring was stirring in Heloise‚Äôs blood. Tickling her feet. They had not been anywhere since just after Christmas, when they‚Äôd had a rather pleasant time on a yacht, sailing from Marseille to Portofino and back. The owners of the yacht, friends of No√´lle and rather elderly, had had a house in Portofino. Just now Tom didn‚Äôt want to go anywhere, but he didn‚Äôt say this to Heloise.

It was a quiet and pleasant Sunday, and Tom made two good preparatory sketches of Mme. Annette at her ironing board. She ironed in the kitchen on Sunday afternoons, watching her TV, which she wheeled into position against the cupboards. There was nothing more domestic, more French, Tom thought, than Mme. Annette‚Äôs sturdy little figure bent over her iron on a Sunday afternoon. He wanted to capture the spirit of this on canvas‚Äîthe very pale orange of the kitchen wall in sunlight, and delicate blue-lavender of a certain dress of Mme. Annette‚Äôs that set off so well her fine blue eyes.

Then the telephone rang just after 10 p.m., when Tom and Heloise were lying in front of the fireplace, looking at the Sunday papers. Tom answered.

It was Reeves, sounding extremely upset. The connection was bad.

‚ÄúCan you hold on? I‚Äôll try it from upstairs,‚Äù Tom said.

Reeves said he would, and Tom went running up the stairs, saying to Heloise, ‚ÄúReeves! A lousy connection!‚Äù Not that the telephone was necessarily better upstairs, but Tom wanted to be alone for this.

Reeves said, ‚ÄúI said my flat. In Hamburg. It was bombed today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? My God!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ringing you from Amsterdam.‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you hurt?‚Äù Tom asked.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Reeves shouted, his voice cracking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the miracle. I just happened to be out around 5 p.m. So was Gaby because she doesn‚Äôt work Sundays. These guys, they‚Äîmust‚Äôve tossed a bomb through the window. Quite a feat. The people below heard a car rush up and rush away after a minute, then two minutes later an awful explosion‚Äîwhich knocked all the pictures off their walls, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook‚Äîhow much are they on to?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought I better get elsewhere for my health. I was out of town in less than an hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did they find out?‚Äù Tom yelled into the telephone.

‚ÄúI dunno. I really dunno. They might‚Äôve got something out of Fritz, because Fritz failed to keep a date with me today. I sure hope old Fritz is okay. But he doesn‚Äôt know‚Äîyou know, our friend‚Äôs name. I always called him Paul when he was here. An Englishman, I said, so Fritz thinks he lives in England. I honestly think they‚Äôre doing this on suspicion, Tom. I think our plan has essentially worked.‚Äù

Good old optimistic Reeves, with his flat bombed, his possessions lost, his plan was a success. ‚ÄúListen, Reeves, what about‚ÄîWhat are you doing with your stuff in Hamburg? Your papers, for instance?‚Äù

‚ÄúStrongbox at the bank,‚Äù Reeves said promptly. ‚ÄúI can have those sent. Anyway, what papers? If you‚Äôre worried‚ÄîI just have one little address book and that‚Äôs always on me. I‚Äôm sure as hell sorry to lose a lot of records and paintings I‚Äôve got there, but the police said they‚Äôd protect everything they could. Naturally they questioned me‚Äînicely of course, for a few minutes, but I explained I was in a state of shock, damn near true, and I had to go somewhere for a while. They know where I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo the police suspect the Mafia?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt say so if they did. Tom old boy, I‚Äôll ring you again tomorrow maybe. Take my number, will you?‚Äù

Half reluctantly, though he realized he might need it for some reason, Tom took down Reeves‚Äôs hotel name, the Zuyder Zee, and its number.

‚ÄúOur mutual friend sure did one hell of a good job, even if that second bastard is still alive. For a fellow who‚Äôs anemic‚Äî‚Äù Reeves broke off with a laugh that was almost hysterical.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve paid him in full now?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid that yesterday,‚Äù said Reeves.

‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt need him anymore, I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. We‚Äôve got the police interested here. I mean in Hamburg. That‚Äôs what we wanted. I heard more Mafia have arrived. So that‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

Abruptly they were cut off. Tom felt a swift annoyance, a sense of stupidity, as he stood there with the buzzing, dead telephone in his hand. He hung up and stood in his room for a few seconds, wondering if Reeves would ring back, thinking he probably wouldn‚Äôt, trying to digest the news. From what Tom knew of the Mafia, he thought they might leave it at that, bombing Reeves‚Äôs flat. They might not be out for Reeves‚Äôs life. But evidently the Mafia knew that Reeves had had something to do with the killings, so the idea of creating the impression of rival Mafia gang war had failed. On the other hand, the Hamburg police would make an extra effort to clear the Mafia out of the town, out of private gambling clubs, too. Like everything Reeves did, or dabbled in, this situation was vague, Tom thought. The verdict ought to be: not quite successful.

The only happy fact was that Trevanny had his money. He should be informed of that by Tuesday or Wednesday. Good news from Switzerland!

The next days were quiet. No more telephone calls and no letter from Reeves Minot. Nothing in the newspapers about Vincent Turoli in the hospital at Strassburg or Milan, and Tom also bought the Paris Herald-Tribune and the London Daily Telegraph in Fontainebleau. Tom planted his dahlias, a three-hour job one afternoon, because he had them in smaller packages within the burlap bags, labeled for color, and he tried to plan his color patches as carefully as if he were imagining a canvas. Heloise spent three nights at Chantilly, where her parents had their home, because her mother was undergoing a minor operation for a tumor somewhere, which luckily turned out to be benign. Mme. Annette, thinking Tom was lonely, comforted him with American food which she had learned to prepare to please him: spareribs with barbecue sauce, clam chowder, and fried chicken. Tom wondered from time to time about his own safety. In the peaceful atmosphere of Villeperce, this sleepy, rather proper little village, and through the tall iron gates of Belle Ombre which appeared to guard the castle-like house but actually didn‚Äôt‚Äî

anyone might scale them‚Äîa murderer might arrive, Tom thought, one of the Mafia boys who would knock on the door or ring the bell, push past Mme. Annette, dash up the stairs, and plug Tom. It would take the police from Moret a good fifteen minutes to get here, probably, assuming Mme. Annette could telephone them at once. A neighbor hearing a shot or two might assume a hunter was trying his luck with owls, and probably wouldn‚Äôt attempt to investigate.

During the time that Heloise was in Chantilly, Tom decided to acquire a harpsichord for Belle Ombre‚Äîfor himself, too, of course and possibly for Heloise. Once, somewhere, he had heard her playing some simple ditty on a piano. Where? When? He suspected she was a victim of childhood lessons, and knowing her parents Tom assumed they had knocked any joy out of her endeavors. Anyway, a harpsichord might cost a goodly sum (it would be cheaper to buy it in London, of course, but not with the 100 percent tax the French would demand for bringing it in), but a harpsichord certainly came in the category of cultural acquisitions, so Tom did not reproach himself for the desire. A harpsichord was not a swimming pool. Tom telephoned an antique dealer in Paris whom he knew fairly well, and though the man dealt only in furniture, he was able to give Tom the name of a reliable place in Paris where he might buy a harpsichord.

Tom went up to Paris and spent a whole day listening to harpsichord lore from the dealer, looking at instruments, trying them out with timid chords, and making his decision. The gem he chose, of beige wood embellished with gold leaf here and there, cost more than ten thousand francs, and would be delivered on Wednesday, 26 April, along with the tuner who would at once have to get to work, because the instrument would have been disturbed by the move.

This purchase gave Tom a heady lift, made him feel invincible as he walked back to his Renault, impervious to the eye and maybe even the bullets of the Mafia.

And Belle Ombre had not been bombed. Villeperce‚Äôs tree-bordered, unpavemented streets looked as quiet as ever. No strange characters loitered. Heloise returned in a good mood on Friday, and there was the surprise for her for Tom to look forward to, the arrival of the large and delicately handled crate containing the harpsichord on Wednesday. It was going to be more fun than Christmas.

Tom did not tell Mme. Annette about the harpsichord either. But on Monday he said, ‚ÄúMme. Annette, I have a request. On Wednesday we have a special guest coming for lunch, maybe for dinner too. Let‚Äôs have something nice.‚Äù

Mme. Annette‚Äôs blue eyes lit up. She liked nothing better than extra effort, extra trouble, if it was in the cooking department. ‚ÄúUn vrai gourmet?‚Äù she asked hopefully.

‚ÄúI would think so,‚Äù Tom replied. ‚ÄúNow you reflect. I am not going to tell you what to prepare. Let it be a surprise for Mme. Heloise also.‚Äù

Mme. Annette smiled mischievously. One would have thought she had been given a present too.

The gyroscope Jonathan bought for Georges in Munich turned out to be the most appreciated toy Jonathan had ever given his son. Its magic remained, every time Georges pulled it from its square box where Jonathan insisted that he keep it.

‚ÄúCareful not to drop it!‚Äù Jonathan said, lying on his stomach on the living room floor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a delicate instrument.‚Äù

The gyroscope was forcing Georges to learn some new English words, because in his own absorption, Jonathan didn‚Äôt bother speaking French. The wonderful wheel spun on the tip of Georges‚Äô finger, or leaned sideways from the top of a plastic castle turret‚Äîthe latter a resurrected object from Georges‚Äô toy box, pressed into service instead of the Eiffel Tower shown on the pink page of instructions for the gyroscope.

‚ÄúA larger gyroscope,‚Äù Jonathan said, ‚Äúkeeps ships from rolling on the sea.‚Äù Jonathan did a fairly good job of explaining, and thought if he fixed the gyroscope inside a toy boat in a bathtub of tossing water, he might be able to illustrate what he meant. ‚ÄúBig ships have three gyroscopes going at once, for instance.‚Äù

‚ÄúJon, the sofa.‚Äù Simone was standing in the living room doorway. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell me what you think. Dark green?‚Äù

Jonathan rolled over on the floor, propped on his elbows. In his eyes the beautiful gyroscope still spun and kept its miraculous balance. Simone meant for the re-covering of the sofa. ‚ÄúWhat I think is that we should buy a new sofa,‚Äù Jonathan said, getting up. ‚ÄúI saw an advertisement today for a black Chesterfield for five thousand francs. I‚Äôll bet I can get the same thing for three thousand five hundred, if I look around.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree thousand five hundred new francs?‚Äù

Jonathan had known she would be shocked. ‚ÄúConsider it an investment. We can afford it.‚Äù Jonathan did know of an antique dealer some five kilometers out of town who dealt in nothing but large, well-restored pieces of furniture. Up to now he hadn‚Äôt been able to think of buying anything from this shop.

‚ÄúA Chesterfield would be magnificent‚Äîbut don‚Äôt go overboard, Jon. You‚Äôre on a spree!‚Äù

Jonathan had talked today about buying a television set, too. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt go on a spree,‚Äù he said calmly. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be such a fool.‚Äù

Simone beckoned him into the hall, as if she wanted to be out of Georges‚Äô hearing. Jonathan embraced her. Her hair got mussed against the hanging coats. She whispered in his ear:

‚ÄúAll right. But when is your next trip to Germany?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt like the idea of his trips. He had told her they were trying new pills, that Perrier was giving them to him, that though he might stay in the same condition, there was a chance the condition would improve, and certainly it wouldn‚Äôt get worse. Because of the money Jonathan said he was being paid, Simone didn‚Äôt believe that he wasn‚Äôt taking a risk of some kind. And even so, Jonathan hadn‚Äôt told her how much money, the sum now in the Swiss Bank Corporation in Z√ºrich. Simone knew only that there was six thousand francs or so in the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale in Fontainebleau, instead of their usual four to six hundred‚Äîwhich sometimes went down to two hundred, if they paid a mortgage installment.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love a new sofa. But are you sure it‚Äôs the best thing to buy now? At such a price? Don‚Äôt forget the mortgage.‚Äù

‚ÄúDarling, how could I?‚Äî Bloody mortgage!‚Äù He laughed. He wanted to pay off the mortgage at a whack. ‚ÄúAll right, I‚Äôll be careful. I promise.‚Äù

Jonathan knew he had to think of a better story, or elaborate on the story he‚Äôd already told. But for the moment he preferred to relax, to enjoy merely the thought of his new fortune‚Äîbecause spending any of it wasn‚Äôt easy. And he could still die within a month. The three dozen pills that Dr. Schroeder of Munich had given him, pills that Jonathan was now taking at the rate of two a day, were not going to save his life or wreak any great change. A sense of security might be a fantasy of sorts, but wasn‚Äôt it as real as anything else while it lasted? What else was there? What else was happiness but a mental attitude?

And there was the other unknown, the fact that the bodyguard called Turoli was still alive.

On 29 April, a Saturday evening, Jonathan and Simone went to a concert of Schubert and Mozart played by a string quartet at the Fontainebleau Theater. Jonathan had bought the most expensive tickets, and had wanted to take Georges, who could behave well if he were sufficiently cautioned beforehand, but Simone had been against it. She was more embarrassed than Jonathan, if Georges was not the model child. ‚ÄúIn another year, yes,‚Äù said Simone.

During the interval they went into the big foyer where one could smoke. It was full of familiar faces, among them Pierre Gauthier the art dealer, who to Jonathan‚Äôs surprise was sporting a wing collar and black tie.

‚ÄúYou are an embellishment of the music this evening, madame!‚Äù he said to Simone, with an admiring look at her Chinese red dress.

Simone acknowledged the compliment gracefully. She did look especially well and happy, Jonathan thought. Gauthier was alone. Jonathan suddenly remembered that his wife had died a few years ago, before Jonathan had really become acquainted with him.

‚ÄúAll of Fontainebleau is here tonight!‚Äù said Gauthier, making an effort to speak above the hubbub. His good eye roved over the scores of people in the domed hall, and his bald head shone under the gray-and-black hair he had carefully combed over it. ‚ÄúShall we have a coffee afterward? In the caf√© across the street?‚Äù Gauthier asked. ‚ÄúI shall be pleased to invite you.‚Äù

Simone and Jonathan were about to say yes, when Gauthier stiffened a little. Jonathan followed Gauthier‚Äôs glance and saw Tom Ripley in a group of four or five, only three yards away. Ripley‚Äôs eyes met Jonathan‚Äôs and he nodded. Ripley looked as if he might come over to say hello, and at the same time Gauthier sidled to the left, leaving. Simone turned her head to see who both Jonathan and Gauthier had been looking at.

‚ÄúTout √† l‚Äôheure, peut-√™tre!‚Äù said Gauthier.

Simone looked at Jonathan and her eyebrows went up a little.

Ripley stood out, not so much because he was rather tall as because he looked un-French with his brown hair touched with gold under the chandeliers‚Äô lights. He wore a plum-colored satin jacket. The striking blonde girl who seemed to be wearing no makeup at all must be his wife.

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù Simone said. ‚ÄúWho is that one?‚Äù

Jonathan knew she meant Ripley. Jonathan‚Äôs heart was beating faster. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve seen him before but I don‚Äôt know his name.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was at our house‚Äîthat man,‚Äù Simone said. ‚ÄúI remember him. Gauthier doesn‚Äôt like him?‚Äù

A bell rang, the signal for people to return to their seats.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause he seemed to want to get away!‚Äù Simone said, as if the fact was obvious.

The pleasure of the music had vanished for Jonathan. Where was Tom Ripley sitting? In one of the boxes? Jonathan did not look up at the boxes. Ripley might have been across the aisle from him, for all Jonathan knew. He realized that it wasn‚Äôt Ripley‚Äôs presence that had spoiled the evening, but Simone‚Äôs reaction. And Simone‚Äôs reaction had been caused, Jonathan knew also, by his own uneasiness at seeing Ripley. Jonathan deliberately tried to relax in his seat, propped his chin on his fingers, knowing all the while that his efforts were not deceiving Simone. Like a lot of other people, she had heard stories about Tom Ripley (even though at this moment she might not recall his name), and she was perhaps going to connect Tom Ripley with‚Äîwith what? At the moment, Jonathan really didn‚Äôt know. But he dreaded what would come. He reproached himself for having shown his nervousness so plainly, so na√Øvely. Jonathan realized he was in a mess, a very dangerous situation, and that he had to play it calmly, if he possibly could. He had to be an actor. A little different from his effort to succeed on the stage when he‚Äôd been younger. This situation was quite real. Or if one liked, quite phony. Jonathan had never before tried to be phony with Simone.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try to find Gauthier,‚Äù Jonathan said when they were moving up the aisle. The applause was still pattering around them, gathering itself into the coordinated palm-pounding of a French audience which wanted still another encore.

But somehow they didn‚Äôt find Gauthier. Jonathan missed Simone‚Äôs reply. She did not seem interested in finding Gauthier. They had the babysitter‚Äîa girl who lived in their street‚Äîat home with Georges. It was almost 11 p.m. Jonathan did not look for Tom Ripley and did not see him.

On Sunday, Jonathan and Simone had lunch in Nemours with Simone‚Äôs parents and her brother G√©rard and his wife. As usual, there was television after lunch, which Jonathan and G√©rard did not watch.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs excellent that the boches are subsidizing you for being one of their guinea pigs!‚Äù G√©rard said with one of his rare laughs. ‚ÄúThat is, if they don‚Äôt do you any harm.‚Äù He had come out with this in rapid slang, and it was the first thing he had said that really caught Jonathan‚Äôs attention.

They were both smoking cigars. Jonathan had bought a box at a tabac in Nemours. ‚ÄúYes. Lots of pills. Their idea is to attack with eight or ten drugs all at once. Confuse the enemy, you know. It also makes it more difficult for the enemy cells to become immune.‚Äù Jonathan rambled on quite well in this vein, half-convinced he was inventing it as he went along, half-recollecting it as a proposed method for combating leukemia that he had read about months ago. ‚ÄúOf course there‚Äôs no guarantee. There could be side effects, which is why they‚Äôre willing to pay me a bit of money for going through with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of side effects?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe‚Äîa decrease in blood-congealing level.‚Äù Jonathan was getting better and better at the meaningless phrases, and his attentive listener inspired him. ‚ÄúNausea‚Äînot that I‚Äôve noticed any so far. Then of course they don‚Äôt know all the side effects as yet. They‚Äôre running a risk. So am I.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if it succeeds? If they call it a success?‚Äù

‚ÄúA couple more years of life,‚Äù Jonathan said pleasantly.

On Monday morning, Jonathan and Simone drove with a neighbor, Ir√®ne Pliesse‚Äîthe woman who kept Georges every afternoon after school until Simone could fetch him‚Äîto the antique dealer on the outskirts of Fontainebleau where Jonathan thought he might find a sofa. Ir√®ne Pliesse was easygoing, large-boned, and had always struck Jonathan as rather masculine, though perhaps she wasn‚Äôt in the least. She was the mother of two small children and her house in Fontainebleau was more than commonly full of frilly doilies and organdy curtains. At any rate, she was generous with her time and her car, and had often volunteered to drive the Trevannys to Nemours on the Sundays when they went, but Simone with characteristic scrupulousness had never once accepted, because Nemours was a regular family affair. Therefore the pleasure of using Ir√®ne Pliesse‚Äôs services for the sofa-hunting was an unguilty one, and Ir√®ne took as much interest in the purchase as if the sofa was to be in her own home.

There was a choice of two Chesterfields, both with old frames and both recently covered in new black leather. Jonathan and Simone preferred the larger one, and Jonathan managed to knock the price down five hundred to three thousand francs. Jonathan knew it was a bargain, because he had seen the same-sized sofa advertised, with a picture of it, for five thousand. Now this vast sum, three thousand, nearly one month‚Äôs earnings of himself and Simone combined, seemed positively trifling. It was amazing, Jonathan thought, how quickly one could adjust to having a little money.

Even Ir√®ne, whose house looked opulent compared to the Trevannys‚Äô, was impressed by the sofa. And Jonathan noticed that Simone didn‚Äôt at once know what to say to pass it off smoothly.

‚ÄúJon had a little windfall from a relative in England. Not much but‚Äîwe wanted to get something really nice with it.‚Äù

Ir√®ne nodded.

All was well, Jonathan thought.

The next evening, before dinner, Simone said, ‚ÄúI dropped in to say hello to Gauthier today.‚Äù

Jonathan felt at once on guard, because of Simone‚Äôs tone of voice. He was drinking a scotch and water and looking at the evening paper. ‚ÄúOh, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúJon‚Äîwasn‚Äôt it this M. Ripley who told Gauthier that‚Äîthat you hadn‚Äôt long to live?‚Äù Simone spoke softly, though Georges was upstairs, probably in his room.

Had Gauthier admitted it, when Simone asked him a direct question? Jonathan didn‚Äôt know how Gauthier would behave, being asked a direct question‚Äîand Simone could be gently persistent until she got her answer. ‚ÄúGauthier told me,‚Äù Jonathan began, ‚Äúthat‚Äî Well, as I told you, he wouldn‚Äôt say who told him. So I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Simone looked at him. She was sitting on the handsome black Chesterfield sofa, which had since yesterday transformed their living room. It was due to Ripley, Jonathan was thinking, that Simone was sitting where she was. It didn‚Äôt help Jonathan‚Äôs state of mind.

‚ÄúGauthier told you it was Ripley?‚Äù Jonathan asked with an air of surprise.

‚ÄúOh, he wouldn‚Äôt say. But I simply asked him‚Äîwas it M. Ripley. I described Ripley, the man we saw at the concert. Gauthier knew whom I meant. You seem to know too‚Äîhis name.‚Äù Simone sipped her Cinzano.

Jonathan fancied her hand shook slightly. ‚ÄúIt could be, of course,‚Äù Jonathan said with a shrug. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, Gauthier told me whoever told him‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan gave a laugh. ‚ÄúAll this tale-bearing! Anyway Gauthier said, whoever it was‚Äîthe man said he could have been mistaken, that things get exaggerated.‚Äî Darling, it really is best forgotten. It‚Äôs silly to blame strangers. Silly to make too much out of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but‚Äî‚Äù Simone tilted her head. Her lips twisted somewhat bitterly, in a way Jonathan had seen only once or twice before. ‚ÄúThe curious thing is, it was Ripley. I know that. Not that Gauthier said it, no. He didn‚Äôt. But I could tell. . . . Jon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because‚ÄîRipley is very close to being a crook. Maybe he is a crook. Lots of crooks are not caught, you know. That is the reason I ask. I ask you. Are you‚ÄîAll this money, Jon‚Äî Are you getting it by any chance, somehow, from this M. Ripley?‚Äù

Jonathan made himself look straight at Simone. He felt that he had to protect what he already had, and it wasn‚Äôt so connected with Ripley that it would be a lie if he said it wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúHow could I? For what, darling?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust because he is a crook! Who knows for what? What has he got to do with these German doctors? Are they really doctors you are talking about?‚Äù She was beginning to sound hysterical. The color had risen to her cheeks.

Jonathan frowned. ‚ÄúDarling, Perrier has my two reports!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is something very dangerous about the tests, Jon, or they wouldn‚Äôt pay you so much, isn‚Äôt that true?‚Äî I have the feeling you‚Äôre not telling me the whole truth.‚Äù

Jonathan laughed a little. ‚ÄúWhat could Tom Ripley, that do-nothing‚Äî He‚Äôs an American, anyway. What could he have to do with German doctors?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou saw the German doctors because you were afraid you were going to die soon. And it was Ripley‚ÄîI am pretty sure‚Äîwho started the story you were going to die soon.‚Äù

Georges was bumping his way down the stairs, talking to some toy that he was dragging down. Georges in his dreamworld, but he was a presence, just a few yards away, and it rattled Jonathan. He found it incredible that Simone had discovered so much, and his impulse was to deny all of it, at any cost.

Simone was waiting for him to say something.

Jonathan said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who it was told Gauthier.‚Äù

Georges was standing at the door. Now his arrival was a relief for Jonathan. It effectively stopped the conversation. Georges was asking a question about a tree outside his window. Jonathan didn‚Äôt listen, and let Simone answer.

During dinner, Jonathan had the feeling Simone did not quite believe him, that she wanted to believe him, but couldn‚Äôt. Yet Simone (maybe because of Georges) was almost her usual self. She wasn‚Äôt sulking or cool. But the atmosphere for Jonathan was uncomfortable. And it was going to continue, he realized, unless he could come up with some more specific reason for extra money from the German hospitals. Jonathan hated the idea of lying, exaggerating the danger for himself in order to account for the money.

It even crossed Jonathan‚Äôs mind that Simone would speak to Tom Ripley himself. Mightn‚Äôt she telephone him? Make an appointment to see him? Jonathan dismissed that idea. Simone didn‚Äôt like Tom Ripley. She would not want to come anywhere near him.

That same week, Tom Ripley came into Jonathan‚Äôs shop. His picture had been ready for several days. Jonathan had a customer in his shop when Ripley arrived, and Ripley proceeded to look over some ready-made frames that leaned against a wall, obviously content to wait till Jonathan should be free. At last the customer left.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Tom said pleasantly. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt so easy after all to get someone to pick up my picture, so I thought I‚Äôd come myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, fine. It‚Äôs ready,‚Äù Jonathan said, and went to the back of his shop to get it. It was wrapped in brown paper, but the paper was not tied, and it was labeled RIPLEY, the label fastened with scotch tape to the paper. Jonathan carried it to his counter. ‚ÄúLike to see it?‚Äù

Tom was pleased with it. He held it at arm‚Äôs length. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. Very nice. What do I owe you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNinety francs.‚Äù

Tom pulled his billfold out. ‚ÄúIs everything all right?‚Äù

Jonathan was aware that he took a couple of breaths before he answered. ‚ÄúSince you ask‚Äî‚Äù He took the hundred-franc note with a polite nod, pulled out his cash drawer and got the change. ‚ÄúMy wife‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan looked at the door, and was glad to see that no one was approaching at the moment. ‚ÄúMy wife spoke to Gauthier. He didn‚Äôt tell her that you started that story about my‚Äîdemise. But my wife seems to have guessed it. I really don‚Äôt know how. Intuition.‚Äù

Tom had foreseen this happening. He was aware of his reputation, that many people mistrusted him, avoided him. Tom had often thought that his ego could have been shattered long ago‚Äîthe ego of the average person would have been shattered‚Äîexcept for the fact that people, once they got to know him, once they came to Belle Ombre and spent an evening, liked him and Heloise well enough, and the Ripleys were invited back. ‚ÄúAnd what did you say to your wife?‚Äù

Jonathan tried to speak quickly, because there might not be much time. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve said from the start, that Gauthier always refused to tell me who started the story. That‚Äôs true.‚Äù

Tom knew. Gauthier had gallantly refused to tell his name. Well, keep cool. If we don‚Äôt see each other‚Äî Sorry about the other night at the concert,‚Äù Tom added with a smile.

‚ÄúYes. But‚Äîit‚Äôs unfortunate. The worst is, she associates you‚Äîshe‚Äôs trying to‚Äîwith the money we‚Äôve got now. Not that I‚Äôve told her how much it is.‚Äù

Tom had thought of that too. It was irritating. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt bring you any more pictures to frame.‚Äù

A man with a large canvas on a stretcher was struggling through the door.

‚ÄúBon, m‚Äôsieur!‚Äù Tom said, waving his free hand. ‚ÄúMerci. Bonsoir.‚Äù

Tom went out. If Trevanny was seriously worried, Tom thought, Trevanny could telephone him. Tom had already said that at least once. It was unfortunate, troublesome for Trevanny, that his wife suspected that he had started the nasty rumor. On the other hand that wasn‚Äôt easily connected with money from hospitals in Hamburg and Munich, still less connected with the murder of two Mafiosi.

On Sunday morning, when Simone was hanging laundry on the garden line, and Jonathan and Georges were making a stone border, the doorbell rang.

It was one of their neighbors, a woman of about sixty whose name Jonathan wasn‚Äôt sure of‚ÄîDelattre? Delambre? She looked distressed.

‚ÄúExcuse me, M. Trevanny.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù said Jonathan.

‚ÄúIt is M. Gauthier. Have you heard the news?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was hit last night by a car. He is dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúDead?‚Äî Here in Fontainebleau?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was coming home around midnight from an evening with a friend, someone in the Rue de la Paroisse. You know M. Gauthier lives in the Rue de la R√©publique just off the Avenue Franklin Roosevelt. It was that crossroads with the little triangle of green where there is a traffic light. Someone saw the people who did it, two boys in a car. They didn‚Äôt stop. They went through a red light and hit M. Gauthier and didn‚Äôt stop!‚Äù

‚ÄúGood lord!‚Äî Won‚Äôt you sit down, Mme‚Äî‚Äù

Simone had come into the hall. ‚ÄúAh bonjour, Mme. Delattre!‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSimone, Gauthier is dead,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúRun over by a hit-and-run driver.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo boys,‚Äù said Mme. Delattre. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt stop!‚Äù

Simone gasped. ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù

‚ÄúLast night. He was dead when they got him to the hospital here. Around midnight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you come in and sit down, Mme. Delattre?‚Äù Simone asked.

‚ÄúNo, no, thank you. I must be off to see a friend. Mme. Mockers. I am not sure if she knows yet. We all knew him so well, you know?‚Äù She was near tears, and set her shopping basket down for a moment to wipe her eyes.

Simone pressed her hand. ‚ÄúThank you for coming to tell us, Mme. Delattre. That was kind of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe funeral is on Monday,‚Äù Mme. Delattre said. ‚ÄúAt St. Louis.‚Äù Then she departed.

The news somehow didn‚Äôt register on Jonathan. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her name?‚Äù

‚ÄúMme. Delattre. Her husband‚Äôs a plumber,‚Äù Simone said, as if, of course, Jonathan should know.

Delattre wasn‚Äôt the plumber they used. Gauthier dead. What would happen to his shop, Jonathan wondered. He found himself staring at Simone. They were standing in the narrow front hall.

‚ÄúDead,‚Äù Simone said. She put her hand out and gripped Jonathan‚Äôs wrist, not looking at him. ‚ÄúWe should go to the funeral on Monday, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù A Catholic funeral. It was all in French now, not Latin. He imagined all the neighbors, faces familiar and unfamiliar, in the cool church full of candles.

‚ÄúHit-and-run,‚Äù Simone said. She walked stiffly down the hall, and looked back over her shoulder at Jonathan. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really shocking.‚Äù

Jonathan followed her through the kitchen, out into the garden. It was good to get back into sunlight.

Simone had finished hanging her washing. She straightened some things on the line, then picked up the empty basket. ‚ÄúHit-and-run.‚Äî Do you really think so, Jon?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she said.‚Äù They were both talking softly. Jonathan still felt a bit dazed, but he knew what Simone was thinking.

She came a step closer, carrying the basket. Then she beckoned him toward the steps that led to the little porch, as if neighbors on the other side of the garden wall might hear them. ‚ÄúDo you think he could‚Äôve been killed purposely? By someone hired to kill him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause perhaps he knew something. That‚Äôs why. Isn‚Äôt it possible?‚Äî Why should an innocent person be struck down like that‚Äîaccidentally?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause‚Äîthese things happen sometimes,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Simone shook her head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think possibly that M. Ripley had something to do with it?‚Äù

Jonathan saw an irrational anger in her. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. I certainly don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù Jonathan could have bet his life that Tom Ripley hadn‚Äôt had anything to do with it. He started to say that, but it would‚Äôve sounded a bit strong‚Äîand if he wanted to look at it in another way, a rather comical bet.

Simone started to pass him and enter the house, but she stopped close to him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true Gauthier didn‚Äôt tell me anything definite, Jon, but he might have known something. I think he did.‚Äî I have the feeling he was killed on purpose.‚Äù

Simone was simply shocked, Jonathan thought, like himself. She was putting into words ideas that she hadn‚Äôt thought out. He followed her into the kitchen. ‚ÄúKnown something about what?‚Äù

Simone was putting the basket away in the corner cupboard. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just it. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù





15


The funeral service for Pierre Gauthier took place at 10 a.m. Monday in the church of St. Louis, the main church of Fontainebleau. The church was filled, and people stood even on the pavement outside where the two black automobiles waited dismally‚Äîone a shiny hearse, the other a boxlike bus to carry the family relations and friends who had no car of their own. Gauthier was a widower without children. He perhaps had a brother or sister, maybe therefore some nieces or nephews. Jonathan hoped so. The funeral seemed a lonely thing, despite all the people.

‚ÄúDo you know he lost his glass eye on the street?‚Äù a man next to Jonathan whispered to him in church. ‚ÄúIt fell out when he was hit.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Jonathan shook his head in sympathy. The man who had spoken to him was a shopkeeper. Jonathan knew his face, but could not connect him with any shop. Jonathan could see clearly Gauthier‚Äôs glass eye on the black tar road, maybe crushed by a car wheel by now, maybe found in the gutter by some curious children. What did the back of a glass eye look like?

Candles twinkled yellow-white, barely illuminating the church‚Äôs dreary gray walls. It was an overcast day. The priest intoned in French the formal phrases. Gauthier‚Äôs coffin stood short and thick in front of the altar. At least, if Gauthier had little family, he had many friends. Several women, a few men, were wiping away tears. And other people were murmuring to each other, as if their own exchanges could give them more comfort than the rote the priest was reciting.

There were some soft bells, like chimes.

Jonathan looked to his right, at the people in the rows of chairs across the aisle, and his eyes were caught by the profile of Tom Ripley. Ripley was looking straight ahead toward the priest who was speaking again, and he seemed to be following the ceremony with concentration. His face stood out among the faces of the French. Or did it? Was it merely because he knew Tom Ripley? Why had Ripley troubled to come? In the next instant Jonathan wondered if Tom Ripley might be putting on an act by coming? If, as Simone suspected, he really had had something to do with Gauthier‚Äôs death, even arranged it and paid for it?

When the people all stood up to file out of the church, Jonathan tried to avoid Tom Ripley, and he thought the best way to succeed in this was not to try to avoid him, above all not to glance another time in his direction. But on the steps in front of the church, Tom Ripley suddenly dashed up at one side of Jonathan and Simone and greeted them.

‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù Ripley said in French. He wore a black muffler around his neck, a dark-blue raincoat. ‚ÄúBonjour, madame. I‚Äôm glad to see you both. You were friends of M. Gauthier, I think.‚Äù

They were all walking slowly down the steps, because of the dense crowd, so slowly it was hard to keep one‚Äôs balance.

‚ÄúOui,‚Äù Jonathan replied. ‚ÄúHe was one of our neighborhood shopkeepers, you know. A very nice man.‚Äù

Tom nodded. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen the papers this morning. A friend in Moret rang me‚Äîand told me. Have the police any idea who did it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúJust ‚Äòtwo boys.‚Äô Did you hear anything else, Simone?‚Äù

Simone shook her head which was covered in a dark scarf. ‚ÄúNo. Not a thing.‚Äù

Tom nodded. ‚ÄúI was hoping you might‚Äôve heard something‚Äîliving closer than I do.‚Äù

Tom Ripley seemed genuinely concerned, Jonathan thought, not just putting on a show for them.

‚ÄúI must buy a paper.‚Äî Are you going to the cemetery?‚Äù Tom asked.

‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre not,‚Äù said Jonathan.

Tom nodded. They had all now reached the pavement level. ‚ÄúNor am I. I‚Äôll miss old Gauthier. It‚Äôs too bad.‚Äî Very nice to have seen you.‚Äù With a quick smile, Ripley went away.

Jonathan and Simone walked on, around the corner of the church into the Rue de la Paroisse, the direction of their house. Neighbors nodded to them, gave them brief smiles, and some said, ‚ÄúGood morning, Madame, M‚Äôsieur,‚Äù in a way they wouldn‚Äôt have done on ordinary mornings. Car motors started up, ready to follow the hearse to the cemetery‚Äîwhich Jonathan recalled was just behind the Fontainebleau Hospital where he had so often gone for transfusions.

‚ÄúBonjour, M. Trevanny! Et Madame!‚Äù It was Dr. Perrier, sprightly as ever, and almost as beaming as usual. He pumped Jonathan‚Äôs hand, at the same time making a small bow to Simone. ‚ÄúWhat a dreadful thing, eh? . . . No, no, no, no, they haven‚Äôt found the boys at all. But someone said it was a Paris license on the car. A black D.S. That‚Äôs all they know . . . And how are you feeling, M. Trevanny?‚Äù Dr. Perrier‚Äôs smile was confident.

‚ÄúAbout the same,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúNo complaints.‚Äù He was glad that Dr. Perrier took off at once, because Jonathan was aware that Simone knew he was supposed to be seeing Dr. Perrier rather frequently now for pills and injections, though he hadn‚Äôt been to Perrier since at least a fortnight, when he had delivered Dr. Schroeder‚Äôs report that had come to him at his shop.

‚ÄúWe must buy a paper,‚Äù said Simone.

‚ÄúUp at the corner,‚Äù Jonathan said.

They bought a paper, and Jonathan stood on a pavement still a bit crowded with people dispersing from Gauthier‚Äôs service, and read about ‚Äúthe disgraceful and wanton act of young hoodlums‚Äù which had taken place late Saturday evening in a street of Fontainebleau. Simone looked over his shoulder. The weekend paper had not had time to print the story, so this was the first account they had seen. Someone had seen a large, dark car with at least two young men in it, but no mention was made of a Paris license number. The car had gone on in the direction of Paris, but had vanished by the time police tried to give pursuit.

‚ÄúIt is shocking,‚Äù said Simone. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt often, you know, that there are hit-and-run drivers in France . . .‚Äù

Jonathan detected a note of chauvinism.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes me suspect‚Äî‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúOf course I could be completely wrong. But it is quite in character if this type Ripley makes an appearance at M. Gauthier‚Äôs funeral service!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan stopped. He had been going to say that Tom Ripley had certainly seemed concerned that morning, and also that he bought his art supplies at Gauthier‚Äôs shop, but Jonathan realized that he was not supposed to know this. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by ‚Äòin character‚Äô?‚Äù

Simone shrugged again, and Jonathan knew she was in a mood in which she might refuse to say another word on the subject. ‚ÄúI think it is just possible this Ripley found out from M. Gauthier that I spoke with him, asking him who started this story about you. I told you I thought it was Ripley, even though M. Gauthier wouldn‚Äôt say so. And now‚Äîthis‚Äîthe very mysterious death of M. Gauthier.‚Äù

Jonathan was silent. They were nearing the Rue St. Merry. ‚ÄúBut that story, darling‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt possibly be worth killing a man for. Be reasonable.‚Äù

Simone suddenly remembered they needed something for lunch. She went into a charcuterie, and Jonathan waited on the pavement. For a few seconds Jonathan realized‚Äîin a different way, as if he saw it through Simone‚Äôs eyes‚Äîwhat he had done in killing one man by gunshot, and by helping to kill another. Jonathan had rationalized it by telling himself that the two men had been gunmen themselves, murderers. Simone, of course, wouldn‚Äôt see it that way. They were human life, after all. Simone was sufficiently upset because Tom Ripley might have hired someone to kill Gauthier‚Äîjust might have. If she knew that her own husband had pulled a trigger‚ÄîOr was he influenced at the moment by the funeral ser-vice he had just been to? The service had after all been about the sanctity of human life, despite saying that the next world was even better. Jonathan smiled ironically. It was the word sanctity‚Äî

Simone came out of the charcuterie, awkwardly holding little packages, because she hadn‚Äôt her shopping net with her. Jonathan took a couple of them. They walked on.

Sanctity. Jonathan had given the Mafia book back to Reeves. If he ever had serious qualms about what he had done, all he needed to do was remember some of the murderers he had read about.

Nevertheless, Jonathan felt apprehensive as he climbed the steps of the house behind Simone. It was because Simone was now so hostile toward Ripley. Simone hadn‚Äôt cared for Pierre Gauthier all this much, to be so affected by his death. Her attitude was composed of a sixth sense, conventional morality and wifely protectiveness. She believed that Ripley had started the story about his dying soon, and Jonathan foresaw that nothing would shake her, because no other person could easily be substituted as a source of the story, especially now that Gauthier was dead, and couldn‚Äôt back Jonathan up if he tried to invent another person.

TOM SHED HIS BLACK MUFFLER in his car, and drove southward toward Moret and home. It was a pity about Simone‚Äôs hostility, that Simone suspected he had arranged Gauthier‚Äôs death. Tom lit a cigarette with the lighter from his dashboard. He was in the red Alfa-Romeo, and felt tempted to go fast, but he held his speed back prudently.

Gauthier‚Äôs death had been an accident, Tom was sure. A nasty, unfortunate thing, but still an accident, unless Gauthier was mixed up in stranger things than Tom knew about.

A big magpie swooped across the road, beautiful against a background of a pale-green weeping willow. The sun had begun to come out. Tom thought of stopping in Moret to buy something‚Äîthere seemed always something that Mme. Annette needed or might like‚Äîbut today he couldn‚Äôt recall anything that she‚Äôd asked for, and he didn‚Äôt really feel like stopping. It was his usual framer in Moret who had rung him yesterday to tell him about Gauthier. Tom must have mentioned to him at some point that he bought his paints at Gauthier‚Äôs in Fontainebleau. Tom let his foot down on the accelerator and passed a truck, then two speeding Citro√´ns, and soon he was at the turnoff to Villeperce.

‚ÄúAh, Tome, you had a long-distance telephone call,‚Äù Heloise said when he came into the living room.

‚ÄúFrom where?‚Äù But Tom knew. It was probably Reeves.

‚ÄúGermany, I think.‚Äù Heloise went back to the harpsichord, which now had a place of honor near the French windows.

Tom recognized a Bach chaconne whose treble she was reading. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll ring back?‚Äù he asked.

Heloise turned her head and her long blonde hair swung out. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, ch√©ri. It was only the operator I spoke to, because they wanted person-to-person. There it is!‚Äù she said as the telephone rang on her last words.

Tom dashed upstairs to his room.

The operator ascertained that he was M. Ripley, then Reeves‚Äôs voice said:

‚ÄúHello, Tom. Can you talk?‚Äù Reeves sounded calmer than the last time.

‚ÄúYes. You‚Äôre in Amsterdam?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and I have a little news you won‚Äôt find in the newspaper that I thought you might like to hear. That bodyguard died. You know, the one they took to Milan.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho said he died?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I heard it from one of my friends in Hamburg. A usually reliable friend.‚Äù

It was the kind of story the Mafia might put out, Tom thought. He would believe it when he saw the corpse. ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought it might be good news for our mutual friend, that this guy is dead. You know.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. I do understand, Reeves. And how are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, still alive.‚Äù Reeves forced the sound of a laugh.

‚ÄúAlso I‚Äôm arranging for my things to be sent to Amsterdam. I like it here. I feel much safer than in Hamburg, I can tell you that. Oh, there is one thing. My friend Fritz. He telephoned me, got my number from Gaby. He‚Äôs now with his cousin in some little town near Hamburg. But he got beaten up, lost a couple of teeth, poor guy. Those swine beat him up for what they could get out of him . . .‚Äù

That was close to home, Tom thought, and felt a pang of sympathy for this unknown Fritz‚ÄîReeves‚Äôs driver, or package-runner.

‚ÄúFritz never knew our friend as anything else but ‚ÄòPaul‚Äô‚Äù Reeves went on. ‚ÄúAlso Fritz gave them an opposite description, black hair, short and plump, but I‚Äôm afraid they might not believe him. Fritz did pretty well, considering he was getting the treatment. He said he stuck to his story‚Äîthe way our friend looks, and that‚Äôs all he knows about him. I‚Äôm the one in a mess, I think.‚Äù

That was certainly true, Tom thought, because the Italians knew what Reeves looked like, all right. ‚ÄúVery interesting news. I don‚Äôt think we should talk all day, my friend. What‚Äôre you really worried about?‚Äù

Reeves‚Äôs sigh was audible. ‚ÄúGetting my things here. But I sent Gaby some money, and she‚Äôs going to get things shipped. I‚Äôve written my bank and all that. I‚Äôm even growing a beard. And of course I‚Äôm using a‚Äîanother name.‚Äù

Tom had supposed Reeves would be using another name, with one of his false passports. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúAndrew Lucas‚Äîof Virginia,‚Äù Reeves said, with a ‚ÄúHah‚Äù by way of a laugh. ‚ÄúBy the way, have you seen our mutual friend?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Why should I?‚Äî Well, Andy, let me know how things go.‚Äù Tom was sure Reeves would ring if he were in trouble, if it was the kind of trouble in which he was still able to ring, because Reeves thought Tom Ripley could pull him out of anything. But mainly for Trevanny‚Äôs sake, Tom wanted to know if Reeves was in trouble.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do that, Tom. Oh, one more thing! A Di Stefano man was plugged in Hamburg! Saturday night. You might see it in the papers and you might not. But the Genotti family must‚Äôve got him. That‚Äôs what we wanted . . .‚Äù

Reeves at last signed off.

If the Mafia got to Reeves in Amsterdam, Tom was thinking, they‚Äôd torture some facts out of him. Tom doubted if Reeves could stand up as well as Fritz apparently had done. Tom wondered which family, the Di Stefanos or the Genottis, had got hold of Fritz? Fritz probably knew only about the first operation, the shooting in Hamburg. That victim had been merely a button man. The Genottis would be far more livid: they had lost a capo, and, it was said now, a button man or bodyguard. Didn‚Äôt both families know by now that the murders had started with Reeves and the Hamburg casino boys, and not through family warfare? Were they finished with Reeves? Tom felt quite incapable of protecting Reeves, if he should need protection. If it was only one man they were up against, how easy it would be! But the Mafia were beyond count.

Reeves had said at the last that he had been ringing from a post office. That was at least safer than if he had rung from his hotel. Tom was thinking about Reeves‚Äôs first call. Hadn‚Äôt that been from the hotel called the Zuyder Zee? Tom thought so.

Harpsichord notes came purely from below stairs, a message from another century. Tom went down the stairs. Heloise would want him to tell her about the funeral service, say something about it, though when he had asked her if she wanted to go with him, she had said that funeral services depressed her.

JONATHAN STOOD IN HIS LIVING ROOM, gazing out the front window. It was just after twelve noon. He had turned on the portable radio for the noonday news, and now it was playing pop music. Simone was in the garden with Georges, who had stayed in the house alone while he and Simone went to the funeral service. On the radio a man‚Äôs voice sang ‚Äúrunnin‚Äô on along . . . runnin‚Äô on along . . .‚Äù and Jonathan watched a young dog that looked like an Alsatian loping after two small boys on the opposite pavement. Jonathan had a sense of the temporariness of everything, of life of all kinds‚Äînot only of the dog and the two boys, but of the houses behind them, a sense that everything would perish, crumble finally, shapes destroyed and even forgotten. Jonathan thought of Gauthier in his coffin being lowered into the ground perhaps at this moment, and then he didn‚Äôt think about Gauthier again but about himself. He hadn‚Äôt the energy of the dog that had trotted past. If he‚Äôd had any prime, he felt past it. It was too late, and Jonathan felt that he hadn‚Äôt the energy to enjoy what was left of his life, now that he had a little wherewithal to enjoy it. He ought to close up his shop, sell it or give it away, what did it matter? Yet on second thought he couldn‚Äôt simply squander the money with Simone, because what would she and Georges have when he died? Forty thousand quid wasn‚Äôt a fortune. His ears were ringing. Calmly Jonathan took deep, slow breaths. He made an effort to raise the window in front of him, and found he hadn‚Äôt the strength. He turned to face the center of the room, his legs heavy and nearly uncontrollable. The ringing in his ears had completely drowned the music.

He came to, sweating and cool, on the living room floor. Simone was on her knees beside him, lightly passing a damp towel across his forehead, down his face.

‚ÄúDarling, I just found you! How are you?‚Äî Georges, it is all right. Papa is all right!‚Äù But Simone sounded frightened.

Jonathan put his head down again on the carpet.

‚ÄúSome water?‚Äù

Jonathan managed to sip from the glass she held. He lay back again. ‚ÄúI think I might have to lie here all afternoon!‚Äù His voice warred with the ringing in his ears.

‚ÄúLet me straighten this.‚Äù Simone pulled at his jacket which was bunched under him.

Something slipped out of a pocket. He saw Simone pick up something, then she looked back at him with concern, and Jonathan kept his eyes open, focusing on the ceiling, because things were worse if he closed his eyes. Minutes passed, minutes of silence. Jonathan was not worried, because he knew he would hang on, that this wasn‚Äôt death, merely a faint. Maybe first cousin to death, but death wouldn‚Äôt come quite like this. Death would probably have a sweeter, more seductive pull, like a wave sweeping out from a shore, sucking hard at the legs of a swimmer who‚Äôd already ventured too far, and who mysteriously had lost his will to struggle. Simone went away, urging Georges out with her, then returned with a cup of hot tea.

‚ÄúThis has a lot of sugar. It will do you good. Do you want me to telephone Dr. Perrier?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, darling. Thanks.‚Äù After some sips of the tea, Jonathan got himself to the sofa and sat down.

‚ÄúJon, what‚Äôs this?‚Äù Simone asked, holding up the little blue book that was the Swiss bank‚Äôs passbook.

‚ÄúOh‚Äîthat‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan shook his head, trying to make himself more alert.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bankbook. Isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Äîyes.‚Äù The sum was in six figures, more than four hundred thousand francs, which were indicated by an ‚Äúf‚Äù after them. He also knew that Simone had looked into the little book in all innocence, assuming it was a record of some household purchase, some kind of record they had in common.

‚ÄúIt says francs. French francs?‚Äî Where did you get it? What is it, Jon?‚Äù

The sum was in French francs. ‚ÄúDarling, that‚Äôs sort of an advance‚Äîfrom the German doctors.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù Simone looked at a loss. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs French francs, isn‚Äôt it? This sum!‚Äù She laughed a little, nervously.

Jonathan‚Äôs face was suddenly warm. ‚ÄúI told you where I got it, Simone. Naturally‚ÄîI know it‚Äôs a biggish sum. I didn‚Äôt want to tell you at once. I‚Äî‚Äù

Simone laid the little blue book carefully on top of his wallet on the low table in front of the sofa. Then she pulled the chair from in front of the writing table and sat down on it, sideways, holding to its back with one hand. ‚ÄúJon‚Äî‚Äù

Georges suddenly appeared in the hall doorway, and Simone got up with determination and turned him by the shoulders. ‚ÄúChou-chou, papa and I are talking. Now leave us alone for a minute.‚Äù She came back and said quietly, ‚ÄúJon, I don‚Äôt believe you.‚Äù

Jonathan heard a trembling in her voice. It wasn‚Äôt only the sum of money, startling though it was, but also his secrecy lately‚Äîthe trips to Germany. ‚ÄúWell‚Äîyou‚Äôve got to believe me,‚Äù Jonathan said. Some strength had returned. He stood up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an advance. They don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to use it. I won‚Äôt have time. But you can.‚Äù

Simone did not respond to his laugh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in your name. ‚ÄîJon, whatever you are doing, you are not telling me the truth.‚Äù And she waited, just those few seconds when he might have told her the truth, but he didn‚Äôt speak.

Simone left the room.

And lunch was a sort of duty. They barely talked. Jonathan could see that Georges was puzzled. Jonathan could foresee the days ahead‚ÄîSimone perhaps not questioning him again, just coolly waiting for him to tell the truth, or to explain‚Äîsomehow. Long silences in the house, no more lovemaking, no more affection or laughter. He had to come up with something else, something better. Even if he said he ran the risk of dying under the German doctors‚Äô treatment, was it logical that they‚Äôd paid him this much? Not really. Jonathan realized that his life wasn‚Äôt worth as much as the lives of two Mafiosi.





16


Friday morning was lovely with light rain alternating with sunlight every half hour or so, just the thing for the garden, Tom thought. Heloise had driven up to Paris, because there was a dress sale at a certain boutique in the Faubourg St. Honor√©, and Tom felt sure she would come back also with a scarf or something more important from Herm√®s as well. Tom sat at the harpsichord, playing the base of a Goldberg variation, trying to get the fingering in his head and in his hand. He had bought a few music books in Paris the same day he had acquired the harpsichord. Tom knew how the variation should sound, because he had Landowska‚Äôs recording. As he was going over it for the third or fourth time and feeling that he had made progress, the telephone jangled.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù said Tom.

‚Äú‚ÄôEllo‚Äîah‚Äîto whom am I speaking, please?‚Äù a man‚Äôs voice asked in French.

Tom, more slowly than usual, felt an unease. ‚ÄúYou wished to speak to whom?‚Äù he asked with equal politeness.

‚ÄúM. Anquetin?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, this is not his house,‚Äù said Tom, and put the telephone back in its cradle.

The man‚Äôs accent had been perfect‚Äîhadn‚Äôt it? But then the Italians would get a Frenchman to make the call, or an Italian whose French accent was perfect. Or was he overanxious? Frowning, Tom turned to face the harpsichord and the windows, and shoved his hands into his back pockets. Had the Genotti family found Reeves in his hotel, and were they checking all the telephone numbers Reeves had called? If so, this caller wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied with his answer. An ordinary person would have said, ‚ÄúYou are mistaken, this is so-and-so‚Äôs residence.‚Äù Sunlight came through the windows slowly, like something liquid pouring between the red curtains on to the rug. The sunlight was like an arpeggio that Tom could almost hear‚Äîthis time Chopin, perhaps. Tom realized that he was afraid to ring Reeves in Amsterdam and ask what was happening. The call hadn‚Äôt sounded like a long-distance call, but it wasn‚Äôt always possible to tell. It could have come from Paris. Or Amsterdam. Or Milan. Tom had an unlisted number. The operator wouldn‚Äôt give his name or address, but from the exchange‚Äî424‚Äîit would be easy for the man who had the number to find the district, if he cared to. It was part of the Fontainebleau area. Tom knew it wouldn‚Äôt be impossible for the Mafia to find out that Tom Ripley lived in this area, in Villeperce even, because the Derwatt affair had been in the newspapers, Tom‚Äôs photograph also, just six months ago. Much depended, of course, on the second bodyguard, alive and uninjured, who had walked the train in search of his capo and his colleague. This one might remember Tom‚Äôs face from the restaurant car.

Tom was again on the Goldberg variation base when the telephone rang a second time. Ten minutes had passed, he thought, since the first call. This time he was going to say it was the house of Robert Wilson. There was no concealing his American accent.

‚ÄúOui,‚Äù Tom said in a bored tone.

‚ÄúHello‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Hello,‚Äù Tom said, recognizing Jonathan Trevanny‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you,‚Äù Jonathan said, ‚Äúif you‚Äôve got some time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äî Today?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you could, yes. I can‚Äôt‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to make it around the lunch-hour, if you don‚Äôt mind. Later today?‚Äù

‚ÄúSevenish?‚Äù

‚ÄúEven six-thirty. Can you come to Fontainebleau?‚Äù

Tom agreed to meet Jonathan at the Salamandre Bar. Tom could guess what it was about: Jonathan couldn‚Äôt explain the money properly to his wife. Jonathan sounded worried, but not desperate.

At 6 p.m., Tom took the Renault, because Heloise was not back with the Alfa. Heloise had telephoned to say she was going to have cocktails with No√´lle, and might also have dinner with her. And she had bought a beautiful suitcase at Herm√®s, because it had been on sale. Heloise thought that the more she bought at sales, the more she was being economical, and positively virtuous.

Tom found Jonathan already in the Salamandre, standing at the counter drinking dark beer‚Äîprobably good old Whitbread‚Äôs ale, Tom thought. The place was unusually busy and noisy this evening, and Tom supposed it would be all right to talk at the counter. Tom nodded and smiled in greeting, and ordered the same dark beer for himself.

Jonathan told him what had happened. Simone had seen the Swiss bankbook. Jonathan had told her it was an advance from the German doctors, and that he was running a risk in taking their drugs, and that this was a kind of payment for his life.

‚ÄúBut she doesn‚Äôt really believe me.‚Äù Jonathan smiled. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs even suggested I impersonated somebody in Germany to get an inheritance for a gang of crooks‚Äîsomething like that‚Äîand that this is my cut. Or that I‚Äôve borne false witness for something.‚Äù Jonathan gave a laugh. He actually had to shout to be heard, but he was sure no one was listening in the vicinity, or could understand if they did. Three barmen were working frantically behind the counter, pouring Pernods and red wine and drawing glasses of lager from the tap.

‚ÄúI can understand,‚Äù Tom said, glancing at the noisy fray around him. He was still concerned about the telephone call he had got that morning, which hadn‚Äôt been repeated in the afternoon. He had even looked around Belle Ombre and Villeperce, as he drove out at 6 p.m., for any strange figures on the streets. It was odd how one finally knew everybody in the village, by their figures, even at a distance, so that a newcomer at once caught the eye. Tom had even been afraid, a little, when he started the motor of the Renault. Fixing dynamite to the ignition was a favorite Mafia prank. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to think!‚Äù Tom shouted, earnestly.

Jonathan nodded and quaffed his beer. ‚ÄúFunny she‚Äôs suggested nearly everything I might‚Äôve done short of murder!‚Äù

Tom put his foot on the rail and tried to think in all the din. He looked at a pocket of Jonathan‚Äôs old corduroy jacket where a rip had been neatly mended, no doubt by Simone. Tom said in sudden desperation, ‚ÄúI wonder what‚Äôs the matter with telling her the truth? After all, these Mafiosi, these morpions‚Äî‚Äù

Jonathan shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought of that. Simone‚Äîshe‚Äôs a Catholic. That‚Äî‚Äù Being regularly on the pill was a kind of concession for Simone to have made. Jonathan saw the Catholic retreat as a slow one: they didn‚Äôt want to be seen to be routed, even if they gave in here and there. Georges was being raised as a Catholic, inevitable in this country, but Jonathan tried to make Georges see that it wasn‚Äôt the only religion in the world, tried to make him understand that he would be free to make his own choice when he grew a little older, and his efforts had so far not been opposed by Simone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so different for her,‚Äù Jonathan shouted, now getting used to the noise and almost liking its protective wall. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be really a shock‚Äîsomething she couldn‚Äôt forgive, you know. Human life and all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuman! Ha-ha!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe thing is,‚Äù Jonathan said, serious again, ‚Äúit‚Äôs almost like my whole marriage. I mean, as if my marriage itself was at stake.‚Äù He looked at Tom, who was trying to follow him. ‚ÄúWhat a hell of a place to talk about something serious!‚Äù Jonathan began again with determination, ‚ÄúThings are not the same between us, to put it mildly. And I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre going to get any better. I was simply hoping you might have an idea‚Äîas to what I should do or say. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt know why you should. It‚Äôs my problem.‚Äù

Tom was thinking they might find a quieter place, or sit in his car. But would he be able to think any better in a quieter place? ‚ÄúI will try to get an idea!‚Äù Tom yelled. Why did everyone‚Äîeven Jonathan‚Äîsuppose that he could come up with an idea for them? Tom often thought he had a hard enough time trying to steer a course for himself. His own welfare often required ideas, those inspirations that came sometimes while he was under the shower, or gardening, those gifts of the gods that were presented only after his own anxious pondering. A single person hadn‚Äôt the mental equipment to take on the problems of another and maintain the same degree of excellence, Tom thought. Then Tom reflected that his own welfare was tied up with Jonathan‚Äôs after all, and if Jonathan cracked up‚Äîbut Tom couldn‚Äôt imagine Jonathan saying to anyone that Tom had been on the train with him, helping him. There shouldn‚Äôt be any need to say that, and Jonathan as a matter of principle wouldn‚Äôt. How does one suddenly acquire about ninety-two thousand dollars? That was the problem. It was the question Simone was asking Jonathan.

‚ÄúIf we could only make a double-barreled thing out of it,‚Äù Tom said finally.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething added to the sum the doctors might have paid you.‚Äî How about a bet? One doctor has bet another in Germany, and they‚Äôve both deposited the money with you, a sort of trust fund‚ÄîI mean it‚Äôs in trust with you. That could account for‚Äîlet‚Äôs say fifty thousand dollars of it, more than half. Or are you thinking in francs? Um-m‚Äîmore than two hundred and fifty thousand francs, perhaps.‚Äù

Jonathan smiled. The idea was amusing, but rather wild. ‚ÄúAnother beer?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Tom, and lit a Gauloise. ‚ÄúLook. You might say to Simone that‚Äîthat because the bet seemed so frivolous, or ruthless or whatever, you hadn‚Äôt wanted to tell her, but there‚Äôs a bet on your life. One doctor has bet that you‚Äôll live‚Äîa full life span, for instance. That would leave you and Simone with a little more than two hundred thousand francs of your own‚Äîwhich by the way I hope you‚Äôve already begun to enjoy!‚Äù

Tock! Tock! A hectic barman set down Tom‚Äôs fresh glass and bottle. Jonathan was already on his second.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve bought a sofa‚Äîmuch needed,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúWe could treat ourselves to a telly too. Your idea is better than nothing. Thank you.‚Äù

A stocky man of about sixty greeted Jonathan with a brief handshake and walked on toward the back of the bar with no glance at Tom. Tom stared at two blonde girls who were being chatted up by a trio of boys in bell-bottom trousers standing by their table. A roly-poly old dog with skinny legs looked miserably up at Tom as he waited on his leash for his master to finish his petit rouge.

‚ÄúHeard from Reeves lately?‚Äù Tom asked.

‚ÄúLately‚Äînot in about a month, I think.‚Äù

Then Jonathan didn‚Äôt know about Reeves‚Äôs flat being bombed, and Tom saw no reason to tell him. It would only shake his morale.

‚ÄúHave you? Is he all right?‚Äù

Tom said casually, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know,‚Äù as if Reeves was not in the habit of writing or telephoning. Tom felt suddenly ill at ease, as if eyes were on him. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take off, shall we?‚Äù He beckoned to the barman to take his two ten-franc notes, though Jonathan had pulled out his money also. ‚ÄúMy car‚Äôs outside to the right.‚Äù

On the pavement, Jonathan began awkwardly, ‚ÄúYou feel you‚Äôre all right yourself? Nothing to worry about?‚Äù

Now they were beside his car. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the worrying type. You‚Äôd never think so, would you? I try to think of the worst before it happens. Not quite the same as being pessimistic.‚Äù Tom smiled. ‚ÄúYou going home? I‚Äôll drop you off.‚Äù

Jonathan got into the car.

When Tom got in and closed the door, he at once had a sense of privacy, as if they were in a room in his own house. And how long would his house be safe? Tom had an unpleasant vision of the ubiquitous Mafia, like black cockroaches darting everywhere, coming from everywhere. If he fled his house, getting Heloise and Mme. Annette out before him or with him, the Mafia might simply set fire to Belle Ombre. Tom thought of the harpsichord burning, or going up in pieces from a bomb. Tom admitted that he had a love of house and home usually found only in women.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in more danger than you, if that bodyguard, the second one, can identify my face. I‚Äôve had a few pictures in the newspapers, that‚Äôs the trouble,‚Äù Tom said.

Jonathan knew. ‚ÄúI apologize for asking to see you today. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm awfully worried about my wife. It‚Äôs because‚Äîhow we get along is the most important thing in my life. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever tried to deceive her about anything, you see. And I‚Äôve rather failed‚Äîso it‚Äôs shattering to me. But‚Äîyou were a help. Thanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôs all right this time,‚Äù Tom said pleasantly. He meant their seeing each other this evening. ‚ÄúBut it occurs to me‚Äî‚Äù Tom opened the glove compartment, and took out the Italian gun. ‚ÄúI think you ought to have this handy. In your shop, for instance.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äî To tell you the truth, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd be hopeless in a shoot-out.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than nothing. If someone comes into your shop who looks odd‚Äî Haven‚Äôt you got a drawer just behind your counter?‚Äù

A tingle went up Jonathan‚Äôs spine, because he‚Äôd had a dream a few nights ago of exactly that: a Mafia gunman coming into his shop and shooting him point-blank in the face. ‚ÄúBut why do you think I‚Äôll need it? There‚Äôs some reason, isn‚Äôt there?‚Äù

Suddenly Tom thought, why not tell Jonathan? It might inspire him to more caution. At the same time Tom knew that caution wasn‚Äôt of much help. It also occurred to Tom that Jonathan would be safer if he took his wife and child away on a trip for a while. ‚ÄúYes, I had a telephone call today that bothered me. A man who sounded French, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything. He asked for some French name. It may not mean anything and yet I can‚Äôt be sure. Because as soon as I open my mouth, I sound like an American, and he may have been verifying‚Äî‚Äù Tom trailed off. ‚ÄúTo fill you in further, Reeves‚Äôs place in Hamburg was bombed‚ÄîI suppose it was around the middle of April.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis flat. Good God! Was he injured?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one was in the place at the time. But Reeves went to Amsterdam in a hurry. He‚Äôs still there as far as I know, under another name.‚Äù

Jonathan thought of Reeves‚Äôs flat being looked over for names and addresses, of his and maybe Tom Ripley‚Äôs also being found. ‚ÄúThen how much does the enemy know?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Reeves says he has all his important papers under control. They got hold of Fritz‚ÄîI suppose you know Fritz‚Äîand beat him up a bit, but according to Reeves, Fritz was heroic. He gave them an opposite description of you‚Äîyou being the man Reeves hired, or somebody hired.‚Äù Tom sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming they suspect Reeves and a few casino club men‚Äîonly.‚Äù He glanced at Jonathan‚Äôs wide eyes. Jonathan didn‚Äôt look so much frightened as jolted.

‚ÄúGood Christ!‚Äù Jonathan whispered. ‚ÄúDo you suppose they got hold of my address‚Äîor our addresses?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Tom said, smiling, ‚Äúor they‚Äôd have been here already, I can tell you that.‚Äù Tom wanted to get home. He turned on the ignition and maneuvered himself into the traffic of the Rue Grande.

‚ÄúThen‚Äîassuming the man who phoned you was one of them, how did he get your number?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow we enter the realm of guesswork,‚Äù Tom said, getting his car into the clear at last. He was still smiling. Yes, it was dangerous, and this time he wasn‚Äôt getting a penny out of it, not even protecting his own money, which was what he had done at least in the Derwatt near-fiasco. ‚ÄúMaybe because Reeves was stupid enough to ring me from Amsterdam. I‚Äôm toying with the possibility that the Mafia boys might‚Äôve traced him to Amsterdam, because for one thing he‚Äôs having his housekeeper send his possessions there. Pretty stupid move, so soon,‚Äù Tom said as if in parentheses. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering, you see, if‚Äîeven if Reeves got out of his Amsterdam hotel, the Mafia boys didn‚Äôt check on the phone calls he made. In which case my number might be there. By the way, he didn‚Äôt ring you, I trust, when he was in Amsterdam. You‚Äôre sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe last call I had was from Hamburg, I know.‚Äù Jonathan remembered Reeves‚Äôs cheerful voice, telling him his money, all of it, would be deposited at once in the Swiss bank. Jonathan was worried about the bulge of the gun in his pocket. ‚ÄúSorry, but I‚Äôd better go to my shop first to get rid of this gun. Drop me anywhere here.‚Äù

Tom pulled up to a curb. ‚ÄúTake it easy. If you‚Äôre seriously‚Äîalarmed about anything, go ahead and ring me. I mean that.‚Äù

Jonathan gave an awkward smile, because he felt scared. ‚ÄúOr if I can be of help‚Äîdo the same.‚Äù

Tom drove on.

Jonathan walked toward his shop, one hand in his pocket supporting the weight of the gun. He put the gun into his cash drawer which slid under the heavy counter. Tom was right, the gun was better than nothing, and Jonathan knew he had another advantage: he didn‚Äôt care much about his own life. It wouldn‚Äôt be like Tom Ripley getting shot or whatever, losing his life while in the best of health, and for literally nothing, it seemed to Jonathan.

If a man walked into his shop with intent to shoot him, and if he was lucky enough to be able to shoot the man first, it would be the end of the game, anyway. Jonathan didn‚Äôt need Tom Ripley to tell him that. The gunshot would bring people, the police, the dead man would be identified, and the question would be asked, ‚ÄúWhy should a Mafia man want to shoot at Jonathan Trevanny?‚Äù The train journey would be the next thing exposed, because the police would ask his movements in the last weeks, would want to see his passport. He‚Äôd be finished.

Jonathan locked his shop door and walked on toward the Rue St. Merry. He was thinking of Reeves‚Äôs flat bombed, all those books, the records, the paintings. He was thinking of Fritz who had guided him to the button man called Salvatore Bianca, of Fritz beaten up and not betraying him.

It was nearly 7:30 p.m., and Simone was in the kitchen. ‚ÄúBonsoir!‚Äù Jonathan said, smiling.

‚ÄúBonsoir,‚Äù Simone said. She turned the oven down, then straightened and removed her apron. ‚ÄúAnd what were you doing with M. Ripley this evening?‚Äù

Jonathan‚Äôs face tingled a little. Where had she seen them? When he‚Äôd got out of Tom‚Äôs car? ‚ÄúHe came to talk about some framing,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúSo we had a beer. It was near closing time.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù She looked at Jonathan, not moving. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Jonathan hung his jacket in the hall. Georges was coming down the stairs to greet him, saying something about his hovercraft. Georges was assembling a model Jonathan had bought for him, and it was a little too complicated for him. Jonathan swung him up over his shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have a look at it after dinner, all right?‚Äù

The atmosphere did not improve. They had a delicious pur√©e of vegetable soup, made in a six-hundred-franc mixer that Jonathan had just bought: it made fruit juices and pulverized almost everything, including some chicken bones. Jonathan tried without success to talk about other things. Simone could soon bring any subject to a halt. It wasn‚Äôt impossible, Jonathan was thinking, that Tom Ripley should want him to frame some pictures. After all, Tom had said he painted. Jonathan said:

‚ÄúRipley is interested in framing several things. I might have to go to his house to look at them.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù in the same tone. Then she said something pleasant to Georges.

Jonathan disliked Simone when she was like this, and hated himself for disliking her. He had been going to plunge into the explanation‚Äîthe bet explanation‚Äîof the sum of money in the Swiss bank. That evening, he simply couldn‚Äôt.





17


After dropping Jonathan, Tom had an impulse to stop at a bar-caf√© and ring his house. He wanted to know if all was well, and if Heloise was home. To his great relief Heloise answered.

‚ÄúOui, ch√©ri, I just got home. Where are you? No, I had only a drink with No√´lle.‚Äù

‚ÄúHeloise, my pet, let‚Äôs do something nice tonight. Maybe the Grais or the Berthelins are free . . . I know it‚Äôs late to ask anyone for dinner, but for after dinner. Maybe the Cleggs . . . Yes, I feel like seeing some people.‚Äù Tom said he would be home in fifteen minutes.

Tom drove fast, but carefully. He felt curiously shaky about tonight. He was wondering about any telephone calls that Mme. Annette might have got since he left the house.

Heloise, or Mme. Annette, had put the front light on at Belle Ombre, though the dusk had not yet fallen. A big Citro√´n cruised slowly past, just before Tom turned into his gates, and Tom looked at it: dark-blue, lumbering on the slightly uneven road, with a license plate ending in 75, meaning a Paris car. There had been two people in it at least. Was it casing Belle Ombre? He was probably overanxious.

‚ÄúHello, Tome! Les Clegg can come for a quick drink, and les Grais can come for dinner, because Antoine didn‚Äôt go to Paris today. Does that please you?‚Äù Heloise kissed his cheek. ‚ÄúWhere were you? Look at the suitcase!‚Äî I admit it‚Äôs not very big‚Äî‚Äù

Tom looked at the dark-purple suitcase with a red canvas band around it. The clasps and the lock appeared to be brass. The purple leather looked like kid, and perhaps was. ‚ÄúYes. It really is pretty.‚Äù It really was, like their harpsichord, or like his commode de bateau upstairs.

‚ÄúAnd look‚Äîinside.‚Äù Heloise opened it. ‚ÄúReally str-rong,‚Äù she said in English.

Tom stooped and kissed her hair. ‚ÄúDarling, it‚Äôs lovely. We can celebrate the suitcase‚Äîand the harpsichord. The Cleggs and the Grais haven‚Äôt seen the harpsichord, have they? No. . . . How is No√´lle?‚Äù

‚ÄúTome, something is making you nervous,‚Äù Heloise said in a soft voice, in case Mme. Annette might hear.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Tom. ‚ÄúI just feel like seeing some people. I had a very quiet day. Ah, Mme. Annette, bonsoir! People tonight. Two for dinner. Can you manage?‚Äù

Mme. Annette had just arrived with the bar cart. ‚ÄúMais oui, M. Tome. It will have to be √† la fortune du pot, but I shall try a rago√ªt‚Äîmy Normandy style, if you remember . . .‚Äù

Tom didn‚Äôt listen to her ingredients‚Äîthere was beef, veal, and kidney, because she‚Äôd had time to pop out to the butcher‚Äôs this evening, and it was not going to be potluck at all, Tom was sure. But Tom had to wait until she finished. Then he said, ‚ÄúBy the way, Mme. Annette, were there any telephone calls since six when I left?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, M. Tome.‚Äù With expertise Mme. Annette extracted the cork of a small bottle of champagne.

‚ÄúNone at all? Not even a wrong number?‚Äù

‚ÄúNon, M. Tome.‚Äù Mme. Annette poured champagne carefully into a wide glass for Heloise.

Heloise was watching him. But Tom decided to persist, rather than go into the kitchen to speak with Mme. Annette. Or should he not go into the kitchen? Yes. That was quite easy. When Mme. Annette went back to the kitchen, Tom said to Heloise, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll get a beer.‚Äù Mme. Annette had left him to make his own drink, as Tom often preferred to do.

In the kitchen, Mme. Annette had her dinner in full swing, vegetables washed and ready, and something already boiling on the stove. ‚ÄúMadame,‚Äù Tom said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs very important‚Äîtoday. Are you quite sure nobody telephoned at all? Even somebody‚Äîeven by error?‚Äù

This seemed to jog her memory, to Tom‚Äôs alarm. ‚ÄúAh, oui, the telephone rang around six-thirty. A man asked for‚Äîsome other name I can‚Äôt recall, M. Tome. Then he hung up. An error, M. Tome.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you say to him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said it was not the residence of the person he wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou told him it was the Ripley residence?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, M. Tome. I simply said it was not the right number. I thought that was the correct thing to do.‚Äù

Tom beamed at her. It had been the correct thing to do. Tom had reproached himself for going off at 6 p.m. today without asking Mme. Annette not to give his name under any circumstances, and she‚Äôd handled everything properly on her own initiative. ‚ÄúExcellent. That‚Äôs always the correct thing to do,‚Äù Tom said with admiration. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I have an unlisted number, in order to have a little privacy, n‚Äôest-ce pas?‚Äù

‚ÄúBien s√ªr,‚Äù said Mme. Annette, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Tom went back to the living room, forgetting all about beer. He poured a scotch for himself. He was not much reassured, however. If it had been a Mafioso looking for him, he might be doubly suspicious because two people at this house had refrained from giving the name of the proprietor. Tom wondered if some checking was going on in Milan or Amsterdam or perhaps Hamburg? Didn‚Äôt Tom Ripley live in Villeperce? Couldn‚Äôt this 424 number be a Villeperce number? Yes, indeed. Fontainebleau numbers began with 422, but 424 was an area southward, including Villeperce.

‚ÄúWhat is worrying you, Tome?‚Äù Heloise asked.

‚ÄúNothing, darling.‚Äî What‚Äôs happening with your cruise plans? Have you seen anything you like?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, yes! Something which is not casse-pied swank, just nice and simple. A cruise from Venice around the Mediterranean, including Turkey. Fifteen days‚Äîand one doesn‚Äôt have to dress for dinner. How does that sound, Tome? Every three weeks during May and June, for instance, the boat leaves.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not much in the mood at the moment. Ask No√´lle if she‚Äôd go with you. It would do you good.‚Äù

Tom went upstairs to his room. He opened the bottom drawers of his bigger chest of drawers. On top was Heloise‚Äôs green jacket from Salzburg. At the back on the bottom of the drawer lay a Luger which Tom had acquired just three months ago from Reeves, oddly enough, not directly from Reeves but from a man whom Tom had had to meet in Paris in order to get something the man was delivering, something that Tom had had to hold for a month before posting it. As a favor, as a kind of payment really, Tom had requested a Luger, and it had been given him‚Äîa 7.65 mm. with two little boxes of ammunition. Tom verified that the gun was loaded, then he went to his closet and looked at his French-made hunting rifle. It was loaded also, with the safety on it. It was the Luger he would need in case of trouble, Tom supposed, tonight or tomorrow or tomorrow night. Tom looked out the two windows of his room, which gave in two directions. He was looking for cruising cars with dimmed lights, but he didn‚Äôt see any. It was already dark.

A car approached with a determined air from the left: this was the dear, harmless Cleggs, and they turned in smartly through the gates of Belle Ombre. Tom went down to welcome them.

The Cleggs‚ÄîHoward, fiftyish, an Englishman and his English wife, Rosemary‚Äîstayed for two drinks, and the Grais joined them. Clegg, a retired lawyer, retired because of a heart condition, nevertheless was more animated than anyone else. His gray, neatly cut hair, seasoned tweed jacket and gray flannels, lent the air of country stability that Tom needed. Clegg, standing with his back to the curtained front window, scotch in hand, telling a funny story‚ÄîWhat could happen tonight to shatter this rural conviviality? Tom had left his room light on, and he had turned on the bedside lamp in Heloise‚Äôs room also. The two cars were parked carelessly on the gravel. Tom wanted his house to present the picture of a party in progress, a party bigger than it was. Not that this would really stop the Mafia boys, if they chose to toss a bomb, Tom knew, and therefore he was putting his friends in danger, perhaps. But Tom had the feeling the Mafia would prefer a quiet assassination for him: get him alone and then attack, maybe without a gun, just a sudden beating up that would be fatal. The Mafia could do it on the streets of Villeperce, and be away before the townspeople knew what had happened.

Rosemary Clegg, slim and beautiful in a middle-aged way, was promising Heloise some kind of plant that she and Howard had just brought back from England.

‚ÄúAre you intending to set any fires this summer?‚Äù Antoine Grais asked.

‚ÄúNot really my dish,‚Äù Tom said, smiling. ‚ÄúCome out and take a look at the greenhouse-to-be.‚Äù

Tom and Antoine walked out the French windows and down the steps onto the lawn, Tom with a flashlight. The foundation had been laid with cement, the pieces for the steel frame were stacked alongside, doing the lawn no good, and the workmen hadn‚Äôt been around for a week. Tom had been warned by one of the villagers about this crew: they had so much work this summer, they hopped from one job to the next, trying to please everybody, or at least keep a lot of people on the hook.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs coming along, I think,‚Äù said Antoine finally.

Tom had consulted Antoine as to the best type of greenhouse, paid him for his services, and Antoine had also been able to get the materials for him at a professional discount, or anyway more cheaply than the mason would have got them. Tom found himself glancing toward the lane through the woods behind Antoine, where there were no lights at all, certainly no car lights now.

But by 11 p.m., after dinner when the four of them were drinking coffee and B√©n√©dictine, Tom made up his mind to get both Heloise and Mme. Annette out of the house by tomorrow. Heloise would be the easier. He‚Äôd persuade her to stay with No√´lle for a few days‚ÄîNo√´lle and her husband had a very large flat in Neuilly‚Äîor to stay with her parents. Mme. Annette had a sister in Lyon, and fortunately the sister had a telephone, so something might be arranged quickly. And the explanation? Tom shrank from the idea of putting on an act of crotchetyness, such as, ‚ÄúI must be alone for a few days,‚Äù and if he admitted that there was danger, Heloise and Mme. Annette would be alarmed. They‚Äôd want to alert the police.

Tom approached Heloise that evening, as they were getting ready for bed. ‚ÄúMy dear,‚Äù he said in English, ‚ÄúI have a feeling something awful is going to happen, and I don‚Äôt want you here. It‚Äôs a matter of your safety. Also I would like Mme. Annette to leave tomorrow for a few days‚Äîso I hope, darling, you can help me persuade her to visit her sister.‚Äù

Heloise, propped up on pale-blue pillows, frowned a little and set down the yogurt she was eating. ‚ÄúWhat is happening that is awful?‚Äî Tome, you must tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Tom shook his head, then he laughed. ‚ÄúAnd maybe I‚Äôm only anxious. Maybe it‚Äôs for nothing. But there‚Äôs no harm in playing it safe, is there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a lot of words, Tome. What has happened? Something with Reeves! It is that, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn a way.‚Äù It was a lot better than saying it was the Mafia.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs in Amsterdam, I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt he live in Germany?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but he‚Äôs doing some work in Amsterdam.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut who else is involved? Why are you worried?‚Äî What have you done, Tome?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, nothing, darling!‚Äù It was Tom‚Äôs usual answer under the circumstances. He wasn‚Äôt even ashamed of it.

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre trying to protect Reeves?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs done me a few favors. But I want to protect you now ‚Äîand us, and Belle Ombre. Not Reeves. So you must let me try, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúBelle Ombre?‚Äù

Tom smiled and said calmly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any disturbance at Belle Ombre. I don‚Äôt want anything broken, not a pane of glass. You must trust me, I‚Äôm trying to avoid anything violent‚Äîor dangerous!‚Äù

Heloise blinked her eyes and said in a slightly piqued tone, ‚ÄúAll right, Tome.‚Äù

He knew that Heloise would ask no more questions, not unless there was an accusation by the police, or a Mafia corpse to account for to her. A few minutes later, they were both smiling, and Tom slept in her bed that night. How much worse it must be for Jonathan Trevanny, Tom thought‚Äînot that Simone appeared difficult, prying or neurotic in the least, but Jonathan was not in the habit of doing anything out of the ordinary, not even of telling white lies. It must be, as Jonathan had said, shattering if his wife had begun to mistrust him. And because of the money, it was natural that Simone would think of crime, of something shameful that Jonathan couldn‚Äôt admit.

In the morning, Heloise and Tom spoke to Mme. Annette together. Heloise had had her tea upstairs, and Tom was drinking a second coffee in the living room.

‚ÄúM. Tome says he wants to be alone and think and paint for a few days,‚Äù said Heloise.

They had decided this was best after all. ‚ÄúAnd a little vacation wouldn‚Äôt do you any harm, Mme. Annette. A little one before the big one in August,‚Äù Tom added, though Mme. Annette, sturdy and lively as always, looked in the best of form.

‚ÄúBut if you wish, Madame et M‚Äôsieur, of course. That is the big thing, is it not?‚Äù She was smiling, her blue eyes not exactly twinkling now, but she was agreeable.

Mme. Annette at once agreed to ring her sister Marie-Odile in Lyon.

The post came at 9:30 a.m. In it was a square, white envelope with a Swiss stamp, the address printed‚ÄîReeves‚Äôs printing, Tom suspected‚Äîand no return address. Tom wanted to open it in the living room, but Heloise was talking with Mme. Annette about driving her to Paris for the train to Lyon, so Tom went up to his room. The letter said:

May 11

Dear Tom:

I am in Ascona. Had to leave Amsterdam because of a near thing in my hotel, but have managed to put my belongings in store in Amsterdam. God, I wish they would lay off! I am here in this pretty town, known as Ralph Platt, staying at an inn up the hill called Die Drei Baeren‚Äîcozy? At least it is very out of the way and family pension style. Wishing the very best to you and Heloise,

As ever,

R.

Tom crushed the letter in his hand, then shredded it into his wastebasket. It was exactly as bad as Tom had thought: the Mafia had caught up with him at Amsterdam, and had doubtless got Tom‚Äôs telephone number by checking all the numbers Reeves had called. Tom wondered what the near thing at the hotel had been? He swore to himself, not for the first time, that he‚Äôd never have anything to do with Reeves Minot in future. In this case, all he‚Äôd provided was an idea for Reeves. That should have been harmless, and it was harmless. Tom realized his mistake had been to try to help Jonathan Trevanny. And of course Reeves didn‚Äôt know that, or Reeves wouldn‚Äôt have been stupid enough to ring him at Belle Ombre.

He wanted Jonathan Trevanny to come to Belle Ombre by this evening, even this afternoon, though he knew Jonathan worked on Saturday. If anything happened, the situation could be more easily handled by two people, at front and back of the house, for instance, because one person couldn‚Äôt be everywhere. And who else had he to call on but Jonathan? Jonathan wasn‚Äôt a promising fighter, and yet in a crisis he might come through, just as he had on the train. He‚Äôd done all right there, and had also, Tom remembered, yanked him back to safety when he‚Äôd been surely going to fall out the train door. He wanted Jonathan to stay the night, and he‚Äôd have to fetch him, too, because there was no bus, and Tom didn‚Äôt want him to take a taxi, in view of what might happen tonight, didn‚Äôt want any taxi driver to recall that he‚Äôd driven a man from Fontainebleau to Villeperce, a rather unusual distance.

‚ÄúYou will telephone me tonight, Tome?‚Äù Heloise asked. She was packing a big suitcase in her room. She was going first to her family.

‚ÄúYes, my love. Around seven-thirty?‚Äù He knew Heloise‚Äôs parents dined promptly at 8 p.m. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ring and say ‚ÄòAll is well,‚Äô probably.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it only tonight you are worried about?‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt, but Tom didn‚Äôt want to say so. ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

When Heloise and Mme. Annette were ready to leave around 11 a.m., Tom managed to enter the garage first, before he even helped them with their luggage, though Mme. Annette had the old French school idea that she should carry the luggage of both in installments, simply because she was a servant. Tom looked under the hood of the Alfa. The motor presented the familiar picture of metal and wires. He started the motor. No explosion. Tom had gone out and padlocked the garage doors last evening before dinner, but Tom believed anything when it came to the Mafia. They‚Äôd pick a padlock and snap it shut again.

‚ÄúWe will be in touch, Mme. Annette,‚Äù Tom said, kissing her cheek. ‚ÄúEnjoy yourself!‚Äù

‚ÄúBye-bye, Tome! Ring me tonight! And take care!‚Äù Heloise shouted.

Tom grinned as he waved good-bye. He could tell that Heloise wasn‚Äôt very worried. That was all to the good.

Tom then went into his house to telephone Jonathan.





18


The morning had been a rough one for Jonathan. Simone had said, in a pleasant enough tone, because she was then helping Georges tug himself into a turtleneck sweater:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how this ambience can go on forever, Jon. Do you?‚Äù

Simone and Georges had to leave for Georges‚Äô school in a couple of minutes. It was almost 8:15 a.m.

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. And about that Swiss sum‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan determined to plunge on, now. He spoke quickly, hoping Georges wouldn‚Äôt grasp all of it. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve made a bet, if you must know. I‚Äôm holding the take for both of them. So that‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Simone looked as puzzled and angry as ever.

‚ÄúThe doctors,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying a new treatment ‚Äîone is‚Äîand somebody‚Äôs betting against him. Another doctor. I thought you‚Äôd think it rather macabre, so I wasn‚Äôt going to tell you about it. But that means there‚Äôs really only about two hundred thousand, less now, belonging to us. They‚Äôre paying me that, the Hamburg people, for trying out their pills.‚Äù

Jonathan could see that she tried, and couldn‚Äôt believe him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absurd!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAll that money, Jon! For a bet?‚Äù

Georges looked up at her.

Jonathan glanced at his son and wet his lips.

‚ÄúDo you know what I think, and I don‚Äôt care if Georges hears me! I think you are holding‚Äîconcealing dishonest money for this dishonest type Tom Ripley. And of course he‚Äôs paying you a little, letting you have a little of it for doing him the favor!‚Äù

Jonathan realized he was trembling, and set his bowl of caf√© au lait down on the kitchen table. Both he and Simone were standing. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt Ripley conceal his own money himself in Switzerland?‚Äù Jonathan‚Äôs instinct was to go to her and grasp her by the shoulders, tell her that she had to believe him. But he knew quite well she‚Äôd push him back. So he simply stood up straighter and said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it if you don‚Äôt believe me. That‚Äôs the way it is.‚Äù Jonathan had had a transfusion last Monday afternoon, the day he had fainted. Simone had gone to the hospital with him, and then he had gone by himself afterward to Dr. Perrier, whom he‚Äôd had to ring earlier to make the appointment for the transfusion for him. Dr. Perrier had wanted to see him as a matter of routine. But Jonathan had told Simone that Dr. Perrier had given him more of the medicaments sent by the Hamburg doctor. The Hamburg doctor, Wentzel, hadn‚Äôt sent pills, but the pills he recommended were available in France, and Jonathan had a supply at home now. It was the Hamburg doctor Jonathan had decided should be betting ‚Äúfor‚Äù and the Munich doctor who should be betting ‚Äúagainst,‚Äù but he hadn‚Äôt got that far with Simone as yet.

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt believe you,‚Äù Simone said, her voice gentle and also sinister. ‚ÄúCome along, Georges, we‚Äôve got to go.‚Äù

Jonathan blinked, and watched Simone and Georges go up the hall toward the front door. Georges picked up his satchel of books, and perhaps startled by the heated conversation, forgot to say good-bye to Jonathan, and Jonathan was silent too.

Since it was Saturday, Jonathan‚Äôs shop was busy. The telephone rang several times. Around 11 a.m., the voice on the other end of the telephone was Tom Ripley‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you today. It‚Äôs rather important,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúAre you able to talk now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù There was a man at the counter in front of Jonathan, waiting to pay for his picture which lay wrapped between them.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to bother you on a Saturday. But I‚Äôm wondering how soon you could get to my house‚Äîand stay the evening?‚Äù

Jonathan was jolted for a second. Close the shop. Inform Simone. Inform her what? ‚ÄúOf course I can. Yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow soon? I‚Äôll pick you up. Say at twelve noon? Or is that too soon?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôll make it.‚Äù

‚ÄúPick you up at your shop. Or on the street there. One other thing‚Äîbring the gun.‚Äù Tom hung up.

Jonathan attended to the people in his shop, and while there was still someone in his shop, he stuck the FERME sign in his door. He wondered what had happened to Tom Ripley since yesterday? Simone was home that morning, but she was more often out than in on Saturday mornings, because she did marketing and chores like going to the dry cleaners. Jonathan decided to write Simone a note and push it through the letter slot in the front door. Jonathan had the note written by 11:40 a.m., and went off with it, up the Rue de la Paroisse, the quickest way, where there was a fifty-fifty chance of encountering Simone, but he didn‚Äôt. He stuck the note through the slot marked LETTRES, and walked back quickly the way he had come. He had written:

My dear:

Won‚Äôt be home for lunch or dinner and have closed the shop. Chance of a big job some distance away and am being taken there by car.

J.

It was inexplicit, not at all like him. And yet, how could things get any worse than they‚Äôd been that morning?

Jonathan went into his shop again, grabbed his old mac, and stuck the Italian gun into its pocket. When he went out on the pavement again, Tom‚Äôs green Renault was approaching. Tom opened the door, barely stopping, and Jonathan got in.

‚ÄúMorning!‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúHow are things?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt home?‚Äù Jonathan was, despite himself, glancing about for Simone who might be anywhere on the streets here. ‚ÄúNot very good, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

Tom could imagine. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre feeling all right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, thanks.‚Äù

Tom made the right turn by the Prisunic into the Rue Grande. ‚ÄúI had another telephone call,‚Äù Tom said, ‚Äúrather my housekeeper did. Same as before, a wrong number, and she didn‚Äôt tell him whose house it was, but it‚Äôs made me nervous. By the way I‚Äôve sent my housekeeper and also my wife away. I have a hunch something might happen. So I called on you to hold the fort with me. I have no one else to ask. I‚Äôm afraid to ask the police to keep a watch. If they were to find a couple of the Mafia around my house, there‚Äôd be unpleasant inquiries as to why they were there, of course.‚Äù

Jonathan knew that.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not at my house yet,‚Äù Tom went on, passing the Monument now and entering the road that led toward Villeperce, ‚Äúso there‚Äôs time for you to change your mind. I‚Äôll drive you back gladly and you needn‚Äôt apologize if you don‚Äôt want to join me. There may be danger and there may not. But it‚Äôs easier for two people to be on the lookout there than for one.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Jonathan felt curiously paralyzed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt want to leave my house.‚Äù Tom was driving rather fast. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it to go up in smoke or be blown up like Reeves‚Äôs place. Reeves by the way is now in Ascona. They tracked him to Amsterdam and he had to run.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Jonathan experienced a few seconds of panic, of nausea. He felt that everything was collapsing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve‚Äî Have you seen anything odd around your house?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù Tom‚Äôs voice was cool. His cigarette stuck up at a jaunty angle.

Jonathan was thinking, he could pull out. Now. Just say to Tom he didn‚Äôt feel up to it, that he might well faint if it came to the crunch. He could go home and be safe. Jonathan took a deep breath and lowered the window a bit more. He‚Äôd be a bastard if he did that, a coward and a shit. He might at least try. He owed it to Tom Ripley. And why should he be so concerned about his own safety? Why suddenly now? Jonathan smiled a little, feeling better. ‚ÄúI told Simone about the bet on my life. It didn‚Äôt go down too well.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did she say?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe same thing. She doesn‚Äôt believe me. What‚Äôs worse, she saw me with you yesterday‚Äîsomewhere. Now she‚Äôs thinking I‚Äôm holding some money for you‚Äîin my name. Dishonest money, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Tom saw the situation. But it didn‚Äôt seem important compared to what might happen to Belle Ombre, to himself and maybe Jonathan too. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no hero, you know,‚Äù Tom said out of the blue. ‚ÄúIf the Mafia got me and tried to beat some facts out of me, I doubt if I‚Äôd be as brave as Fritz.‚Äù

Jonathan was silent. He sensed that Tom was feeling as queasy as he himself had a few seconds ago.

It was a particularly fine day, the air liquid with summer, the sunlight brilliant. It was a shame to have to work on such a day, to have to be indoors as Simone would be this afternoon. She didn‚Äôt have to work anymore, of course. Jonathan had wanted to say that to her for the past couple of weeks.

They were entering Villeperce now, a quiet village of the kind that would have perhaps only one butcher‚Äôs and one bakery.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Belle Ombre,‚Äù Tom said, nodding toward a domed tower that showed above some poplars.

They had driven perhaps half a kilometer from the village. The houses on the road were far apart and large. Belle Ombre looked like a small ch√¢teau, its lines classic and sturdy, but softened by four rounded corner towers which came all the way down to the grass. There were iron gates, and Tom had to get out and open them with a huge key he had taken from the glove compartment. Then they rolled on to the gravel in front of the garage.

‚ÄúWhat a beautiful place!‚Äù Jonathan said.

Tom nodded and smiled. ‚ÄúA wedding present from my wife‚Äôs parents, mainly. And every time I arrive lately, I‚Äôm delighted to see that it‚Äôs still standing. Please come in.‚Äù

Tom had a key for the front door, too.

‚ÄúNot used to locking up,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúUsually my housekeeper‚Äôs here.‚Äù

Jonathan walked into a wide foyer paved with white marble, then into a square living room‚Äîtwo rugs, a big fireplace, a comfortable-looking yellow satin sofa. And a harpsichord stood beside French windows. The furniture was all good, Jonathan saw, and it was well cared for.

‚ÄúTake off your mac,‚Äù Tom said. For the moment, he felt relieved‚ÄîBelle Ombre was quiet, and he hadn‚Äôt seen anything out of the ordinary in the village. He went to the hall table and took his Luger from the drawer. Jonathan watched him, and Tom smiled. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm going to carry this thing all day, hence these old trousers. Big pockets. I can see why some people prefer shoulder holsters.‚Äù Tom pushed the gun into a pocket of his trousers. ‚ÄúDo the same with yours, if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

Jonathan did.

Tom was thinking of his rifle upstairs. He was sorry to get down to business so quickly, but he thought it might be for the best. ‚ÄúCome up. I want to show you something.‚Äù

They climbed the stairway, and Tom took Jonathan into his room. Jonathan at once noticed the commode de bateau and went over for a closer look.

‚ÄúA recent present from my wife‚Äî Look‚Äî‚Äù Tom was holding his rifle. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this. For long range. Fairly accurate, but not like an army rifle, of course. I want you to look out this front window.‚Äù

Jonathan did. There was a nineteenth-century three-story house across the road, set well back and more than half-obscured by trees. Trees bordered the road on either side in a haphazard way. Jonathan was imagining a car pausing on the road outside the house gates, and that was what Tom was talking about: the rifle would be more accurate than a pistol.

‚ÄúOf course it depends on what they do,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúIf they intend to throw an incendiary bomb, for instance. Then the rifle will be the thing to use. Of course there are back windows too. And side windows. Come this way.‚Äù

Tom led Jonathan into Heloise‚Äôs room, which had a window giving on the back lawn. Here were denser trees beyond the lawn, and poplars bordering the lawn on the right.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lane going through those woods. You can faintly see it on the left. And in my atelier‚Äî‚Äù Tom went into the hall and opened a door on the left. This room had windows on the back lawn and in the direction in which the village of Villeperce lay, but only cypresses and poplars and the tiles of a small house were visible. ‚ÄúWe might keep a lookout on both sides of the house, not that we have to stay glued to the windows but‚Äî The other important point is, I want the enemy to think I‚Äôm alone here. If you‚Äî‚Äù

The telephone was ringing. Tom thought for a moment that he wouldn‚Äôt answer it, then that he might learn something if he did. He took it in his room.

‚ÄúOui?‚Äù

‚ÄúM. Ripley?‚Äù said a Frenchwoman‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúIci, Mme. Trevanny. Is my husband there by any chance?‚Äù

She sounded very tense.

‚ÄúYour husband? Mais non, madame!‚Äù Tom said with astonishment in his voice.

‚ÄúMerci, m‚Äôsieur. Excusez-moi.‚Äù She hung up.

Tom sighed. Jonathan was indeed having troubles.

Jonathan was standing in the doorway. ‚ÄúMy wife.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I said you weren‚Äôt here. You can send a pneu, if you like. Or telephone. Maybe she‚Äôs in your shop.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, I doubt that.‚Äù But she could be, because she had a key. It was only a quarter past 1 p.m. How else could Simone have obtained his number, Tom thought, if not from Jonathan‚Äôs notation in his shop? ‚ÄúOr if you like, I‚Äôll drive you back now to Fontainebleau. It‚Äôs really up to you, Jonathan.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Renunciation, Jonathan thought. Simone had known Tom was lying.

‚ÄúI apologize for lying just now. You can always blame me. I doubt if I can sink any lower in your wife‚Äôs mind anyway.‚Äù Tom at that moment didn‚Äôt give a damn, didn‚Äôt have the time or the inclination to sympathize with Simone. Jonathan wasn‚Äôt saying anything. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go down and see what the kitchen has to offer.‚Äù

Tom drew the curtains in his room almost closed, but open enough so that one could see out without stirring the curtains. He did the same in Heloise‚Äôs room, and also downstairs in the living room. Mme. Annette‚Äôs quarters he decided to let alone. They had windows on the lane side and the back lawn.

There was plenty of Mme. Annette‚Äôs delicious rago√ªt of last evening. The window over the kitchen sink had no curtains, and Tom made Jonathan sit out of view at the kitchen table, with a scotch and water.

‚ÄúWhat a shame we can‚Äôt potter in the garden this afternoon,‚Äù Tom said, washing lettuce at the sink. He had a compulsion to glance out the window at every passing car. Only two cars had passed in the last ten minutes.

Jonathan had noticed that both garage doors were wide open. Tom‚Äôs car was parked on the gravel in front of the house. It was so quiet, any footstep would be heard on the gravel, Jonathan thought.

‚ÄúAnd I can‚Äôt turn on any music, because I might drown out some other noise. What a bore,‚Äù Tom said.

Though neither ate much, they spent a long time at the table in the dining area off the living room. Tom made coffee. Since there was nothing substantial for dinner that evening, Tom telephoned the Villeperce butcher and asked for a good steak for two.

‚ÄúOh, Mme. Annette is taking a short holiday,‚Äù Tom said in response to the butcher‚Äôs question. The Ripleys were such good customers, Tom had no hesitation in asking the butcher to pick up some lettuce and a nice vegetable of some kind at the grocery next door.

The very audible crunching of tires on gravel half an hour later announced the arrival of the butcher‚Äôs van. Tom had jumped to his feet. He paid the genial butcher‚Äôs boy, who was wearing a blood-spattered apron, and tipped him. Jonathan was now looking at some books on furniture, and seemed quite content, so Tom went upstairs to pass some time by tidying his atelier, a room which Mme. Annette never touched.

A telephone call just before 5 p.m. came like a scream in the silence, a muffled scream to Tom, because he had dared to go out in the garden and was messing about with the pruning shears. Tom ran into the house, though he knew Jonathan wouldn‚Äôt touch the telephone. Jonathan was still lounging on the sofa, surrounded by books.

The call was from Heloise. She was very happy because she had rung No√´lle, and a friend of No√´lle‚Äôs, Jules Grifaud, an interior decorator, had bought a chalet in Switzerland, and was inviting No√´lle and her to drive there with him and keep him company for a week or so while he arranged his things in the house.

‚ÄúThe country around is so beautiful,‚Äù Heloise said. ‚ÄúAnd we can also help him . . .‚Äù

It sounded deadly to Tom, but if Heloise was enthusiastic, that was what mattered. He had known she wouldn‚Äôt go on that Adriatic cruise, like an ordinary tourist.

‚ÄúAre you all right, darling? . . . What are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äîa little gardening . . . Yes, everything is very tranquil.‚Äù





19


Around 7:30 p.m., when Tom was standing at the front window of his living room, he saw the dark-blue Citro√´n‚Äîthe same one he‚Äôd seen that morning, he thought‚Äîcruise past the house, this time at a faster speed, but still not as fast as the usual car which intended to get somewhere. Was it the same? In the dusk, colors were deceiving‚Äîthe difference between blue and green. But the car had been a convertible with a dirty white upper trim, like the one this morning. Tom looked at the gates of Belle Ombre, which he had left ajar, but which the butcher‚Äôs boy had closed. Tom decided to leave them closed, but not locked. They creaked a little.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù Jonathan asked. He was drinking coffee. He hadn‚Äôt wanted tea. Tom‚Äôs unease was making him uneasy, and as far as he had been able to find out, Tom had no real reason to be so anxious.

‚ÄúI think I saw the same car as I saw this morning. A dark-blue Citro√´n. The one this morning had a Paris plate. I know most of the cars around here, and only two or three people have cars with Paris plates.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you see the license now?‚Äù It looked dark to Jonathan, and he had a lamp on beside him.

‚ÄúNo‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to get the rifle.‚Äù Tom went upstairs as if borne on wings, and returned at once with the rifle. He had left no lights on upstairs. He said to Jonathan, ‚ÄúI definitely don‚Äôt want to use a gun if I can avoid it, because of the noise. It‚Äôs not the hunting season, and a gunshot might bring the neighbors‚Äîor someone might investigate. Jonathan‚Äî‚Äù

Jonathan was on his feet. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou might have to wield this rifle like a club.‚Äù Tom illustrated, so that the weightiest part of it, the butt, could be used to best effect. ‚ÄúYou can see how it works, in case you have to shoot with it. Safety‚Äôs on now.‚Äù Tom showed him.

But they‚Äôre not here, Jonathan was thinking. And at the same time he was feeling odd and unreal, as he had felt in Hamburg and in Munich, when he had known that his targets were real, and that they would materialize.

Tom was calculating how much time it would take the Citro√´n to cruise or drive around the circular road that led back to the village. They could of course turn at some convenient place on the road and come straight back. ‚ÄúIf anyone comes to the door,‚Äù Tom said, ‚ÄúI have the feeling I‚Äôm going to be plugged when I open the door. That would be the simplest for them, you see. Then the fellow with the gun jumps into the waiting car and off they go.‚Äù

Tom was a bit overwrought, Jonathan thought, but he listened carefully.

‚ÄúAnother possibility is a bomb through that window,‚Äù Tom said, gesturing toward the front window. ‚ÄúSame as Reeves had. So if you‚Äôre‚Äîum‚Äîagreeable‚Äî Sorry, but I‚Äôm not used to discussing my plans. I usually play it by ear. But if you‚Äôre willing, would you hide yourself in the shrubbery to the right of the door here‚Äîit‚Äôs thicker on the right‚Äîand clout anyone who walks up and rings the doorbell? They may not ring the doorbell, but I‚Äôll be watching with the Luger for signs of bomb throwing. Clout him fast if he‚Äôs at the door, because he‚Äôll be fast. He‚Äôll have a gun in his pocket, and all he wants is a clear view of me.‚Äù Tom went to the fireplace, where he had meant to light a fire and forgot, and took one of the third-of-a-log pieces from the wood basket. This he put on the floor to the right of the front door. It was not as heavy as the amethyst vase on the wooden chest by the door, but much easier to handle.

‚ÄúHow about,‚Äù Jonathan said, ‚Äúif I open the door? If they know what you look like, as you say, they‚Äôll see I‚Äôm not you and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Tom was surprised by Jonathan‚Äôs courageous offer. ‚ÄúFirst, they might not wait to see, just fire. And if they did look at you, and you said I don‚Äôt live here, or I‚Äôm not in, they‚Äôd only push in and see or‚Äî‚Äù Tom gave it up with a laugh, imagining the Mafia blasting Jonathan in the stomach and pushing him into the house at the same time. ‚ÄúI think you should take up the post by the door now, if you‚Äôre willing. I don‚Äôt know how long you‚Äôll have to stay there, but I can always bring you refreshments.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Jonathan took the rifle from Tom and went out. The road in front of the house was quiet. Jonathan stood in the shadow of the house, and practiced a swing with the rifle, high up so as to catch a man standing on the steps in the head.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúWould you care for a scotch now by any chance? You can leave the glass in the bushes. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it breaks.‚Äù

Jonathan smiled. ‚ÄúNo, thanks.‚Äù He crept into the shrubbery‚Äîcypress-like bushes four feet high, and laurel also. It was very dark where Jonathan was, and he felt absolutely concealed. Tom had closed the door.

Jonathan sat on the ground, his knees under his chin, and the rifle alongside near his right hand. He wondered if this could last for an hour? Longer? Or was it even a game Tom was playing? Jonathan couldn‚Äôt believe it was entirely a game. Tom wasn‚Äôt out of his head, and he believed something might happen tonight, and that small possibility made it wise to take precautions. Then as a car approached, Jonathan felt a start of real fear, an impulse to run straight into the house. The car went by at a fast clip. Jonathan hadn‚Äôt even a glimpse of it through the bushes and the house gates. He leaned a shoulder against a slender trunk of something and began to feel sleepy. Five minutes later, he lay at full length on his back, but still quite awake, beginning to feel the chill of the earth penetrating his shoulder blades. If the telephone rang again, it might well be Simone. He wondered if she would, in some frenzy of temper, come to Tom‚Äôs house in a taxi? Or would she ring her brother G√©rard in Nemours and ask him to bring her in his car? A bit more likely. Jonathan stopped thinking about that possibility, because it was so awful. Ludicrous. Unthinkable. How would he explain lying outside the house in the shrubbery, even if he concealed the rifle?

Jonathan heard the house door opening. He had been dozing.

‚ÄúTake this blanket,‚Äù Tom whispered. The road was empty, and Tom stepped out with a steamer rug and handed it to Jonathan. ‚ÄúPut it under you. That ground must be awful.‚Äù Tom‚Äôs own whispering made him realize that the Mafia boys might sneak up on foot. He hadn‚Äôt thought of that before. He went back into the house without another word to Jonathan.

Tom went up the stairs, and in the dark surveyed the situation from the windows, front and back. All looked calm. A streetlight glowed brightly, but without extending its light very far, on the road about a hundred yards to the left in the direction of the village. None of its light fell in front of Belle Ombre, as Tom knew well. It was extremely silent, but that was normal. Even the footsteps of a man walking on the road might have been heard through the closed windows, Tom thought. He wished he could put on some music. He was about to turn from the window, when he heard the faint crunch-crunch-crunch of someone walking on the dirt road, and then he saw a not very strong flashlight beam, moving from the right toward Belle Ombre. Tom felt sure this wasn‚Äôt a person who would turn in at Belle Ombre, and the figure didn‚Äôt, but went on and was lost to view before it reached the streetlight. Male or female, Tom couldn‚Äôt tell.

Jonathan was perhaps hungry. That couldn‚Äôt be helped. Tom was hungry, too. But of course it could be helped. Tom went down the stairs, still in the dark, his fingertips on the banister, and into the kitchen‚Äîthe living room and kitchen were lighted‚Äîand made some caviar canap√©s. The caviar was left over from last night, in its jar in the fridge, so the job was quick. Tom was bringing the plate for Jonathan, when he heard the purr of a car. The car went past Belle Ombre from left to right, and stopped. Then there was the feeble click of a car door, the sound of a car door when it hadn‚Äôt quite closed. Tom set the plate down on the wooden chest by the door, and pulled out his gun.

Steps crunched firmly, at a polite-sounding pace, on the road, then the gravel. This wasn‚Äôt a bomb-thrower, Tom thought. The doorbell rang. Tom waited a few seconds, then said in French, ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI would like to ask a direction, please,‚Äù the man‚Äôs voice said with a perfect French accent.

Jonathan had been crouching with the rifle since the approach of footsteps, and now he leapt out of the bushes just as he heard Tom slide the bolt of the door. The man was two steps up from Jonathan, but Jonathan was almost as tall nevertheless, and he swung his rifle butt with all his power at the man‚Äôs head‚Äîwhich had turned just slightly toward Jonathan, because the man must have heard him. Jonathan‚Äôs blow caught him behind the left ear, just under the hat brim. The man swayed, bumped the left side of the doorway, and dropped.

Tom opened the door and dragged him by the feet into the house, Jonathan helping, lifting the man‚Äôs shoulders. Then Jonathan recovered the rifle and came in the door, which Tom closed softly. Tom picked up the piece of firewood and walloped the man‚Äôs blondish head with it. The man‚Äôs hat had fallen off and lay upside down on the marble floor. Tom extended his hand for the rifle, and Jonathan handed it to Tom. Tom came down with the steel butt of it on the man‚Äôs temple.

Jonathan couldn‚Äôt believe his eyes. Blood flowed onto the white marble. This was the husky bodyguard with crinkly blond hair who had been so upset on the train.

‚ÄúGot that bastard!‚Äù Tom whispered with satisfaction. ‚ÄúThis is that bodyguard. Look at the gun!‚Äù

A gun had fallen half out of the man‚Äôs right side jacket pocket.

‚ÄúFarther into the living room,‚Äù Tom said, and they hauled and pushed the man across the floor. ‚ÄúMind the rug with that blood!‚Äù Tom kicked the rug out of the way. ‚ÄúNext guy‚Äôs due in a minute, no doubt. Bound to be two, maybe three.‚Äù

Tom took a handkerchief‚Äîlavender, monogrammed‚Äîfrom the man‚Äôs breast pocket and tidied a splotch of blood on the floor near the door. He kicked the man‚Äôs hat and sent it flying over the body, and it fell near the hall door to the kitchen. Then Tom bolted the front door, holding his left hand over the bolt so it would not make a noise. ‚ÄúNext one might not be so easy,‚Äù he whispered.

There were footsteps on gravel. The bell rang‚Äînervously twice.

Tom laughed without making a sound, and pulled his Luger. He motioned for Jonathan to take his gun also. Tom was suddenly convulsed, and doubled over to repress his mirth, then straightened and grinned at Jonathan, and wiped the tears from his eyes.

Jonathan didn‚Äôt smile.

The bell rang again, a long steady peal.

Jonathan saw Tom‚Äôs face change in a split-second. Tom frowned, grimaced, as if he didn‚Äôt know what he should do.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use the gun,‚Äù Tom whispered, ‚Äúunless you have to.‚Äù His left hand was extended toward the door.

Tom was going to open the door and fire, Jonathan supposed, or cover the man.

Then steps crunched again. The man outside was walking toward the window behind Jonathan, a window now quite covered by the curtains. Jonathan edged away from the window.

‚ÄúAngy?‚Äî Angy!‚Äù the man‚Äôs voice whispered.

‚ÄúAsk him at the door what he wants,‚Äù Tom whispered. ‚ÄúTalk in English‚Äîas if you were the butler. Let him in. I‚Äôll have him covered.‚ÄîCan you do it?‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt care to think whether he could or not. Now there was a knocking, then another ring of the bell. ‚ÄúWho is it, please?‚Äù Jonathan called to the door.

‚ÄúJe‚Äîje voudrais demander mon chemin, s‚Äôil vous pla√Æt.‚Äù The accent was not so good.

Tom smirked.

‚ÄúWhom did you wish to speak to, sir?‚Äù Jonathan asked.

‚ÄúUne direction!‚Äî S‚Äôil vous plait!‚Äù the voice yelled. Desperation had entered in.

Tom and Jonathan exchanged a glance, and Tom gestured for Jonathan to open the door. Tom was immediately to the left of the door to anyone standing outside, but out of sight if the door were opened.

Jonathan slid the bolt, turned the knob of the automatic lock, and opened the door partway, fully expecting a bullet in his abdomen, but he stood tall and stiffly with his right hand in his jacket pocket on the gun.

The somewhat shorter Italian, wearing a hat like the other man, also had his hand in his pocket and was plainly surprised to see a tall man in ordinary clothes in front of him.

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù Jonathan noticed that the man‚Äôs left jacket sleeve was empty.

As the man took a step inside the house, Tom poked him in the side with his Luger.

‚ÄúGive me your gun!‚Äù Tom said in Italian.

Jonathan‚Äôs gun was also pointed at him now. The man heaved his jacket pocket up as if to fire, and Tom pushed him in the face with his left hand. The man didn‚Äôt fire. The Italian looked paralyzed at finding himself suddenly so close to Tom Ripley.

‚ÄúReeply!‚Äù the Italian said, in a tone of mingled terror, surprise, and maybe triumph.

‚ÄúOh, never mind that and give us the gun!‚Äù Tom said in English, poking the man again in the ribs and knocking the door shut with his foot.

The Italian got the idea, at least. He dropped the gun on the floor, when Tom indicated that that was what he wanted. Then the Italian saw his chum on the floor yards away, and started, wide-eyed.

‚ÄúBolt the door,‚Äù Tom said to Jonathan. Then Tom said in Italian, ‚ÄúAny more of you?‚Äù

The Italian shook his head vigorously, which meant nothing, Tom thought. Tom saw that his arm was in a sling under his jacket. So much for the newspaper reports.

‚ÄúCover him while I do this,‚Äù Tom said, beginning to frisk the Italian. ‚ÄúOff with your jacket!‚Äù Tom took the man‚Äôs hat off and threw it in Angy‚Äôs direction.

The Italian let his jacket slide off and drop. His shoulder holster was empty. There were no weapons in his pockets.

‚ÄúAngy‚Äî‚Äù said the Italian.

‚ÄúAngy √® morto,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúSo will you be, if you don‚Äôt do what we say. You want to die? What‚Äôs your name?‚Äî What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúLippo. Filippo.‚Äù

‚ÄúLippo. Keep your hands up and don‚Äôt move. Your hand. Go stand over there.‚Äù He motioned for Lippo to go stand by the dead man. Lippo lifted his good right arm. ‚ÄúCover him, Jon, I want to have a look at their car.‚Äù

With his Luger ready, Tom went out and turned right on the road, approaching the car cautiously. He could hear the motor. The car was at the side of the road with parking lights on. Tom stopped and closed his eyes for a few seconds, then opened them wide, trying to see if there was any movement at the sides of the car or behind the back window. He advanced slowly and steadily, expecting possibly a shot from the car. Silence. Could they have sent only two men? Tom hadn‚Äôt brought a flashlight in his nervousness. With his gun pointed at someone who might be crouched in the front seat, Tom opened the left-side door. The interior light came on. The car was empty. Tom closed the door enough to shut the light off, stooped, and listened. He didn‚Äôt hear anything. Tom trotted back and opened the gates of Belle Ombre, then went back to the car and backed it in onto the gravel. A car passed just then on the road, coming from the village direction. Tom turned off the ignition and the parking lights. He knocked and announced himself to Jonathan.

‚ÄúIt seems this is all of them,‚Äù Tom said.

Jonathan was standing where Tom had seen him last, pointing his gun at Lippo, who now had his good arm down and hanging a little out from his side.

Tom smiled at Jonathan, then at Lippo. ‚ÄúAll alone now, Lippo? Because if you‚Äôre lying, it‚Äôs finito for you, you get me?‚Äù

Mafia pride seemed to be returning to Lippo, and he merely narrowed his eyes at Tom.

‚ÄúRisponde, you . . . !‚Äù

‚ÄúSi!‚Äù said Lippo, angry and scared.

‚ÄúGetting tired, Jonathan? Sit down.‚Äù Tom pulled up a yellow upholstered chair for him. ‚ÄúYou can sit down, too, if you want to,‚Äù Tom said to Lippo. ‚ÄúSit next to your pal.‚Äù Tom spoke in Italian. His slang was returning.

But Lippo remained standing. He was a bit over thirty, Tom supposed, about five feet ten, with round but strong shoulders and a paunch already starting, hopelessly dumb, not capo material. He had straight black hair, a pale olive face that was now faintly green.

‚ÄúRemember me from the train? A little bit?‚Äù Tom asked, smiling. He glanced at the blond hulk on the floor. ‚ÄúIf you behave well, Lippo, you won‚Äôt end up like Angy. All right?‚Äù Tom put his hands on his hips, and smiled at Jonathan. ‚ÄúSuppose we have a gin and tonic for fortification? You‚Äôre all right, Jonathan?‚Äù Jonathan‚Äôs color had returned, Tom saw.

Jonathan nodded with a tense smile. ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù

Tom went into the kitchen. While he was pulling out the ice tray, the telephone rang. ‚ÄúNever mind the phone, Jonathan!‚Äù

‚ÄúRight!‚Äù Jonathan had a feeling it was Simone again. It was now 9:45 p.m.

Tom was wondering how to force Lippo to get his chums off his trail. The telephone rang eight times and stopped. Tom had unconsciously counted the rings. He went into the living room with a tray of two glasses, ice, and an open tonic bottle. The gin was on the bar cart near the dining table.

Tom handed Jonathan his drink and said, ‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù He turned to Lippo. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your headquarters, Lippo? Milano?‚Äù

Lippo chose to maintain an insolent silence. What a bore, Lippo would have to be beaten up a little. Tom glanced with distaste at the splotch of drying blood under Angy‚Äôs head, set his glass down on the wooden chest by the door, and went back to the kitchen. He wet a sturdy floorcloth‚Äîcalled a torchon by Mme. Annette‚Äîand mopped up the blood from Mme. Annette‚Äôs waxed parquet. Tom pushed aside Angy‚Äôs head with his foot, and stuck the cloth under it. No more blood was coming, Tom thought. With sudden inspiration, Tom searched Angy‚Äôs pockets more thoroughly, trousers, jacket. He found cigarettes, a lighter, small change. A wallet in the breast pocket, which he left. There was a wadded handkerchief in a hip pocket, and when Tom pulled it out, a garrote came with it. ‚ÄúLook!‚Äù Tom said to Jonathan. ‚ÄúJust what I was wanting! Ah, these Mafia rosaries!‚Äù Tom held it up and laughed with pleasure. ‚ÄúFor you, Lippo, if you‚Äôre not a good boy,‚Äù Tom said in Italian. ‚ÄúAfter all, we don‚Äôt want to make any noise with guns, do we?‚Äù

Jonathan looked at the floor for a few seconds as Tom strolled toward Lippo. Tom was whirling the garrote around one finger.

‚ÄúYou are of the distinguished Genotti family, non √® vero, Lippo?‚Äù

Lippo hesitated, but very briefly, as if it only flitted across his mind to deny it. ‚ÄúSi,‚Äù he said firmly, with a trace of vergogna.

Tom was amused. Strength in number, in togetherness, the families had. Alone like this one, they turned yellow, or green. Tom was sorry about Lippo‚Äôs arm, but he wasn‚Äôt torturing him yet, and Tom knew the tortures the Mafia put its victims to if they didn‚Äôt come across with money or services‚Äîyanked toenails and teeth, cigarette burns. ‚ÄúHow many men have you killed, Lippo?‚Äù

‚ÄúNessuno!‚Äù cried Lippo.

‚ÄúNo one,‚Äù Tom said to Jonathan. ‚ÄúHa ha.‚Äù Tom went to rinse his hands in the little loo opposite the front door. Then he finished his drink, picked up the piece of log beside the front door, and approached Lippo with it. ‚ÄúLippo, you‚Äôre going to telephone your boss tonight. Maybe your new capo, eh? Where is he tonight? Milano? Monaco di Bavaria?‚Äù Tom gave Lippo a swat over the head with the wood, just to show he meant business, but the blow was fairly hard, because Tom was nervous.

‚ÄúStop it!‚Äù yelled Lippo, staggering up from a near collapse, one hand pitifully on top of his head. ‚ÄúMe a guy with one arm?‚Äù he shrieked, talking like himself now, the gutter Italian of Naples, Tom thought, though it could have been of Milan, because Tom was not an expert.

‚ÄúSissi! And two against one even!‚Äù Tom replied. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt play fair, eh? Is that your complaint?‚Äù Tom called him something unspeakable, and turned on his heel to get a cigarette. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you pray to the Virgin Mary?‚Äù Tom said over his shoulder. ‚ÄúAnother thing,‚Äù he said to Lippo in English, ‚Äúno more shouting or you‚Äôll get this over your head in no time flat!‚Äù He came down with the piece of firewood in the air‚Äîwhish!‚Äîto show what he meant. ‚ÄúThis is what killed Angy.‚Äù

Lippo blinked, his mouth slightly open. He was breathing shallowly and audibly.

Jonathan had finished his drink. He was holding the gun pointed at Lippo, holding it in two hands, because the gun had become heavy. He was not at all sure he could hit Lippo if he had to fire it, and anyway Tom was frequently between him and Lippo. Now Tom was shaking the Italian by his belt. Jonathan couldn‚Äôt understand all of what Tom was saying, some of it being in clipped Italian, the rest in French and in English. Tom was mostly muttering, but his voice finally rose in anger, and he shoved the Italian back and turned round. The Italian had hardly said anything.

Tom went to the radio, pressed a couple of buttons, and a cello concerto came on. Tom made the volume medium. Then he made sure the front curtains were completely closed. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this dreary,‚Äù Tom said apologetically to Jonathan. ‚ÄúSordid. He won‚Äôt tell me where his boss is, so I‚Äôve got to hit him a bit. Naturally he‚Äôs as afraid of his boss as he is of me.‚Äù Tom gave Jonathan a quick smile, and went and changed the music. He found some pop. Then he picked up the wood with determination.

Lippo brushed the first blow aside, but Tom bashed him in the temple with a backhand stroke. Lippo had yelped, and now he cried, ‚ÄúNo! Lasciame!‚Äù

‚ÄúYour boss‚Äôs number!‚Äù Tom yelled.

Crack! That was a swat at Lippo‚Äôs middle, which caught the hand Lippo had put there to protect himself. Glass particles fell on the floor. Lippo wore his watch on his right wrist, the watch must have been shattered, and Lippo held his hand in pain against his abdomen, while he looked at the glass on the floor. He gasped for breath.

Tom waited. The log was poised.

‚ÄúMilano!‚Äù Lippo said.

‚ÄúAll right, you‚Äôre going to‚Äî‚Äù

Jonathan missed the rest.

Tom was pointing to the telephone. Then Tom went to the table near the front windows where the telephone was and got a pencil and paper. He was asking the Italian the number in Milan.

Lippo gave a number and Tom wrote it down.

Then Tom made a longer speech, after which he turned to Jonathan and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told this guy he‚Äôs going to be garroted if he doesn‚Äôt ring his boss and tell him what I want him to say.‚Äù Tom adjusted the garrote for action, and as he turned to face Lippo, the sound of a car came from the road, the sound of a car stopping at the gates.

Jonathan stood up, thinking it was either Italian reinforcements or Simone in G√©rard‚Äôs car. Jonathan didn‚Äôt know which would be the worse fate, both seeming a death of sorts at that moment.

Tom didn‚Äôt want to part the curtains to look out. The motor purred on. Lippo‚Äôs face showed no change, no sign of relief that Tom could see.

Then the car moved on, toward the right. Tom looked between the curtains. The car was going on, very much on, and all was well, unless the car had let out a few men to hide in the bushes and fire through the windows. Tom listened for several seconds. It might have been the Grais, Tom thought, might have been the Grais who had telephoned a few minutes ago, and maybe they‚Äôd seen the strange car on the gravel inside the gates, and decided to go on, thinking the Ripleys had visitors.

‚ÄúNow, Lippo,‚Äù Tom said calmly, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to telephone our boss, and I‚Äôm going to listen with this little gadget.‚Äù Tom picked up the round earpiece that was clipped to the back of his telephone, which the French employed for the second ear to augment the sound. ‚ÄúAnd if anything doesn‚Äôt sound perfect to me,‚Äù Tom continued in French now, which he could see the Italian understood, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt hesitate to pull this suddenly tight, you see?‚Äù Tom illustrated with the noose around his wrist, then walked toward Lippo and flipped the garrote over Lippo‚Äôs head.

Lippo jerked back a little in surprise, then Tom led him forward like a dog on a leash toward the telephone. He pushed Lippo down in the chair there, so Tom was in a position to apply strength on the garrote.

‚ÄúNow I‚Äôll get the number for you, collect, I‚Äôm afraid. You will say you are in France, and you and Angy think you are being followed. You will say you have seen Tom Ripley, and Angy says he is not the man you were looking for. Right? Understand? Any funny words, code words and‚Äîthis‚Äî‚Äù Tom tightened the garrote, but not so tight that it disappeared in Lippo‚Äôs neck.

‚ÄúSissi!‚Äù said Lippo, staring in terror from Tom to the telephone.

Tom dialed the operator, and asked for the long-distance operator, for Milan, Italy. When the operator asked for his number, as French operators always did, Tom gave it.

‚ÄúFrom whom?‚Äù asked the operator.

‚ÄúLippo. Just Lippo,‚Äù Tom replied. Then he gave the number. The operator said she would ring Tom back. He said to Lippo, ‚ÄúIf this turns out to be a corner grocery or one of your girlfriends, I‚Äôll choke you just the same! Capish?‚Äù

Lippo squirmed, looking as if he were desperate to try something by way of escape, but as if he didn‚Äôt know what, as yet.

The telephone rang.

Tom motioned for Lippo to pick the telephone up. Tom took the earpiece and listened. The operator was saying that the call would be accepted.

‚ÄúPronto?‚Äù a male voice said at the other end.

Lippo held the telephone with his right hand to his left ear. ‚ÄúPronto. Lippo here. Luigi!‚Äù

‚ÄúSi,‚Äù said the other voice.

‚ÄúListen, I‚Äî‚Äù Lippo‚Äôs shirt was sticking to his back with sweat. ‚ÄúWe saw‚Äî‚Äù

Tom jerked the garrote a little to make Lippo get on with it.

‚ÄúYou are in France, no? With Angy?‚Äù the other voice said with some impatience. ‚ÄúAllora‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing. I‚Äî We saw this fellow. Angy says he is not the man . . . No . . .‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you think you are being followed,‚Äù Tom whispered, because the connection was not good, and he hadn‚Äôt any fear that the man in Milan could hear him.

‚ÄúAnd we think‚Äîmaybe we‚Äôre being followed.‚Äù

‚ÄúFollowed by who?‚Äù asked Milan sharply.

‚ÄúI dunno. So what the ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî should we do?‚Äù Lippo asked, in fluent argot with a word Tom didn‚Äôt understand. Lippo sounded genuinely scared now.

Tom‚Äôs ribs tensed with laughter, and he glanced at Jonathan, who was still dutifully covering Lippo with his gun. Tom could understand not quite all of what Lippo was saying, but Lippo didn‚Äôt seem to be pulling any tricks.

‚ÄúReturn?‚Äù said Lippo.

‚ÄúSi!‚Äù said Luigi. ‚ÄúAbandon the car! Take a taxi to the nearest airport! Where are you now?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell him you‚Äôve got to hang up,‚Äù Tom whispered, gesturing.

‚ÄúGot to sign off. Rivederch, Luigi,‚Äù said Lippo and hung up. He looked up at Tom with eyes like a miserable dog‚Äôs.

Lippo was finished and he knew it, Tom thought. For once Tom was proud of his reputation. Tom had no intention of sparing Lippo‚Äôs life. Lippo‚Äôs family wouldn‚Äôt have spared anyone‚Äôs life under the circumstances.

‚ÄúStand up, Lippo,‚Äù Tom said, smiling. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what else you‚Äôve got in your pockets.‚Äù

When Tom started to search him, Lippo‚Äôs good arm twitched back as if to strike him, but Tom didn‚Äôt bother ducking. Just nerves, Tom thought. Tom felt coins in one pocket, a crumpled bit of paper which on inspection turned out to be a decrepit strip of Italian tram ticket, then in the hip pocket a garrote, this one a sportif red-and-white striped cord that reminded Tom of a barber‚Äôs pole, fine as catgut, and Tom thought it was.

‚ÄúLook at this! Still another!‚Äù Tom said to Jonathan, holding up the garrote as if it were a pretty pebble he had found on a beach.

Jonathan barely glanced at the dangling string. The first garrote was still around Lippo‚Äôs neck. Jonathan did not look at the dead man who was hardly two yards from him, one shoe turned inward in an unnatural way on the polished floor, but Jonathan kept seeing the prone figure in the margin of his vision.

‚ÄúMy goodness,‚Äù Tom said, looking at his watch. He hadn‚Äôt realized it was so late, after 10 p.m. It had to be done now, he and Jonathan had to drive hours‚Äô distance away and get back before sunup, if possible. They had to dispose of the corpses some distance from Villeperce. South, of course, in the direction of Italy. Southeast, perhaps. It didn‚Äôt really matter, but Tom preferred southeast. Tom took a deep breath, preparatory to action, but the presence of Jonathan inhibited him. However, Jonathan had seen corpses‚Äô removal before, and there was no time to lose. Tom picked up the wood from the floor.

Lippo dodged, flung himself on the floor, or tripped and fell, but Tom came down on his head, and again a second time, with the wood. At the same time, Tom had not put his full strength into it‚Äîthe thought of not getting more blood on Mme. Annette‚Äôs floors being in the back of his mind.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs only unconscious,‚Äù Tom said to Jonathan. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got to be finished, and if you don‚Äôt want to see it‚Äîgo in the kitchen, perhaps.‚Äù

Jonathan had stood up. He definitely didn‚Äôt want to see it.

‚ÄúCan you drive?‚Äù Tom asked. ‚ÄúMy car, I mean. The Renault.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Jonathan said. He had a license from the early days in France with Roy, his chum from England, but the license was at home.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to drive tonight. Go in the kitchen.‚Äù Tom motioned Jonathan away. Then Tom bent to his task of pulling the garrote tight, not a pleasant task‚Äîthe trite phrase crossed his mind‚Äîbut what about people who hadn‚Äôt the merciful anesthetic, unconsciousness? Tom held the cord tight, the cord had disappeared in flesh, and Tom fortified himself with the thought of Vito Marcangelo succumbing on the Mozart Express by the same means: Tom had brought that job off, and this was his second.

He heard a car, tentative on the road, then rolling up, stopping, with a pull of the handbrake.

Tom kept his grip exactly the same on the garrote. How many seconds had passed? Forty-five? Not more than a minute, unfortunately.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Jonathan whispered, coming in from the kitchen.

The motor of the car was still running.

Tom shook his head.

They both heard light footsteps trotting on the gravel, then a knock at the door. Jonathan felt suddenly weak, as if his knees would give way.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs Simone,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Tom desperately hoped that Lippo was dead. Lippo‚Äôs face looked merely dark pink. Damn him!

The knock came again. ‚ÄúM. Ripley?‚Äî Jon!‚Äù

‚ÄúAsk her who‚Äôs with her,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúIf she‚Äôs with somebody, we can‚Äôt open the door. Tell her we‚Äôre busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you with, Simone?‚Äù Jonathan asked through the closed door.

‚ÄúNo one!‚Äî I‚Äôve told the taxi to wait. What is happening, Jon?‚Äù

Jonathan saw that Tom had heard what she said.

‚ÄúTell her to get rid of the taxi,‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúPay off the taxi, Simone,‚Äù Jonathan called.

‚ÄúHe is paid!‚Äù

‚ÄúTell him to leave.‚Äù

Simone went away toward the road to do this. They heard the taxi drive off. Simone came back, up the steps, and this time she didn‚Äôt knock, only waited.

Tom straightened up from Lippo, leaving the garrote on him. Tom was wondering if Jonathan could go out and explain to her that she couldn‚Äôt come into the house? That they had other people? That they would send for another taxi for her? Tom was thinking of the taxi driver‚Äôs impressions. Best to have dismissed this one, rather than not show signs of letting Simone into a house that plainly had lights and at least one person in it.

‚ÄúJon!‚Äù she called. ‚ÄúWill you open the door? I would like to speak with you.‚Äù

Tom said softly, ‚ÄúCan you wait with her outside while I ring for another taxi? Tell her we‚Äôre talking business with a couple of other people.‚Äù

Jonathan nodded, hesitated an instant, then slid back the bolt. He opened the door not widely, intending to slip out himself, but Simone thrust the door against him suddenly. She was in the foyer.

‚ÄúJon! I am sorry to‚Äî‚Äù Breathless, she glanced around as if looking for Tom Ripley, master of the house, then she saw him, and at the same time saw the two men on the floor. She gave a short cry. Her handbag slipped from her fingers and dropped with a soft thud on the marble. ‚ÄúMon dieu!‚Äî What is happening here?‚Äù

Jonathan gripped one of her hands tightly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at them. These‚Äî‚Äù

Simone stood rigid.

Tom walked toward her. ‚ÄúGood evening, madame. Don‚Äôt be frightened. These men were invading the house. They are unconscious. We had a bit of trouble!‚Äî Jonathan, take Simone into the kitchen.‚Äù

Simone didn‚Äôt walk. She was swaying, and leaned against Jonathan for a moment, then lifted her head and looked at Tom with hysterical eyes. ‚ÄúThey look dead!‚Äî Murderers! C‚Äôest √©pouvantable!‚Äî Jonathan! I cannot believe that it is you‚Äîhere!‚Äù

Tom was going to the bar cart. ‚ÄúCan Simone take some brandy, do you think?‚Äù he called to Jonathan.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äî We‚Äôll go in the kitchen, Simone.‚Äù He was prepared to walk between her and the corpses, but she wouldn‚Äôt move.

Tom, finding the brandy more difficult than the whiskey to open, poured whiskey into one of the glasses on the cart. He took it to Simone, neat. ‚ÄúMadame, I realize this is dreadful. These men are of the Mafia‚ÄîItalians. They came to the house to attack us‚Äîme, anyway.‚Äù Tom was much relieved to see that she was sipping the whiskey, barely grimacing, as if it were medicine that was good for her. ‚ÄúJonathan helped me, for which I‚Äôm very grateful. Without him‚Äî‚Äù Tom stopped. Anger was rising again in Simone.

‚ÄúWithout him? What is he doing here?‚Äù

Tom stood straighter. He went into the kitchen himself, thinking it the only way to draw her from the living room. She and Jonathan followed him. ‚ÄúThat I can‚Äôt explain tonight, Madame Trevanny. Not now. We‚Äôve got to leave now‚Äîwith these men. Would you‚Äî‚Äù Tom was thinking, had they time, had he time to take her back to Fontainebleau in the Renault, then return to remove the corpses with Jonathan‚Äôs assistance? No. Tom absolutely didn‚Äôt want to waste that much time, which would mean a good forty minutes. ‚ÄúMadame, shall I ring for a taxi to take you back to Fontainebleau?‚Äù

‚ÄúI will not leave my husband. I want to know what my husband is doing here‚Äîwith such filth as you!‚Äù

Her fury was directed entirely against him. Tom wished it could all come out now and forever, in a great burst. He could never deal with angry women‚Äînot that he had to deal with many. To Tom it was a circular chaos, a ring of little fires, and if he successfully extinguished one, the woman‚Äôs mind leapt to the next. Tom said to Jonathan, ‚ÄúIf Simone could only take a taxi back to Fontainebleau‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know. Simone, it really is best if you go back to our house.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you come with me?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Jonathan said, desperate.

‚ÄúThen you don‚Äôt want to. You are on his side.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll let me talk with you later, darling‚Äî‚Äù

Jonathan went on in that vein, while Tom thought, perhaps Jonathan wasn‚Äôt willing, or had changed his mind. Jonathan was getting nowhere with Simone. Tom interrupted:

‚ÄúJonathan.‚Äù Tom beckoned to him. ‚ÄúYou must excuse us a moment, madame.‚Äù Tom spoke with Jonathan in the living room, in a whisper. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got six hours‚Äô work ahead‚Äîor I have. I‚Äôve got to take these two away and dispose of them‚Äîand I‚Äôd prefer to be back by dawn or before. Are you really willing to help?‚Äù

Jonathan felt lost in the sense that he might be lost in the middle of a battle. But the situation seemed already lost in regard to Simone. He could never explain. Going back to Fontainebleau with her would gain him nothing. He had lost Simone, and what else was there to lose? These thoughts flashed in Jonathan‚Äôs mind like a single image. ‚ÄúI am willing, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äî Thanks.‚Äù Tom gave a tense smile. ‚ÄúSurely Simone doesn‚Äôt want to stay here. She could of course stay in my wife‚Äôs room. Maybe I can find a sedative. But for Christ‚Äôs sake, she can‚Äôt come with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Simone was his responsibility. Jonathan felt powerless either to persuade or command. ‚ÄúI have never been able to tell her‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some danger,‚Äù Tom interrupted, then stopped. There was no time to lose in talking, and he went back into the living room, felt compelled to glance at Lippo, whose face was now bluish, or so Tom thought. At any rate, his clumsy body had that abandoned look of the dead‚Äînot even dreamlike or sleeplike, but simply an empty look as if consciousness had departed forever. Simone was coming in from the kitchen, which Tom had been heading for, and he saw that her glass was empty. He went to the bar cart and brought the bottle. He poured more into the glass in her hand, though Simone indicated that she didn‚Äôt want any more. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to drink it, madame,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúSince we must leave, I must tell you there is some danger if you stay in this house. I simply don‚Äôt know if more of these won‚Äôt turn up.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I will go with you. I will go with my husband!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat you cannot, madame.‚Äù Tom was firm.

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, but we have to get rid of these‚Äîthis carrion!‚Äù Tom gestured. ‚ÄúCharogne!‚Äù he repeated.

‚ÄúSimone, you have got to take a taxi back to Fontainebleau,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúNon!‚Äù

Jonathan grabbed her wrist, and with his other hand took the glass, so it wouldn‚Äôt spill. ‚ÄúYou must do as I say. It‚Äôs your life, It‚Äôs my life. We cannot stay and argue!‚Äù

Tom leapt up the stairs. He found, after nearly a minute‚Äôs searching, Heloise‚Äôs little bottle of quarter-grain phenobarbitols, which she so seldom took that they were at the back of everything in her medicine cabinet. He went down with two in his fingers, and dropped them casually into Simone‚Äôs glass‚Äîwhich he had taken from Jonathan‚Äîas he topped the glass up with a splash of soda.

Simone drank this. She was sitting on the yellow sofa now. She seemed calmer, though it was too soon for the pills to have taken effect. And Jonathan was on the telephone now, Tom presumed phoning for a taxi. The slender Seine-et-Marne directory was open on the telephone table. Tom felt a little dazed, the way Simone looked. But Simone looked also stunned with shock.

‚ÄúJust Belle Ombre, Villeperce,‚Äù said Tom when Jonathan glanced at him.





20


While Jonathan and Simone waited for the taxi, both standing in terrible silence near the front door, Tom went out to the garden via the French windows, and from the toolhouse got the jerry can of spare petrol. To Tom‚Äôs regret it was not full, but it felt three-quarters full. Tom had his flashlight with him. When he came round the front corner of the house, he heard a car approaching slowly, the taxi, he hoped. Tom, instead of putting the jerry can in the Renault, set it in the laurels, out of sight. He knocked on the front door and was admitted by Jonathan.

‚ÄúI think the taxi‚Äôs here,‚Äù Tom said.

Tom said good night to Simone, and let Jonathan escort her to the taxi, which was waiting beyond the gates. The taxi drove off, and Jonathan came back.

Tom was refastening the French windows. ‚ÄúGood Christ,‚Äù Tom said, not knowing what else to say, and being immensely relieved to find himself alone with Jonathan again. ‚ÄúI hope Simone isn‚Äôt too livid. But I can hardly blame her.‚Äù

Jonathan shrugged in a dazed way. He tried to speak and couldn‚Äôt.

Tom realized his state and said, like a captain giving orders to a shaken crew, ‚ÄúJonathan, she‚Äôll come round.‚Äù And she wouldn‚Äôt ring the police either, because if she did, her husband would be implicated. Tom‚Äôs fortitude, his sense of purpose was returning. He patted Jonathan‚Äôs arm as he walked past him. ‚ÄúBack in a minute.‚Äù

Tom got the jerry can from the bushes and put it in the back of his Renault. Then he opened the Italians‚Äô Citro√´n, the interior light came on, and he saw that the fuel gauge registered slightly over half full. That might do: he wanted to drive for more than two hours. The Renault, he knew, had only slightly more than half a tankful, and the bodies were going to be in there. He and Jonathan hadn‚Äôt had any dinner. That wasn‚Äôt wise. Tom went back into the house and said:

‚ÄúWe ought to eat something before this trip.‚Äù

Jonathan followed Tom into the kitchen, glad to escape for a few moments from the corpses in the living room. He washed his hands and face at the kitchen sink. Tom smiled at him. Food, that was the answer‚Äîfor the moment. He got the steak from the fridge and stuck it under the glowing bars. Then he found a plate, a couple of steak knives, and two forks. They sat down finally, eating from the same plate, dipping morsels of steak into a saucer of salt and another of HP. It was excellent steak. Tom had even found a half-full bottle of claret on the kitchen counter. There‚Äôd been many a time when he‚Äôd dined worse.

‚ÄúThat will do you good,‚Äù Tom said, and tossed his knife and fork onto the plate.

The clock in the living room gave a ping, and Tom knew it was 11:30 p.m.

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù asked Tom. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Nescaf√©.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thanks.‚Äù Neither Jonathan nor Tom had spoken while they had bolted the steak. Now Jonathan said, ‚ÄúHow are we going to do it?‚Äù

‚ÄúBurn them somewhere. In their car,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt necessary to burn them, but it‚Äôs rather Mafia-like.‚Äù

Jonathan watched Tom rinsing a thermos at the sink, careless now of the fact he stood before an open window. Tom was running the hot water. He tipped some of the jar of Nescaf√© into the thermos and filled it with steaming water.

‚ÄúLike sugar?‚Äù Tom asked. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll need it.‚Äù

Then Jonathan was helping Tom carry out the blond man, who was now stiffening. Tom was saying something, making a joke. Then Tom said he had changed his mind: both bodies were going into the Citro√´n.

‚Äú. . . even though the Renault,‚Äù Tom said between gasps, ‚Äúis bigger.‚Äù

It was dark in front of the house now, the distant streetlamp not even shedding a glow this far. They tumbled the second body onto the first on the backseat of the Citro√´n convertible, and Tom smiled because Lippo‚Äôs face seemed to be buried in Angy‚Äôs neck, but he refrained from comment. He found a couple of newspapers on the floor of the car and spread them over the dead men, tucking them in as best he could. Tom made sure that Jonathan knew how the Renault worked, showed him the turn signals, the headlights, and the bright lights.

‚ÄúOkay, start it. I‚Äôll close the house.‚Äù Tom went into the house, left one light on in the living room, came out, and closed the front door and double-locked it.

Tom had explained to Jonathan that their first objective was Sens, then Troyes. From Troyes they would go farther eastward. Tom had a map in his car. They would rendezvous first at Sens at the railway station. Tom put the thermos in Jonathan‚Äôs car.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre feeling all right?‚Äù Tom asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hesitate to stop and drink some coffee if you feel like it.‚Äù Tom waved him a cheerful good-bye. ‚ÄúGo ahead out first. I want to close the gates. I‚Äôll pass you.‚Äù

So Jonathan drove out first, Tom closed his gates and padlocked them, then soon passed Jonathan on the way to Sens, which was only thirty minutes away. Jonathan seemed to be doing all right in the Renault. Tom spoke briefly to him at Sens. At Troyes, they were again to go to the railway station. Tom didn‚Äôt know the town, and on the road it was dangerous for one car to try to follow another, but the way to ‚ÄúLa Gare‚Äù was pretty well marked in every town.

It was about 1 a.m. when Tom got to Troyes. He hadn‚Äôt seen Jonathan behind him for more than half an hour. He went into the station caf√© for a coffee, a second coffee, and kept a lookout through the glass door for the Renault which might pull into the parking area in front of the station. Finally Tom paid and went out, and as he walked toward his own car, his Renault came down the slope into the parking area. Tom gave a wave, and Jonathan saw him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all right?‚Äù Tom asked. Jonathan looked all right to Tom. ‚ÄúIf you want some coffee here, or to use the loo, best go in alone.‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt want either. Tom persuaded him to drink some coffee out of the thermos. No one was giving them a glance, Tom saw. A train had just come in and ten or fifteen people were heading for their parked cars or to the cars of people who had come to meet them.

‚ÄúFrom here we take the National Nineteen,‚Äù Tom said. We‚Äôll aim for Bar‚ÄîBar-sur-Aube‚Äîand meet again at the railway station. All right?‚Äù

Tom started off. The highway became clearer, with very little traffic except two or three elephantine trucks, their rectangular rears outlined in white or red lights, moving forms which might have been blind, Tom felt, blind at least to the two corpses in the back of the Citro√´n under newspaper, such a tiny cargo compared to theirs. Tom was not going fast now, not more than ninety kilometers, or around fifty-five miles per hour. At the Bar railway station he and Jonathan leaned out of their windows to speak with one another.

‚ÄúPetrol‚Äôs getting low,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI want to go beyond Chaumont, so I‚Äôm going to pull in at the next petrol station, okay? And you do the same.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù said Jonathan.

It was now 2:15 a.m. ‚ÄúKeep on the old N. Nineteen. See you at the railway station in Chaumont.‚Äù

Tom pulled in at a Total station as he was leaving Bar. He was paying the man, when Jonathan drove in behind him. Tom lit a cigarette and didn‚Äôt glance at Jonathan. Tom was walking about, stretching his legs. Then he pulled his car a little aside and went to the toilet. It was only forty-two kilometers to Chaumont.

And there Tom arrived at 2:55 a.m. Not even a taxi stood at the railway station, only a few parked and empty cars. There were no more trains tonight. The station bar-caf√© was closed. When Jonathan arrived, Tom approached the Renault on foot, and said:

‚ÄúFollow me. I‚Äôm going to look for a quiet spot.‚Äù

Jonathan was tired, but his fatigue had switched into another gear: he could have gone on driving for hours more, he felt. The Renault handled tightly and quickly, with the minimum of effort on his part. Jonathan was totally unfamiliar with the country here. That didn‚Äôt matter. And now it was easy, he merely kept the red taillights of the Citro√´n in view. Tom was going more slowly, and twice paused tentatively at side roads, then went on. The night was black, the stars not visible, at least not with the glow of the dashboard before him. A couple of cars passed, going in the opposite direction, and one truck overtook Jonathan. Then Jonathan saw Tom‚Äôs right indicator pulse, and Tom‚Äôs car disappeared to the right. Jonathan followed, and barely saw the black gorge that was the road, or lane, when he came to it. It was a dirt road that led at once into forest. The road was narrow, not wide enough for two cars to pass, the kind of road often found in the French countryside, used by farmers or men gathering wood. Bushes scraped delicately at the front fenders, and there were potholes.

Tom‚Äôs car stopped. They had gone perhaps two hundred yards from the main road in a great curve. Tom had cut his lights, but the interior of the car lit when he opened the door. Tom left the door open, and walked toward Jonathan, waving his arms cheerfully. Jonathan was at that instant cutting his own motor and his lights. The image of Tom‚Äôs figure in the baggy trousers, green suede jacket, stayed in Jonathan‚Äôs eyes for a moment as if Tom had been composed of light. Jonathan blinked.

Then Tom was beside Jonathan‚Äôs window. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be over in a couple of minutes. Back your car about fifteen feet. You know how to reverse?‚Äù

Jonathan started the car. The car had backing lights. When he stopped, Tom opened the second door of the Renault and pulled out the jerry can. Tom had his flashlight.

Tom poured petrol onto the newspapers over the two corpses, then on their clothing. Tom splashed some on the roof, then the upholstery‚Äîunfortunately plastic, not cloth‚Äîof the front seat also. Tom looked up, straight up where the branches of the trees almost closed together above the road‚Äîyoung leaves, not yet in their fullness of summer. A few would get singed, but it was for a worthy cause. Tom shook the last drops from the jerry can onto the floor of the car where there was rubbish, the remains of a sandwich, an old road map.

Jonathan was walking slowly toward him.

‚ÄúHere we go,‚Äù Tom said softly, and struck a match. He had left the front door of the car open. He flung the match into the back of the car, where the newspapers flared up yellow at once.

Tom stepped back, and grabbed Jonathan‚Äôs hand as his foot slipped in a depression at the side of the road. ‚ÄúIn the car!‚Äù Tom whispered, and trotted toward the Renault. He got into the driver‚Äôs seat, smiling. The Citro√´n was taking nicely. The roof had started to burn in one central, thin yellow flame, like a candle.

Jonathan got in on the other side.

Tom started his motor. He was breathing a little hard, but it soon became laughter. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs all right. Don‚Äôt you? I think that‚Äôs just great!‚Äù

The Renault‚Äôs lights burst forward, diminishing the growing holocaust in front of them for an instant. Tom backed, fairly fast, his body twisted so he could see through the back window.

Jonathan stared at the burning car, which completely disappeared as they backed along the curve in the road.

Then Tom straightened out. They were on the main road.

‚ÄúCan you see it from here?‚Äù Tom asked, shooting the car forward.

Jonathan saw a light like that of a glowworm through the trees, then it vanished. Or had he imagined it? ‚ÄúNot a thing now. No.‚Äù For an instant, Jonathan felt frightened by this fact‚Äîas if they had failed somehow, as if the fire had died out. But he knew it hadn‚Äôt. The woods had simply swallowed the fire up, hidden it utterly. And yet, someone would find it. When? How much of it?

Tom laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs burning. They‚Äôll burn! We‚Äôre in the clear!‚Äù

Jonathan saw Tom glance at his speedometer, which was climbing to a hundred and thirty. Then Tom eased back to a hundred.

Tom was whistling a Neapolitan tune. He felt well, not tired at all, not even in need of a cigarette. Life afforded few pleasures tantamount to disposing of Mafiosi. And yet‚Äî

‚ÄúAnd yet‚Äî‚Äù Tom said cheerfully.

‚ÄúAnd yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúDisposing of two does so little. Like stepping on two cockroaches when the whole house is full of them. I believe, however, in making the effort, and above all it‚Äôs nice to let the Mafia know now and then that people can diminish them. Unfortunately in this case they‚Äôre going to think another family got Lippo and Angy. At least I hope they‚Äôll think that.‚Äù

Jonathan was now feeling sleepy. He fought against it, forcing himself to sit up, pressing his nails into his palm. My God, he thought, it was going to be hours before they got home‚Äîback to Tom‚Äôs or to his own house. Tom seemed fresh as a daisy, singing now in Italian a tune he‚Äôd been whistling before.

. . . papa ne meno

Como faremo fare l‚Äôamor . . .

Tom was chatting on, about his wife now, who was going to stay with some friends in a chalet in Switzerland. Then Jonathan awakened a little as Tom said:

‚ÄúPut your head back, Jonathan. No need to stay awake.‚ÄîYou‚Äôre feeling all right, I hope?‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt know how he was feeling. He felt a bit weak, but he often felt weak. Jonathan was afraid to think about what had just happened, about what was happening, flesh and bone being burnt, smoldering on hours from now. Sadness came over Jonathan suddenly, like an eclipse. He wished he could erase the last few hours, cut them out of his memory. Yet he had been there, he had acted, he had helped. Jonathan put his head back and fell half asleep. Tom was talking cheerfully, casually, as if he were having a conversation with someone who now and then replied to him. Jonathan had in fact never known Tom in such good spirits. Jonathan was wondering what he was going to say to Simone? Merely to be aware of that problem exhausted him.

‚ÄúMasses sung in English, you know,‚Äù Tom was saying, ‚ÄúI find simply embarrassing. Somehow one gives the English-speaking people credit for believing what they‚Äôre saying, so a mass in English. . . . you feel either the choir has lost its mind or they‚Äôre a pack of liars. Don‚Äôt you agree? Sir John Stainer . . .‚Äù

Jonathan woke up when the car stopped. Tom had pulled onto the edge of the road. Smiling, Tom was sipping coffee from the thermos cup. He offered some to Jonathan. Jonathan drank a little. Then they drove on.

Dawn came over a village that Jonathan had never seen before. The light had awakened Jonathan.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only twenty minutes from home!‚Äù Tom said brightly.

Jonathan murmured something, and half shut his eyes again. Now Tom was talking about the harpsichord, his harpsichord.

‚ÄúThe thing about Bach is that he‚Äôs instantly civilizing. Just a phrase . . .‚Äù





21


Jonathan opened his eyes, thinking he had heard harpsichord music. Yes. It wasn‚Äôt a dream. He hadn‚Äôt really been asleep. The music came from downstairs. It faltered, recommenced. A sarabande, perhaps. Jonathan lifted his arm wearily and looked at his wristwatch: 8:38 a.m. What was Simone doing now? What was she thinking?

Exhaustion sucked at Jonathan‚Äôs will. He sank deeper into the pillow, retreating. He‚Äôd taken a warm shower, put on pajamas at Tom‚Äôs insistence. Tom had given him a new toothbrush and said, ‚ÄúGet a couple of hours‚Äô sleep, anyway. It‚Äôs terribly early.‚Äù That had been around 7 a.m. He had to get up. He had to do something about Simone, had to speak to her. But Jonathan lay limp, listening to the single notes of the harpsichord.

Now Tom was fingering the bass of something, and it sounded correct, the deepest notes a harpsichord could pluck. As Tom had said, instantly civilizing. Jonathan forced himself up, out of the pale-blue sheets and the darker-blue woolen blanket. He staggered, and with an effort stood straight as he walked toward the door. Jonathan went down the stairs barefoot.

Tom was reading the notes from a music book propped in front of him. Now the treble entered, and sunlight came through the slightly parted curtains at the French windows on to Tom‚Äôs left shoulder, picking out the gold pattern in his black dressing gown.

‚ÄúTom?‚Äù

Tom turned at once and got up. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

Jonathan felt worse, seeing Tom‚Äôs alarmed face. The next thing Jonathan knew, he was on the yellow sofa, and Tom was wiping his face with a wet cloth, a dishtowel.

‚ÄúTea? Or a brandy? . . . Have you got any pills you take?‚Äù

Jonathan felt awful, he knew the feeling, and the only thing that helped was a transfusion. It hadn‚Äôt been so long since he‚Äôd had one. The trouble now was that he felt worse than he usually did. Was it only from losing a night‚Äôs sleep?

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd better get to the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go,‚Äù said Tom. He went away and came back with a stemmed glass. ‚ÄúThis is brandy and water, if you feel like it. Stay there. I‚Äôll just be a minute.‚Äù

Jonathan closed his eyes. He had the wet towel over his forehead, down one cheek, and felt chilly and too tired to move. It seemed only a minute until Tom was back, dressed. Tom had brought Jonathan‚Äôs clothing.

‚ÄúMatter of fact, if you put on your shoes and my topcoat, you won‚Äôt have to dress,‚Äù Tom said.

Jonathan followed this advice. They were in the Renault again, heading for Fontainebleau, and Jonathan‚Äôs clothes were folded neatly between them. Tom was asking him if he knew exactly where they should go when they got to the hospital, if he could get a transfusion right away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to speak with Simone,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do that‚Äîor you will. Don‚Äôt worry about that now.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you bring her?‚Äù Jonathan asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Tom firmly. He hadn‚Äôt been worried about Jonathan until that instant. Simone would hate the sight of him, but she would come to see her husband, either with Tom or on her own. ‚ÄúYou still have no phone at your house?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Tom spoke to a receptionist in the hospital. She greeted Jonathan as if she knew him. Tom held Jonathan‚Äôs arm. When Tom had seen Jonathan into the charge of the proper doctor, Tom said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have Simone come, Jonathan. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù To the receptionist, who was in nurse‚Äôs uniform, Tom said, ‚ÄúDo you think a transfusion will do it?‚Äù

She nodded pleasantly, and Tom left it at that, not knowing whether she knew what she was talking about or not. He wished he‚Äôd asked the doctor. Tom got into his car and drove to the Rue St. Merry. He was able to park a few yards from the house, and he got out and walked toward the stone steps with the black handrails. He‚Äôd had no sleep, was in slight need of a shave, but at least he had a message that might be of interest to Mme. Trevanny. He rang the bell.

There was no answer. Tom rang again, and looked on the pavement for Simone. It was Sunday. No market in Fontainebleau, but she might well be out buying something at 9:50 a.m., or might be at church with Georges.

Tom went down the steps slowly, and as he reached the pavement, he saw Simone walking toward him, Georges beside her. Simone had a shopping basket over her forearm.

‚ÄúBonjour, madame,‚Äù Tom said politely, in the face of her bristling hostility. He continued, ‚ÄúI only wanted to bring you news of your husband.‚Äî Bonjour, Georges.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want nothing from you,‚Äù Simone said, ‚Äúexcept to know where my husband is.‚Äù

Georges stared at Tom alertly and neutrally. He had eyes and brows like his father. ‚ÄúHe is all right, I think, madame, but he is‚Äî‚Äù Tom hated saying it on the street. ‚ÄúHe is in the hospital for the moment. A transfusion, I think.‚Äù

Simone looked both exasperated and furious‚Äîas if Tom were to blame for it.

‚ÄúMay I please speak with you inside your house, madame. It is so much easier.‚Äù

After an instant‚Äôs hesitation, Simone agreed to this, out of curiosity, Tom felt. She unlocked the door with a key which she produced from her coat pocket. It wasn‚Äôt a new coat, Tom noticed. ‚ÄúWhat has happened to him?‚Äù she asked when they were in the little hall.

Tom took a breath and spoke calmly. ‚ÄúWe had to drive nearly all night. I think he is merely tired. But‚Äîof course I thought you would want to know. I‚Äôve just brought him to the hospital now. He‚Äôs able to walk. I do think he‚Äôs not in danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúPapa! I want to see Papa!‚Äù Georges said rather petulantly, as if he had asked for Papa last evening too.

Simone had set her basket down. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to my husband? He is not the same man I knew‚Äîsince he met you, m‚Äôsieur! If you see him again, I‚ÄîI will‚Äî‚Äù

It seemed only the presence of her son that kept her from saying that she would kill him, Tom thought.

She said with bitter control of herself, ‚ÄúWhy is he in your power?‚Äù

He is not in my power and never was. And I think now the job is finished,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite impossible to explain now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat job?‚Äù Simone asked. And before Tom could open his mouth, she continued, ‚ÄúM‚Äôsieur, you are a crook, and you corrupt other people! What sort of blackmail have you subjected him to? And why?‚Äù

Blackmail‚Äîthe French word chantage‚Äîwas so off the beam, Tom stammered as he began to reply. ‚ÄúMadame, no one is taking money from Jonathan. Or anything from him. Quite the contrary. And he has done nothing to give people power over him.‚Äù Tom spoke with genuine conviction, and he certainly had to, because Simone looked the picture of wifely virtue, probity, her fine eyes flashing, and her brows concentrated against him, powerful as the Winged Victory of Samothrace. ‚ÄúWe have spent the night cleaning things up.‚Äù Tom felt shabby saying that. His more eloquent French had suddenly deserted him. His words were no match for the virtuous helpmeet who stood before him.

‚ÄúCleaning what up?‚Äù She stooped to pick up her basket. ‚ÄúM‚Äôsieur, I will be grateful if you leave this house. I thank you informing me where my husband is.‚Äù

Tom nodded. ‚ÄúI would also be happy to take you and Georges to the hospital, if you like. My car is just outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúMerci, non.‚Äù She was standing midway in the hall, looking back, waiting for him to leave. ‚ÄúCome, Georges.‚Äù

Tom let himself out. He got into his car, thought of going to the hospital to ask how Jonathan was, because it would be at least ten minutes before Simone could get there either by taxi or on foot. But Tom decided to telephone from his house. He drove home. And once home, he decided not to telephone. By now Simone might be there. Hadn‚Äôt Jonathan said the transfusion took several hours? Tom hoped it wasn‚Äôt a crisis, that it wasn‚Äôt the beginning of the end.

He turned on France Musique for company, opened his curtains wider to the sunlight, and tidied the kitchen. He poured a glass of milk, went upstairs and got into pajamas again and went to bed. He could shave when he woke up.

Tom hoped that Jonathan could straighten things out with Simone. But it was the same old problem: how did the Mafia get tied up, how could they possibly be tied up with two German doctors?

This unsolvable problem began to make Tom sleepy. And Reeves. What was happening to Reeves in Ascona? Madcap Reeves. Tom still had a lurking affection for him. Reeves was now and then maladroit, but his crazy heart was in the right place.

SIMONE SAT BESIDE the flat bed, more wheels than bed, on which Jonathan lay taking in blood through a tube in his arm, Jonathan as usual avoided looking at the jar of blood. Simone was grim. She had spoken with the nurse out of Jonathan‚Äôs hearing. Jonathan thought his condition now wasn‚Äôt serious (assuming Simone had heard anything), or Simone would have been more concerned about him, kinder. Jonathan was propped on a pillow, and there was a white blanket pulled up to his waist for warmth.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre wearing that man‚Äôs pajamas,‚Äù Simone said.

‚ÄúDarling, I had to wear something‚Äîto sleep in. It must‚Äôve been six in the morning when we got back‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan broke off, feeling hopeless and tired. Simone had told him that Tom had called at the house to tell her where he was. Simone‚Äôs reaction had been anger. Jonathan had never seen her so grim. She detested Tom as if he were Landru or Svengali. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Georges?‚Äù Jonathan asked.

‚ÄúI telephoned G√©rard. He and Yvonne are coming to the house at ten-thirty. Georges will let them in.‚Äù

They would wait for Simone, Jonathan thought, then they would all go to Nemours for Sunday lunch. ‚ÄúThey want me to stay here till at least three, I know,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúThe tests, you know.‚Äù He knew she knew, probably another marrow sample would be taken, which required only ten or fifteen minutes, but there were always other tests, urine, the spleen-feeling. Jonathan still did not feel well, and he didn‚Äôt know what to expect. Simone‚Äôs hardness further upset him.

‚ÄúI cannot understand. I cannot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJon, why do you see this monster?‚Äù

Tom was not really such a monster. But how to explain? Jonathan tried again. ‚ÄúDo you realize that last night‚Äîthose men were killers? They had guns, they had garrotes. Tu comprends, garrotes.‚Äî They came to Tom‚Äôs house.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd why were you there?‚Äù

Gone was the excuse of paintings that Tom wanted framed. One didn‚Äôt help Tom kill people, help him get rid of corpses, because one was going to frame a few pictures. And what was the favor Tom Ripley had done him to make him cooperate so? Jonathan closed his eyes, gathering strength, trying to think.

‚ÄúMadame‚Äî‚Äù That was the nurse‚Äôs voice.

Jonathan heard the nurse telling Simone that she should not tire her husband. ‚ÄúI promise you that I will explain, Simone.‚Äù

Simone had stood up. ‚ÄúI think you cannot explain. I think you are afraid to. This man has trapped you‚Äîand why? For money. He pays you. But why?‚Äî You want me to think that you are a criminal too? Like that monster?‚Äù

The nurse had gone away and couldn‚Äôt hear. Jonathan looked at Simone through half-closed eyes, desperate, wordless, defeated, for the moment. Couldn‚Äôt he make her see, sometime, that it was not so black and white as she thought? But Jonathan felt a chill of fear, a premonition of failure, like death.

And Simone was leaving, as if on a final word‚Äîher word, her attitude. At the doorway she blew him a kiss, but perfunctorily, like a person in church genuflecting barely, without thinking, as he passed some object. She was gone. The day ahead stretched like a bad dream to come. The hospital might decide to keep him overnight. Jonathan closed his eyes and moved his head from side to side.

They were almost finished the tests by 1 p.m.

‚ÄúYou have been under a strain, haven‚Äôt you, m‚Äôsieur?‚Äù asked a young doctor. ‚ÄúAny unusual exertions?‚Äù Unexpectedly, he laughed. ‚ÄúMoving house? Or too much gardening?‚Äù

Jonathan smiled politely. He was feeling a little better. Suddenly Jonathan laughed too, but not at what the doctor had said. Suppose it had been the beginning of the end, this morning‚Äôs collapse? Jonathan was pleased with himself because he had pulled through it without losing his nerve. Maybe he could do that one day with the real thing. They let him walk down a corridor for the final test, the spleen palpation.

‚ÄúM. Trevanny? There is a telephone call for you,‚Äù a nurse said. ‚ÄúSince you are so near‚Äî‚Äù She motioned toward a desk and a telephone, which was off the hook.

Jonathan felt sure it was Tom. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúJonathan, hello. Tom. How is everything? . . . Can‚Äôt be too bad if you‚Äôre on your feet now . . . That‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Tom sounded really pleased.

‚ÄúSimone was here. Thank you,‚Äù Jonathan said. ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù Even though they were talking in English, Jonathan couldn‚Äôt get the words out.

‚ÄúYou had a tough time, I can understand.‚Äù Platitudes. Tom at his end heard the anxiety in Jonathan‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúI did my best this morning, but do you want me to‚Äîto try to talk with her again?‚Äù

Jonathan moistened his lips. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs not of course that she‚Äî‚Äù He‚Äôd been going to say ‚Äúthreatened anything,‚Äù such as taking Georges and leaving him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you can do anything. She‚Äôs so‚Äî‚Äù

Tom understood. ‚ÄúSuppose I try? I will. Courage, Jonathan! you‚Äôre going home today?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. I think so. By the way, Simone is with her family in Nemours for lunch today.‚Äù

Tom said he wouldn‚Äôt try to see her till about 5 p.m. If Jonathan was home then, that would be fine.

IT WAS A BIT AWKWARD for Tom, Simone‚Äôs not having a telephone. On the other hand, if there‚Äôd been a telephone, she would probably have given him a firm ‚ÄúNo‚Äù if he asked if he might come to see her. Tom bought flowers, yellow forced dahlias, from a vendor near the ch√¢teau in Fontainebleau, as he had nothing presentable as yet from his own garden. Tom rang the Trevanny doorbell at 5:20 p.m.

There were steps, then Simone‚Äôs voice, ‚ÄúQui est-ce?‚Äù

‚ÄúTom Ripley.‚Äù

A delay.

Then Simone opened the door with a stony face.

‚ÄúGood afternoon‚Äîbonjour, encore,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúCould I speak with you for a few minutes, madame? Has Jonathan returned?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe will be home at seven. He is having another transfusion, Simone replied.

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Tom boldly took a step into the house, not knowing if Simone would flare up or not. ‚ÄúI brought these for your house, madame.‚Äù He presented the flowers with a smile. ‚ÄúAnd Georges. Bonjour, Georges.‚Äù Tom extended his hand, and the child took it, smiling up at him. Tom had thought of bringing sweets for Georges, but he hadn‚Äôt wanted to overdo it.

‚ÄúWhat is it you want?‚Äù Simone asked. She had given Tom a cool ‚ÄúMerci‚Äù in regard to the flowers.

‚ÄúI definitely must explain. I must explain last night. That is why I am here, madame.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean‚Äîyou can explain?‚Äù

Tom returned her cynical smile with a fresh and open one. ‚ÄúAs much as anyone can explain the Mafia. Of course! Yes! Come to think of it, I could have bought them off‚ÄîI suppose. What else do they want except money? However, in this case I‚Äôm not so sure, because they had a special grudge against me.‚Äù

Simone was interested. But this fact did not diminish her antipathy to Tom. She had taken a step back from him.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we go into your living room‚Äîperhaps?‚Äù

Simone led the way. Georges followed them, gazing fixedly at Tom. Simone motioned Tom to the sofa. Tom sat down on the Chesterfield, gently slapped its black leather and started to pay Simone a compliment on it and didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYes, a special grudge,‚Äù Tom resumed. ‚ÄúI‚Äî You see, I happened‚Äîjust happened to be on the same train as your husband when he was returning from a visit to Munich recently. You remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúMuniche!‚Äù said Georges, his face lighting up as if in anticipation of a story.

Tom smiled back at him. ‚ÄúMuniche.‚Äî Alors, on this train‚Äîfor reasons of my own‚ÄîI will not hesitate to tell you, madame, that sometimes I take the law into my own hands just as much as the Mafia do. The difference is, I don‚Äôt blackmail honest people, I don‚Äôt expect protection money from people who wouldn‚Äôt need protection if not for my threats.‚Äù It was so abstract, Tom was sure Georges was not following it, despite Georges‚Äô intense gaze at Tom.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you getting at?‚Äù Simone asked.

‚ÄúAt the fact that I killed one of those beasts on the train, and nearly killed the other‚Äîpushed him out‚Äîand Jonathan was there and saw me. You see‚Äî‚Äù Tom was only briefly daunted by the shock in Simone‚Äôs face, by her fearful glance at Georges who was following the story avidly, and perhaps thought that ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù were indeed animals, or maybe that Tom was making it up as he went along. ‚ÄúYou see, I had time to explain the situation to Jonathan. We were on the platform‚Äîon the moving train. Jonathan kept a lookout for me, that‚Äôs all he did. But I‚Äôm grateful. He helped. And I hope you see, Madame Trevanny, that it was for a good cause. Look at the way the French police are fighting the Mafia down in Marseille, the drug merchants. Look at the way everyone is fighting the Mafia! Trying to. But one must expect dangerous retaliations from them, you know that. So that‚Äôs what happened last night. I‚Äî‚Äù Did he dare say he had asked for Jonathan‚Äôs help? Yes. ‚ÄúIt was entirely my fault that Jonathan was at my house, because I asked him if he would be willing to help me again.‚Äù

Simone looked puzzled, and highly suspicious. ‚ÄúFor money, of course.‚Äù

Tom had expected this, and remained calm. ‚ÄúNo. No, madame.‚Äù It was a matter of honor, Tom started to say, but that didn‚Äôt completely make sense, even to him. Friendship, but Simone wouldn‚Äôt like that. ‚ÄúIt was kindness on Jonathan‚Äôs part. Kindness and courage. You shouldn‚Äôt reproach him.‚Äù

Simone shook her head slowly, disbelieving. ‚ÄúMy husband is not a police agent, m‚Äôsieur. Why don‚Äôt you tell me the truth?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I am,‚Äù Tom said simply, opening his hands.

Simone sat tensely in the armchair, her fingers working together now. ‚ÄúVery recently,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúmy husband has received quite a bit of money. Are you saying that that has nothing to do with you?‚Äù

Tom leaned back on the sofa and crossed his feet at the ankles. He was wearing his oldest, nearly worn-out desert boots. ‚ÄúAh, yes. He told me a little about that,‚Äù Tom said with a smile. ‚ÄúThe German doctors are making a bet together, and they‚Äôve entrusted the take to Jonathan. Isn‚Äôt that right? I thought he‚Äôd told you.‚Äù

Simone merely listened, waiting for more.

‚ÄúIn addition, Jonathan told me they‚Äôd given him a bonus‚Äîor prize money. After all they are using him to experiment on.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe also told me there was no‚Äîno real danger in the drugs, so why should he be paid?‚Äù She shook her head and laughed briefly. ‚ÄúNo, m‚Äôsieur.‚Äù

Tom was silent. His face showed disappointment, and he meant it to. ‚ÄúThere are stranger things, madame. I‚Äôm simply telling you what Jonathan told me. I have no reason to think it isn‚Äôt true.‚Äù

That was the end of it. Simone stirred restlessly in her chair, then stood up. She had a lovely face, clear, handsome eyes and brows, an intelligent mouth that could be soft or stern. Just now it was stern. She gave him a polite smile. ‚ÄúAnd what do you know about the death of M. Gauthier? Anything? I understand you often bought things at his shop.‚Äù

Tom had stood up, and he faced this, at least, with a clear conscience. ‚ÄúI know that he was run over, madame, by a hit-and-run driver.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is all you know?‚Äù Simone‚Äôs voice was a little higher pitched, and it trembled.

‚ÄúI know that it was an accident.‚Äù Tom wished that he hadn‚Äôt to speak in French. He felt he was being blunt. ‚ÄúThat accident makes no sense. If you think I‚Äîthat I had anything to do with it, madame‚Äîthen perhaps you will tell me for what purpose. Really, madame‚Äî‚Äù Tom glanced at Georges, who was now reaching for a toy on the floor. Gauthier‚Äôs death was like something in a Greek tragedy. But no, Greek tragedies had reasons for everything.

Her mouth twitched a little, bitterly. ‚ÄúI trust you won‚Äôt have need of Jonathan again?‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt call on him if I do,‚Äù Tom said pleasantly. ‚ÄúHow is‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI would think,‚Äù she interrupted, ‚Äúthe people to call on are the police. Don‚Äôt you agree? Or perhaps you are already in the secret police? Of America, perhaps?‚Äù

Her sarcasm had very deep roots, Tom realized. He was never going to succeed with Simone. Tom smiled a little, though he felt slightly wounded. He‚Äôd endured worse words in his life, but in this case it was a pity because he had so wanted to convince Simone. ‚ÄúNo, that I am not. I get into scrapes now and then, as I think you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúScrapes, what is scrapes?‚Äù Georges piped up, his blond head turning from Tom to his mother. He was on his feet, very near them.

Tom had used the word p√©trins‚Äîwhich he‚Äôd had to grope for.

‚ÄúSh-h, Georges,‚Äù said his mother.

‚ÄúBut in this case, you must admit to take on the Mafia is not a bad thing.‚Äù Whose side are you on, Tom wanted to ask, but that would be rubbing it in.

‚ÄúM. Ripley, you are an extremely sinister personage. That is all I know. I would be most grateful if you left both me and my husband alone.‚Äù

Tom‚Äôs flowers lay on the hall table, waterless.

‚ÄúHow is Jonathan now?‚Äù Tom asked in the hall. ‚ÄúI hope he‚Äôs better.‚Äù Tom was even afraid to say he hoped Jonathan would be home tonight, lest Simone think he intended to use him again.

‚ÄúI think he is all right‚Äîbetter. Good-bye, Mr. Ripley.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood-bye and thank you,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúAu revoir, Georges.‚Äù Tom patted the boy‚Äôs head, and Georges smiled.

Tom went out to his car. Gauthier! A familiar face, a neighborhood face, now gone. It piqued Tom that Simone thought he had had something to do with it, had arranged it, even though Jonathan had told him days ago that Simone thought this. My God, the taint! Well, yes, he had the taint, all right. Worse, he had killed people. True. Dickie Greenleaf. That was the taint, the real crime. Hotheadedness of youth. Nonsense! It had been greed, jealousy, resentment of Dickie. And of course Dickie‚Äôs death‚Äîrather his murder‚Äîhad caused Tom to kill the American slob called Freddie Miles. Long past, all that. But he had done it, yes. The law half-suspected it. But they couldn‚Äôt prove it. The story had crept through the public, the public mind, like ink creeping through a blotter. Tom was ashamed. A youthful, dreadful mistake. A fatal mistake, one might think, it was just that he had amazing luck afterward. He‚Äôd survived it, physically speaking. And surely his‚Äîmurder since then, Murchison for instance, had most certainly been done to protect others as much as himself.

Simone was shocked‚Äîwhat woman wouldn‚Äôt have been‚Äîat seeing two corpses on the floor when she walked into Belle Ombre last night. But hadn‚Äôt he been protecting her husband as well as himself? If the Mafia had caught him and tortured him, wouldn‚Äôt he have come out with the name and address of Jonathan Trevanny?

This made Tom think of Reeves Minot. How was he faring? Tom thought he ought to ring him. Tom found himself staring with a frown at the handle of his car door. His door was not even locked, and his keys, in Tom‚Äôs usual style, were hanging in the dashboard.





22


The evidence of the marrow test, which a doctor took in mid-afternoon Sunday, was not good, and they wanted to keep Jonathan overnight and give him the treatment called Vincainestine, which was a complete change of blood, and which Jonathan had had before.

Simone came to see him just after 7 p.m. They had told Jonathan that she had telephoned earlier. But whoever had spoken to her had not told her that he had to stay overnight, and Simone was surprised.

‚ÄúSo‚Äîtomorrow,‚Äù she said, and seemed not to find any more words.

Jonathan lay with his head a little raised by pillows. Tom‚Äôs pajamas had been changed for a loose garment, and he had a tube in both arms. Jonathan felt a terrible distance between Simone and himself. Or was he imagining it? ‚ÄúTomorrow morning, I suppose. Don‚Äôt trouble to come here, my dear, I‚Äôll get a taxi.‚Äî How was the afternoon? How‚Äôs your family?‚Äù

Simone ignored the question. ‚ÄúYour friend M. Ripley paid a visit to me this afternoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is so‚Äîabsolutely full of lies, it is hard to know even what smallest part to believe. Maybe none of it.‚Äù Simone glanced behind her, but there was no one. Jonathan‚Äôs was one of many beds in the ward, not all of them occupied, but the ones on either side of Jonathan were occupied, and one man had a visitor.

They couldn‚Äôt easily talk.

‚ÄúGeorges will be disappointed that you don‚Äôt come back tonight,‚Äù Simone said.

Then she left.

Jonathan went home the next morning, Monday, around 10 a.m. Simone was at home, ironing some of Georges‚Äô clothing.

‚ÄúAre you feeling all right? . . . Did they give you breakfast? . . . Would you like some coffee? Or tea?‚Äù

Jonathan felt much better‚Äîone always did just after a Vincainestine, until his disease got to work and ruined the blood again, he thought. He wanted only a bath. He had a bath, then put on different clothes, old beige corduroy trousers, two sweaters because the morning was cool, or perhaps he was feeling the chill more than usually. Simone was ironing in a short-sleeved woolen dress. The morning newspaper, the Figaro, lay folded on the kitchen table with its front page outermost, as usual, but it was obvious from the looseness of the paper that Simone had looked at it.

Jonathan picked up the paper, and since Simone did not look up from her ironing, he walked into the living room. He found a two-column item in a bottom corner of the second page.

TWO CORPSES INCINERATED IN CAR

The dateline was 14 May, Chaumont. A farmer named Ren√© Gault, fifty-five, had found the still-smoking Citro√´n early on Sunday morning, and had at once alerted the police. The still unburnt papers in the wallets of the dead men identified them as Angelo Lippari, thirty-three, contractor, and Filippo Turoli, thirty-one, salesman, both of Milan. Lippari had died of skull fractures, Turoli of unknown causes, though he was believed to have been unconscious or dead when the car was set alight. There were no clues at the moment, and police were making investigations.

The garrote had been completely burnt, Jonathan supposed, and evidently Lippo so badly burnt that the signs of garroting had been destroyed.

Simone came into the doorway with folded clothing in her hands. ‚ÄúSo? I saw it too. The two Italians.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you helped M. Ripley to do that. That is what you called ‚Äòcleaning up.‚Äô‚Äù

Jonathan said nothing. He gave a sigh, sat down on the luxuriously squeaking Chesterfield sofa, but he sat up rather straight, lest Simone think he was retreating on grounds of weakness. ‚ÄúSomething had to be done with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you simply had to help,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJon‚Äînow that Georges is not here‚ÄîI think we should talk about this.‚Äù She put the clothes on top of the waist-high bookcase by the door, and sat down on the edge of the armchair. ‚ÄúYou are not telling me the truth, and neither is M. Ripley. I am wondering what else you are going to be obliged to do for him.‚Äù On the last words, her voice rose with hysteria.

‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù Jonathan did feel sure of that. And if Tom asked him to do anything else, he could quite simply refuse. At that moment, it seemed quite simple to Jonathan. He had to hold on to Simone at any cost. She was worth more than Tom Ripley, more than anything Tom could offer him.

‚ÄúIt is beyond my understanding. You knew what you were doing‚Äîlast night. You helped to kill those men, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Her voice dropped, and it trembled.

‚ÄúIt was a matter of protecting‚Äîwhat had gone before.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, yes, M. Ripley explained. By accident you were on the train as he was, coming from Munich, is that right? And you‚Äîassisted him in‚Äîin killing two people?‚Äù

‚ÄúMafia,‚Äù Jonathan said. What had Tom told her?

You‚Äîan ordinary passenger, assist a murderer? You expect me to believe that, Jon?‚Äù

Jonathan was silent, trying to think, miserable. The answer was no. You don‚Äôt seem to realize they were Mafia, Jonathan wanted to repeat. They were attacking Tom Ripley. Another lie, at least in regard to the train. Jonathan pressed his lips together, and sat back on the generous sofa. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect you to believe it. I have only two things to say, this is the end of it, and the men we killed were criminals and murderers themselves. You must admit that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you a secret police agent in your spare time?‚Äî Why are you being paid for this, Jon? You‚Äîa killer!‚Äù She stood up with her hands clenched. ‚ÄúYou are a stranger to me. I have never known you before now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Simone,‚Äù Jonathan said, standing up too.

‚ÄúI cannot like you and I cannot love you.‚Äù

Jonathan blinked. She had said that in English.

She continued in French: ‚ÄúYou are leaving out something, I know. And I don‚Äôt even want to know what it is. Do you understand? It is some horrible connection with M. Ripley, that odious personage‚Äîand I wonder what,‚Äù she added with the bitter sarcasm again. ‚ÄúPlainly it is something too disgusting for you to tell me, I shouldn‚Äôt wonder. You‚Äôve no doubt covered up some other crime for him, and for this you‚Äôre being paid, for this you‚Äôre in his power. Very well, I don‚Äôt want‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not in his power! You‚Äôll see!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen enough!‚Äù She went out, taking the clothes with her, and climbed the stairs.

When it came time for lunch, Simone said she wasn‚Äôt hungry. Jonathan made himself a boiled egg. Then he went to his shop, and kept the FERME sign in the door, because he was not officially open on Mondays. Nothing had changed since Saturday noon. He could see that Simone hadn‚Äôt been in. Jonathan suddenly thought of the Italian gun, usually in a drawer, now at Tom Ripley‚Äôs. Jonathan cut one frame, cut the glass for it, but lost heart when it came to driving the nails in. What was he to do about Simone? What if he told her the whole story, just as it had been? Jonathan knew, however, that he was up against a Catholic attitude about taking human life. Not to mention that Simone would consider the original proposition to him ‚ÄúFantastic!‚Äî Disgusting!‚Äù Curious that the Mafia was a hundred percent Catholic, and they didn‚Äôt mind about human life. But he, Simone‚Äôs husband, was different. He shouldn‚Äôt take human life. And if he told her it was a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù on his part, that he regretted it‚Äî Hopeless. First of all, he didn‚Äôt particularly believe it had been a mistake, so why tell another lie?

Jonathan went with more determination back to his work-table, and got the glue and nails in the picture frame, and sealed it neatly with brown paper on the back. He clipped the owner‚Äôs name to the picture wire. Then he looked over his orders to be filled, and tackled one more picture, which like the other needed no mat. He went on working until 6 p.m. Then he bought bread and wine, and some ham slices from a charcuterie, enough for dinner for the three of them in case Simone hadn‚Äôt done any shopping.

Simone said, ‚ÄúI am in terror that the police will knock on the door at any moment, wanting to see you.‚Äù

Jonathan, setting the table, said nothing for a few seconds. ‚ÄúThey will not. Why should they?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no such thing as no clues. They will find M. Ripley, and he will tell them about you.‚Äù

Jonathan was sure she hadn‚Äôt eaten all day. He found some leftover potatoes‚Äîmashed potatoes‚Äîin the fridge, and went about preparing the dinner himself. Georges came down from his room.

‚ÄúWhat did they do to you in the hospital, Papa?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have completely new blood,‚Äù Jonathan replied with a smile, flexing his arms. ‚ÄúThink of that. All new blood‚Äîoh, at least eight liters of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much is that?‚Äù Georges spread his arms also.

‚ÄúEight times this bottle,‚Äù said Jonathan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what took all night.‚Äù

Though Jonathan made an effort, he couldn‚Äôt lift the gloom, the silence of Simone. She poked at her food and said nothing. Georges couldn‚Äôt understand. Jonathan‚Äôs efforts, failing, embarrassed him, and over coffee he too was silent, not able even to chat with Georges.

Jonathan wondered if she had spoken with her brother G√©rard. He steered Georges into the living room to watch the television, the new set which had arrived a few days ago. The programs‚Äîthere were only two channels‚Äîweren‚Äôt interesting for kids at this hour, but Jonathan hoped he would stay with one of them for a while.

‚ÄúDid you talk to G√©rard by any chance?‚Äù Jonathan asked, not able to repress the question.

‚ÄúOf course not. Do you think I could possibly tell him‚Äîthis?‚Äù She was smoking a cigarette, a rare thing for her. She glanced at the doorway to the hall, to be sure Georges was not coming back. ‚ÄúJon‚ÄîI think we should make some arrangement to separate.‚Äù

On the television, a French politician was speaking about syndicates, trade unions.

Jonathan sat down again in his chair. ‚ÄúDarling, I do know.‚Äî It‚Äôs a shock to you. Will you let a few days pass? I know, somehow, I can make you understand. Really.‚Äù Jonathan spoke with utmost conviction, and yet he realized he was not convinced himself, not at all. It was like an instinctive clinging to life, Jonathan thought, his clinging to Simone.

‚ÄúYes, of course you think that. But I know myself. I am not an emotional young girl, you know.‚Äù Her eyes looked straight at him, hardly angry now, only determined, and distant.‚Äù I am not interested in all your money now, not any of it. I can make my own way‚Äîwith Georges.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Georges‚Äîmy God, Simone, I‚Äôll support Georges!‚Äù Jonathan could hardly believe they were saying these words. He got up, drew Simone up from her chair a little roughly, and some coffee spilled out of her cup into the saucer. Jonathan embraced her, would have kissed her, but she squirmed away.

‚ÄúNon!‚Äù She put her cigarette out, and started clearing the table. ‚ÄúI am sorry to say also that I don‚Äôt want to sleep in the same bed with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes, I assumed that.‚Äù And you‚Äôll go to church tomorrow and say a prayer for my soul, Jonathan thought. ‚ÄúSimone, you must let a little time go by. Don‚Äôt say things now that you don‚Äôt mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will not change. Ask M. Ripley. I think he knows.‚Äù

Georges came back. Television was forgotten, and he looked at them both with puzzlement.

Jonathan touched George‚Äôs head with his fingertips as he went into the hall. Jonathan had thought to go up to the bedroom‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt their bedroom anymore, and anyway what would he do up there? The television droned on. Jonathan turned in a circle in the hall, then took his raincoat and a muffler, and went out. He walked to the Rue de France and turned left and at the end of the street went into the bar-caf√© on the corner. He wanted to telephone Tom Ripley. He remembered Tom‚Äôs number.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúJonathan.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you? . . . I telephoned the hospital, I heard you stayed the night. You‚Äôre out now?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes, this morning. I‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan gasped.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúCould I see you for a few minutes? If you think it‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôm‚ÄîI suppose I could get a taxi. Surely.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe corner bar‚Äîthe new one near the Aigle Noir.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could pick you up. No?‚Äù Tom suspected Jonathan had had a bad scene with Simone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll walk toward the Monument. I want to walk a little. I‚Äôll see you there.‚Äù

Jonathan felt at once better. It was spurious, no doubt, it was postponing the situation with Simone, but for the moment that didn‚Äôt matter. He felt like a tortured man momentarily relieved of the torture, and he was grateful for a few moments of the relief. Jonathan lit a cigarette and walked slowly, because it would take Tom nearly fifteen minutes. Jonathan went into the Bar des Sports, just beyond the H√¥tel de l‚ÄôAigle Noir, and ordered a beer. He tried not to think at all. Then one thought rose to the surface on its own: Simone would come around. As soon as he thought consciously about this, he feared that she wouldn‚Äôt. He was alone now. Jonathan knew he was alone, that even Georges was more than half cut off from him now, because surely Simone was going to keep Georges, but Jonathan was aware that he didn‚Äôt yet realize it fully. That would take days. Feelings were slower than thoughts. Sometimes.

Tom‚Äôs dark Renault in a thin stream of other cars came out of the darkness of the woods into the light around the Obelisque, the Monument. It was a little past 8 p.m. Jonathan was on the corner, on the left side of the road, and Tom‚Äôs right. Tom would have to make the complete circle to regain his road homeward‚Äîif they went to Tom‚Äôs. Jonathan preferred Tom‚Äôs house to a bar. Tom stopped and unlatched the door.

‚ÄúEvening!‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúEvening,‚Äù Jonathan replied, pulling the door shut, and at once Tom moved off. ‚ÄúCan we go to your place? I don‚Äôt feel like a crowded bar.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a bad evening. And day, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I thought. Simone?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seems she‚Äôs finished. Who can blame her?‚Äù Jonathan felt awkward, started to take a cigarette, and found even that purposeless, so he didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI tried my best,‚Äù Tom said. He was concentrating on driving as fast as possible without bringing down a motorcycle cop, some of whom lurked in the woods at the edge of the road here.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs the money‚Äîit‚Äôs the corpses, good Christ! As for the money, I said I was holding the stake for the Germans, you know.‚Äù It was suddenly ludicrous to Jonathan, the money, the bet also. The money was so concrete in a way, so tangible, so useful, and yet not nearly so tangible or meaningful as the two dead men that Simone had seen. Tom was driving quite fast. Jonathan felt unconcerned whether they hit a tree or bounced off the road. ‚ÄúTo put it simply,‚Äù Jonathan went on, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the dead men. The fact that I helped‚Äîor did it. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to change.‚Äù What profiteth it a man‚Äî Jonathan could have laughed. He hadn‚Äôt gained the whole world, nor had he lost his soul. Anyway, Jonathan didn‚Äôt believe in a soul. Self-respect was more like it. He hadn‚Äôt lost his self-respect, only Simone. Simone was morale, however, and wasn‚Äôt morale self-respect?

Tom did not think Simone was going to change toward Jonathan either, but he said nothing. Maybe he could talk at home, and yet what else could he say? Words of comfort, words of hope, of reconciliation, when he didn‚Äôt really believe there‚Äôd be one? And yet who knew about women? Sometimes they appeared to have stronger moral attitudes than men, and at other times‚Äîespecially as to political skullduggery and the political swine they could sometimes marry‚Äîit seemed to Tom that women were more flexible, more capable of double-think than men. Unfortunately, Simone presented a picture of inflexible rectitude. Hadn‚Äôt Jonathan said she was a churchgoer too? But Tom‚Äôs thoughts were equally on Reeves Minot now. Reeves was nervous, for no very strong reason that Tom could see. Suddenly Tom was at the turnoff at Villeperce, guiding the car slowly through the familiar, quiet streets.

And there was Belle Ombre behind the tall poplars, a light glowing above the doorway‚Äîall intact.

Tom had just made coffee, and Jonathan said he would join him in a cup. Tom heated the coffee a bit, and brought it with the brandy bottle to the coffee table.

‚ÄúSpeaking of problems,‚Äù Tom said, ‚ÄúReeves wants to come to France. I phoned him today from Sens. He‚Äôs in Ascona staying at a hotel called the Three Bears.‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúHe imagines he‚Äôs being spied on‚Äîby people in the street. I tried to tell him‚Äîour enemies don‚Äôt waste time with that sort of thing. He should know. I tried to discourage him from coming even to Paris. Certainly not to my place, here. I wouldn‚Äôt call Belle Ombre the safest spot in the world, would you? Naturally, I couldn‚Äôt even hint at Saturday night, which might‚Äôve reassured Reeves. I mean, we at least got rid of the two people who saw us on the train. I‚Äôm not sure how long the peace and quiet will last.‚Äù Tom hitched forward, elbows on his knees, and glanced at the silent windows. ‚ÄúReeves doesn‚Äôt know anything about Saturday night, or didn‚Äôt say anything, anyway. Might not even connect it, if he reads the papers. I suppose you saw the papers today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Jonathan said.

‚ÄúNo clues. Nothing on the radio tonight either, but the TV boys gave it a spot. No clues.‚Äù Tom smiled, and reached for one of his small cigars. He extended the box to Jonathan, but Jonathan shook his head. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs equally good news, not a question from the townsfolk here. I bought bread and went to the butcher‚Äôs today‚Äîon foot, taking my time‚Äîjust to see. And around seven-thirty p.m. Howard Clegg arrived, one of my neighbors. Bringing me a big plastic sack of horse manure from one of his farmer friends where he buys a rabbit now and then.‚Äù Tom puffed on his cigar and relaxed with a laugh. ‚ÄúIt was Howard who stopped his car outside Saturday night, remember? He thought we had guests, Heloise and I, and that it mightn‚Äôt be the time to deliver horse manure.‚Äù Tom rambled on, trying to fill in the time, while Jonathan, he hoped, lost a little of his tension. ‚ÄúI told him Heloise was away for a few days, and I said I‚Äôd been entertaining some friends from Paris, hence the Paris car outside. I think that went down very well.‚Äù

The clock on the mantel struck nine, with pure little pings.

‚ÄúHowever, back to Reeves,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI thought of writing him, saying I had some grounds for thinking the situation had improved, but two things stopped me. Reeves might leave Ascona at any hour now, and second, things haven‚Äôt improved for him, if the wogs still want to get him. He‚Äôs using the name Ralph Platt now, but they know his real name and what he looks like. There‚Äôs nothing for Reeves but Brazil, if the Mafia still wants to get him. And even Brazil‚Äî‚Äù Tom smiled, but not happily now.

‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt he rather used to it?‚Äù Jonathan asked.

‚ÄúLike this? No.‚Äî Very few people, I suppose, get used to the Mafia and live to talk about it. They may live, but not very comfortably.‚Äù

But Reeves had brought it on himself, Jonathan was thinking. And Reeves had drawn him into it. No, he‚Äôd walked into it of his own free will, let himself be persuaded‚Äîfor money. And it was Tom Ripley who had‚Äîat least tried to help him collect that money, even if it had been Tom‚Äôs idea from the start, this deadly game. Jonathan‚Äôs mind spun back to those minutes on the train between Munich and Strassburg.

‚ÄúI am sorry about Simone,‚Äù Tom said. Jonathan‚Äôs long, cramped figure, hunched over his coffee cup, seemed to illustrate failure, like a statue. ‚ÄúWhat does she want to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan shrugged. ‚ÄúShe talks about a separation. Taking Georges, of course. She has a brother, G√©rard, in Nemours. I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôll say to him‚Äîor to her family there. She‚Äôs absolutely shocked, you see. And ashamed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do understand.‚Äù So is Heloise ashamed, Tom thought, but Heloise was more capable of double-think. Heloise knew he dabbed in murder, crime‚Äîyet was it crime? At least recently, with the Derwatt thing, and now the accursed Mafia? Tom brushed the moral question aside for the moment, and at the same time found himself flicking a bit of ash off his knee. What was Jonathan going to do with himself? Without Simone, he‚Äôd have no morale at all. Tom wondered if he should try talking to Simone again? But his memory of yesterday‚Äôs interview discouraged him. Tom didn‚Äôt fancy trying again with Simone.

‚ÄúI am finished,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Tom started to speak, and Jonathan interrupted:

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm finished with Simone‚Äîor she is with me. Then there‚Äôs the old business of how long will I live anyway? Why drag it on? So Tom‚Äî‚Äù Jonathan stood up. ‚ÄúIf I can be of service, even suicidal, I‚Äôm at your disposal.‚Äù

Tom smiled. ‚ÄúBrandy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, a little. Thanks.‚Äù

Tom poured it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent the last few minutes trying to explain why I think‚ÄîI think we‚Äôre over the hump. That is with the wogs. Of course we‚Äôre not out of the woods if they catch Reeves‚Äîand torture him. He might talk about both of us.‚Äù

Jonathan had thought of that. It simply didn‚Äôt matter much to him, but of course it mattered to Tom. Tom wanted to stay alive. ‚ÄúCan I be of any service? As a decoy, perhaps? A sacrifice?‚Äù Jonathan laughed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any decoys,‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say once the Mafia might want a certain amount of blood, as revenge?‚Äù

Tom had certainly thought it, but he wasn‚Äôt sure if he had said it. ‚ÄúIf we do nothing‚Äîthey may get Reeves and finish him,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúThis is called letting nature take its course. I didn‚Äôt put this idea‚Äîassassinating Mafiosi‚Äîinto Reeves‚Äôs head, and neither did you.‚Äù

Tom‚Äôs cool attitude took the wind out of Jonathan‚Äôs sails a little. He sat down. ‚ÄúAnd what about Fritz? Any news? I remember Fritz well.‚Äù Jonathan smiled, as if recollecting halcyon days, Fritz arriving at Reeves‚Äôs flat in Hamburg, cap in hand, with a friendly smile and the efficient little pistol.

Tom had to think for a moment who Fritz was: the factotum, the taxi-driver-messenger in Hamburg. ‚ÄúNo. Let‚Äôs hope Fritz has returned to his folks in the country, as Reeves said. I hope he‚Äôs staying there. Maybe they‚Äôre finished with Fritz.‚Äù Tom stood up. ‚ÄúJonathan, you‚Äôve got to go home tonight and face the music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Tom had, however, made him feel better. Tom was realistic, even about Simone. ‚ÄúFunny, the problem isn‚Äôt the Mafia anymore, it‚Äôs Simone‚Äîfor me.‚Äù

Tom knew. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you, if you like. Try to talk with her again.‚Äù

Jonathan shrugged again. He was on his feet now, restless. He glanced at the painting that Tom had said was called ‚ÄúMan in Chair,‚Äù by Derwatt, over the fireplace. He was reminded of Reeves‚Äôs flat, with another Derwatt over the fireplace, maybe destroyed now. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll be sleeping on the Chesterfield tonight‚Äîwhatever happens,‚Äù Jonathan said.

Tom thought of turning on the news. It wasn‚Äôt the right time to get anything, though, not even to get Italy. ‚ÄúWhat do you think? Simone can always forbid me the door. Unless you think it‚Äôll make it worse for you if I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThings could not be worse.‚Äî All right. I‚Äôd like you to come, yes. But what‚Äôll we say?‚Äù

Tom pushed his hands into the pockets of his old gray flannels. In his right pocket was the small Italian gun which Jonathan had carried on the train. Tom had slept with it under his pillow since Saturday night. Yes, what to say? Tom usually relied on inspiration of the moment, but hadn‚Äôt he already shot his bolt with Simone? What other brilliant facet of the problem could he come up with, to dazzle her eyes, her brain, and make her see things their way? ‚ÄúThe only thing to do,‚Äù Tom said thoughtfully, ‚Äúis try and convince her of the safety of everything‚Äînow. I admit that‚Äôs hard to do. That‚Äôs hurdling the corpses all night. But much of her trouble is anxiety, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Äîare things safe?‚Äù Jonathan asked. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt be sure, can we?‚Äî It‚Äôs Reeves, I suppose.‚Äù





23


They were in Fontainebleau at 10 p.m. Jonathan led the way up the front steps, knocked, then put his key into the lock. But the door was bolted inside.

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Simone called.

‚ÄúJon.‚Äù

She slid the bolt. ‚ÄúOh, Jon‚ÄîI was worried!‚Äù

That sounded hopeful, Tom thought.

In the next second, Simone saw Tom, and her expression changed.

‚ÄúYes‚ÄîTom‚Äôs with me. Can‚Äôt we come in?‚Äù

She looked on the brink of saying no, then she stepped back a little, stiffly. Jonathan and Tom went in.

‚ÄúGood evening, madame,‚Äù Tom said.

In the living room the television was on, some sewing‚Äîwhat looked like a repair on a coat lining‚Äîlay on the black leather sofa, and Georges was playing with a toy truck on the floor. The picture of domestic calm, Tom thought. He said hello to Georges.

‚ÄúDo sit down, Tom,‚Äù said Jonathan.

But Tom didn‚Äôt, because Simone showed no sign of sitting.

‚ÄúAnd what is the reason for this visit?‚Äù she asked Tom.

‚ÄúMadame, I‚Äî‚Äù Tom stammered on, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to take all the blame on myself, and to try to persuade you to‚Äîto be a little kinder to your husband.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are telling me that my husband‚Äî‚Äù She was suddenly aware of Georges, and with an air of nervous exasperation took him by the hand. ‚ÄúGeorges, you must go upstairs. Do you hear me? Please, darling.‚Äù

Georges went to the doorway, looked back, then entered the hall and mounted the stairs, reluctantly.

‚ÄúD√©p√™che-toi!‚Äù Simone yelled at him, then closed the living room door. ‚ÄúYou are telling me,‚Äù she resumed, ‚Äúthat my husband knows nothing about these‚Äîevents, until he just walked in on them. That this sordid money comes from a bet between doctors!‚Äù

Tom took a breath. ‚ÄúThe blame is mine. Perhaps‚ÄîJon made a mistake in helping me. But can‚Äôt that be forgiven? He is your husband‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has become a criminal. Perhaps this is your charming influence, but it is a fact. Is it not?‚Äù

Jonathan sat down in the armchair.

Tom decided to take one end of the sofa‚Äîuntil Simone ordered him out of the house. Bravely, Tom started again. ‚ÄúJon came to see me tonight to discuss this, madame. He is most upset. Marriage‚Äîis a sacred thing, you know that well. His life, his courage would be quite destroyed if he lost your affections. You surely realize that. And you should think also of your son, who needs his father.‚Äù

Simone was a little affected by Tom‚Äôs words, but she replied, ‚ÄúYes, a father. A real father to respect. I agree!‚Äù

Tom heard footsteps on the stone steps, and looked quickly to Jonathan.

‚ÄúExpecting someone?‚Äù Jonathan asked Simone. She had probably telephoned G√©rard, he thought.

She shook her head. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Tom and Jonathan jumped up.

‚ÄúBolt the door again,‚Äù Tom whispered in English to Jonathan. ‚ÄúAsk who it is.‚Äù

A neighbor, Jonathan thought as he went to the door. He slid the bolt quietly shut. ‚ÄúQui est-ce, s‚Äôil vous plait?‚Äù

‚ÄúM. Trevanny?‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt recognize the man‚Äôs voice, and looked over his shoulder at Tom in the hall.

There‚Äôd be more than one, Tom thought.

‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù asked Simone.

Tom put his finger to his lips. Then, not caring what Simone‚Äôs reaction might be, Tom went down the hall toward the kitchen, which had a light on. Simone was following him. Tom looked around for something heavy. He still had one garrote in his hip pocket, and of course it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary if the caller was a neighbor.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doing?‚Äù Simone asked.

Tom was opening a narrow yellow door in a corner of the kitchen. It was a broom closet, and here he saw what he might need, a hammer, and besides that a chisel, plus several innocuous mops and brooms. ‚ÄúI might be more useful here,‚Äù Tom said, picking up the hammer. He was expecting a shot through the door, the sound of the front door being assaulted by shoulders from outside, perhaps. Then he heard the faint click of the bolt being slid‚Äîopen. Was Jonathan mad?

Simone at once started off boldly into the hall, and Tom heard her gasp. There was a scuffling sound in the hall, then the door slammed shut.

‚ÄúMme. Trevanny?‚Äù said a man‚Äôs voice.

Simone‚Äôs cry was shut off before it became a real cry. The sounds came up the hall now toward the kitchen.

Simone appeared, sliding on the heels of her shoes, manhandled by a thick fellow in a dark suit, who had his hand over her mouth. Tom, to the left of the man as he entered the kitchen, stepped out and hit him with the hammer just below his hat-brim in the back of the neck. The man was by no means unconscious, but he released Simone, and straightened up a little, so that Tom had an opportunity to bash him on the nose, and this Tom followed‚Äîthe man‚Äôs hat having fallen off‚Äîby a blow on the forehead, straightforward and true, as if he had been an ox in a slaughter house. The man‚Äôs legs sank under him.

Simone got to her feet, and Tom drew her toward the broom closet corner, which was concealed from the hall. As far as Tom knew, there was only one other man in the house, and the silence made Tom think of the garrote. With his hammer, Tom went up the hall toward the front door. Quiet as he tried to be, he was still heard by the Italian in the living room, who had Jonathan on the floor. It was indeed the old garrote again. Tom sprang at him with the hammer raised. The Italian‚Äîin a gray suit, gray hat‚Äîreleased the garrote and was pulling his gun from a shoulder holster when Tom hit him in the cheekbone. More accurate than a tennis racket, the hammer! The man, who had not quite stood up, lurched forward, and Tom removed his hat quickly with his left hand and with his right came down again with the hammer.

Crack! Little Leviathan‚Äôs dark eyes closed, his pink lips relaxed, and he thudded to the floor.

Tom knelt beside Jonathan. The nylon cord was already well into Jonathan‚Äôs flesh. Tom turned Jonathan‚Äôs head this way and that, trying to get at the cord to loosen it. Jonathan‚Äôs teeth were bared, and he was trying with his own fingers, but feebly.

Simone was suddenly beside them, holding something that looked like a letter opener. She pried with the point of it into the side of Jonathan‚Äôs neck. The string loosened.

Tom lost his balance on his heels, sat down on the floor, and sprang up again. He yanked the curtains of the front window shut. There had been a gap of six inches between them. Tom thought that a minute and a half had passed since the Italians had come in. He picked up the hammer from the floor, went to the front door and bolted it again. There was no sound from outside, except for the normal-sounding steps of someone walking past on the pavement, and the hum of a passing car.

‚ÄúJon,‚Äù said Simone.

Jonathan coughed and rubbed his neck. He was trying to sit up.

The porcine man in gray lay motionless, with his head dropped by accident against a leg of the armchair. Tom tightened his grip on the hammer, and started to give the man one more blow, but hesitated, because there was already some blood on the carpet. But Tom thought the man was still alive.

‚ÄúPig,‚Äù Tom murmured, and pulled the man up a little by his shirt front and flamboyant tie, and smashed the hammer head into his left temple.

Georges stood wide-eyed in the doorway.

Simone had brought Jonathan a glass of water. She was kneeling beside him. ‚ÄúGo away, Georges!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPapa is all right! Go in the‚Äî Go upstairs, Georges!‚Äù

But Georges didn‚Äôt. He stood there, fascinated by a scene that was perhaps unsurpassed on the television. By the same token, he wasn‚Äôt taking it too seriously. His eyes were wide, absorbing it all, but he was not terrified.

Jonathan got to the sofa, helped by Tom and Simone. He was sitting up, and Simone had a wet towel for his face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really all right,‚Äù Jonathan mumbled.

Tom was still listening for footsteps, front or back. Of all times, Tom thought, when he‚Äôd meant to create a peaceable impression on Simone! ‚ÄúMadame, is the garden passageway locked?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Simone.

And Tom remembered ornamental spikes along the top of the iron door. He said in English to Jonathan, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs probably at least one more of them in a car outside.‚Äù Tom supposed Simone understood this, but he couldn‚Äôt tell from her face. She was looking at Jonathan, who seemed to be quite out of danger, and then she went to Georges, who was still in the doorway.

‚ÄúGeorges! Will you‚Äî!‚Äù She shooed him upstairs again, carried him halfway up the stairway, and spanked his bottom once. ‚ÄúGo into your room and close the door!‚Äù

Simone was being splendid, Tom thought. It would be a matter of seconds until another man, just as at Belle Ombre, came to the door, Tom supposed. Tom tried to imagine what the man in the car would be thinking: from the absence of noise, of screams, of gunshots, the waiting man or men probably supposed that everything had gone as planned. They must be expecting their two chums to come out the door at any moment, mission accomplished, the Trevannys garroted or beaten to death. Reeves must have talked, Tom thought, must have told them Jonathan‚Äôs name and address. Tom had a wild idea of Jonathan and himself putting on the Italians‚Äô hats, making a dash out the door to the Italians‚Äô car (if any), and taking them by surprise with‚Äîthe one small gun. But he couldn‚Äôt ask Jonathan to do that.

‚ÄúJonathan, I‚Äôd better go out before it‚Äôs too late,‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúToo late‚Äîhow?‚Äù Jonathan had wiped his face with the wet towel, and some blond hair stood on end above his forehead.

‚ÄúBefore they come to the door. They‚Äôll be suspicious if their chums don‚Äôt come out.‚Äù If the Italians saw the situation here, they‚Äôd blast the three of them with guns and make a getaway in their car, Tom was thinking. Tom went to the window and stooped looking out just above the sill level. He listened for a car motor idling somewhere, looked for a car stationed with parking lights on. Parking was permitted on the opposite side of the street today. Tom saw it‚Äîmaybe it‚Äîto the left, some twelve yards away diagonally. The big car‚Äôs parking lights were on, but Tom could not be sure the motor was, because of the hum of other noises on the street.

Jonathan was up, walking toward Tom.

‚ÄúI think I see them,‚Äù Tom said.

‚ÄúWhat should we do?‚Äù

Tom was thinking of what he would do alone, stay in the house and try to shoot anyone who broke in the door. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Simone and Georges to consider. We don‚Äôt want a fight in here. I think we should rush them‚Äîoutside. Otherwise they‚Äôll rush us here, and it‚Äôll be guns if they break in.‚Äî I can do it, Jon.‚Äù

Jonathan felt a sudden rage, a desire to guard his house and home. ‚ÄúAll right‚Äîwe‚Äôll go together!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do, Jon?‚Äù Simone asked.

‚ÄúWe think there might be more of them‚Äîcoming,‚Äù Jonathan said in French.

Tom went to the kitchen. He got the hat from the linoleum floor near the dead man, stuck it on his head and found that it fell over his ears. Then he suddenly realized that these Italians, both of them, had guns in their shoulder holsters. Tom took this man‚Äôs gun from the holster. He went back into the living room. ‚ÄúThese guns!‚Äù he said, reaching for the gun of the man on the floor. The drawn gun was hidden under his jacket. Tom took the man‚Äôs hat, found that it fitted him better, and handed Jonathan the hat from the kitchen. ‚ÄúTry this. If we can look like them till we cross the street, it‚Äôs a slight advantage. Don‚Äôt come with me, Jon. It‚Äôs just as good if one person goes out. I just want them to move off!‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll go,‚Äù Jonathan said. He knew what he had to do: scare them off, and perhaps shoot one first if he could, before he was shot himself.

Tom handed a gun to Simone, the small Italian gun. ‚ÄúIt might be useful, madame.‚Äù But she looked shy of taking the gun, and Tom laid the gun on the sofa. The safety was off.

Jonathan pushed the safety off the gun in his hand. ‚ÄúCould you see how many are in the car?‚Äù

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt see a thing inside.‚Äù On his last words, Tom heard someone walking up the front steps, cautiously, with an effort to be silent. Tom jerked his head at Jonathan. ‚ÄúBolt the door after us, madame,‚Äù he whispered to Simone.

Tom and Jonathan, both wearing hats now, walked up the hall, and Tom slid the bolt and opened the door in the face of the man standing there. At the same time, Tom bumped him and caught him by the arm, turning him back down the stairs again. Jonathan had grabbed his other arm. At a glance, in the near darkness, Tom and Jonathan might have been taken for his two chums, but Tom knew the illusion wouldn‚Äôt last more than a second or two.

‚ÄúTo the left!‚Äù Tom said to Jonathan. The man they held was struggling, but not yet yelling, and his efforts nearly lifted Tom off his feet.

Jonathan had seen the car with its parking lights on, and now he saw the lights come full on, and heard the motor revving. The car backed a little.

‚ÄúDump him!‚Äù Tom said, and he and Jonathan, like a pair that had rehearsed it, hurled the Italian forward, and his head hit the side of the slowly moving car. Tom was aware of the clatter of the Italian‚Äôs drawn gun on the street. The car had stopped, and the door in front of Tom was opening: the Mafia boys wanted their chum back, apparently. Tom pulled his gun from his trousers pocket, aimed at the driver, and fired. The driver, with the aid of a man in the back, was trying to get the dazed Italian into the front seat. Tom was afraid to fire again, because a couple of people were running toward them from the Rue de France. And a window opened in one of the houses. Tom saw, or thought he saw, the other back door of the car being opened, someone being pushed out onto the pavement.

One shot came from the back of the car, then a second, just as Jonathan stumbled or walked right in front of Tom. The car was moving off.

Tom saw Jonathan slump forward, and before Tom could catch him, Jonathan fell on the place where the car had been. Damn it, Tom thought, if he‚Äôd hit the driver, it must have been only in the arm. The car was gone.

A young man, then a man and woman came trotting up.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs shot?‚Äù

‚ÄúPolice!‚Äù The last was the cry of a young woman.

‚ÄúJon!‚Äù Tom had thought Jonathan had merely tripped, but Jonathan wasn‚Äôt getting up, and was barely stirring. With the assistance of one of the young men, Tom got Jonathan to the curb, but he was quite limp.

Jonathan had been shot in the chest, he thought, but he was mainly aware of numbness. There had been a jolt. He was going to faint soon, and maybe it was more serious than fainting. People dashed around him, shouting.

Only now did Tom recognize the figure on the sidewalk‚ÄîReeves! Reeves was crumpled, apparently trying to recover his breath.

‚Äú. . . ambulance!‚Äù a Frenchwoman‚Äôs voice was saying. ‚ÄúWe must call an ambulance!‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a car!‚Äù a man cried.

Tom glanced at Jonathan‚Äôs house windows, and saw the black silhouette of Simone‚Äôs head as she peered through the curtains. He shouldn‚Äôt leave her there, Tom thought. He had to get Jonathan to the hospital, and his car would be quicker than any ambulance. ‚ÄúReeves!‚Äî Hold the fort, I‚Äôll be back in one minute.‚Äî Oui, madame,‚Äù Tom said to a woman (now there were five or six people around them), ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take him to the hospital in my car at once!‚Äù Tom ran across the street and banged on the house door. ‚ÄúSimone, it‚Äôs Tom!‚Äù

When Simone opened the door, Tom said:

‚ÄúJonathan has been hurt. We must go to the hospital at once. Just take a coat and come. And Georges too!‚Äù

Georges was in the hall. Simone didn‚Äôt waste time with a coat, but she did grope in a coat pocket, in the hall, for her keys, then hurried back toward Tom. ‚ÄúHurt? Was he shot?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid so. My car is to the left. The green one.‚Äù His car was twenty feet behind where the Italians‚Äô car had been. Simone wanted to go to Jonathan, but Tom assured her that the most useful thing she could do was open the doors of his car, which was unlocked. There were more people, but no policeman as yet, and one officious little man asked Tom who in hell he thought he was, taking charge of everything?

‚ÄúStuff yourself!‚Äù Tom said in English. He was struggling with Reeves to lift Jonathan in the gentlest way possible. It would have been wiser to have brought the car closer, but having got Jonathan off the ground, they continued, and a couple of people assisted, so after a few steps it was not difficult. They braced Jonathan in a corner of the backseat.

Tom got into his car, dry in the mouth. ‚ÄúThis is Mme. Trevanny,‚Äù Tom said to Reeves. ‚ÄúReeves Minot.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you do?‚Äù said Reeves with his American accent.

Simone got into the back, where Jonathan was. Reeves took Georges in beside him, and Tom pulled out, heading for the Fontainebleau hospital.

‚ÄúPapa has fainted?‚Äù Georges asked.

‚ÄúOui, Georges.‚Äù Simone had begun to weep.

Jonathan heard their voices, but couldn‚Äôt speak. He couldn‚Äôt move, not even a finger. He had a gray vision of a sea running out‚Äîsomewhere on an English coast‚Äîsinking, collapsing. He was already far away from Simone whose breast he leaned against‚Äîor so he thought. But Tom was alive. Tom was driving the car, Jonathan thought, like God himself. Somewhere there had been a bullet, which somehow no longer mattered. This was death now, which he had tried to face before and yet had not faced, tried to prepare and yet hadn‚Äôt been able to. There was no preparation possible, it was merely a surrender, after all. And what he had done, misdone, accomplished, striven for‚Äîall seemed absurdity.

Tom passed an ambulance just coming up, wailing. He drove carefully. It was only four or five minutes‚Äô drive. The silence among all of them in the car became eerie to Tom. It was as if he and Reeves, Simone, Georges, Jonathan if he was conscious of anything, had been frozen in one second that went on and on.

‚ÄúThis man is dead!‚Äù said an intern in an astonished voice.

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù Tom didn‚Äôt believe it. He couldn‚Äôt get another word out.

Only Simone gave a cry.

They were standing on the concrete at one entrance to the hospital. Jonathan had been put on a stretcher, and two helpers held the stretcher poised, as if they didn‚Äôt know what to do next.

‚ÄúSimone, do you want‚Äî‚Äù But Tom didn‚Äôt even know what he had been going to say. And Simone was now running toward Jonathan who was being borne inside, and Georges followed her. Tom ran after Simone, thinking to get her keys from her, to remove the two corpses from her house, do something with them, then he stopped abruptly and his shoes slid on the concrete. The police would be at the Trevanny house before he was. The police were probably already breaking in, because the people in the street would have told them that the disturbance started from the gray house, that after the shots one person (Tom) had run back to the house, and he and a woman and small boy had come out and got into a car.

Simone was now disappearing round a corner, following the stretcher of Jonathan. It was as if Tom saw her already in a funeral procession. Tom turned and walked back to Reeves.

‚ÄúWe take off,‚Äù Tom said, ‚Äúwhile we can.‚Äù He wanted to take off before someone asked questions or made a note of his license number.

He and Reeves got into Tom‚Äôs car. Tom drove off, toward the Monument and home.

‚ÄúJonathan‚Äôs dead‚Äîdo you think?‚Äù Reeves asked.

‚ÄúYes. Well‚Äîyou heard the intern.‚Äù

Reeves slumped and rubbed his eyes.

It wasn‚Äôt sinking in, Tom thought, not to either of them. Tom was apprehensive lest a car from the hospital be trailing him, even a police car. One didn‚Äôt deposit a dead man and drive off with no questions asked. What was Simone going to say? They‚Äôd excuse her for not saying anything this evening, perhaps, but tomorrow? ‚ÄúAnd you, my friend,‚Äù Tom said, his throat hoarse. ‚ÄúNo bones broken, no teeth knocked out?‚Äù He‚Äôd talked, Tom remembered, and maybe at once.

‚ÄúOnly cigarette burns,‚Äù Reeves said in a humble voice, as if burns were nothing compared to a bullet. Reeves had an inch-long beard, reddish.

‚ÄúI suppose you know what‚Äôs at the Trevannys‚Äô house‚Äîtwo dead men.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Good.‚Äî Yes, of course I know. They‚Äôre missing. They never came back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd have gone by the house to do something, try to, but the police must be there now.‚Äù A siren behind Tom made him grip the wheel in sudden panic, but it turned out to be a white ambulance with a blue light on its roof, which passed Tom at the Monument, and whisked away in a quick right turn toward Paris. Tom wished it might have been Jonathan, being taken to a Paris hospital where they were better able to deal with him. Tom thought that Jonathan had deliberately stepped between him and a man‚Äôs gun in the car. Was he wrong? No one overtook them, or sirened them to a stop, in the drive to Villeperce. Reeves had fallen asleep against the door, but he woke up when the car stopped.

‚ÄúThis is home sweet home,‚Äù Tom said.

They got out in the garage, and Tom locked the garage, then opened his house door with a key. All was serene. It was rather unbelievable.

‚ÄúDo you want to flop on the sofa while I make some tea?‚Äù Tom asked. ‚ÄúTea is what we need.‚Äù

They had tea and whiseky, more tea than whiskey. Reeves, with his usual apologetic manner, asked Tom if he had any anti-burn ointment, and Tom produced something from the downstairs loo medicine cabinet, and Reeves retired there to dress his wounds, which he said were all on his stomach. Tom lit a cigar, not so much because he craved a cigar as because a cigar gave him a sense of stability, perhaps illusory, but it was the illusion, the attitude toward problems that counted. One simply had to have a confident attitude.

When Reeves came into the living room, he took note of the harpsichord.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúA new acquisition, I‚Äôm going to see about taking lessons in Fontainebleau‚Äîor somewhere. Maybe Heloise will take lessons too. We can‚Äôt go on twiddling on the thing like a pair of monkeys.‚Äù Tom felt curiously angry, not against Reeves, not against anything specific. ‚ÄúTell me what happened in Ascona.‚Äù

Reeves sipped his tea and whiskey again, silent for a few seconds like a man who had to drag himself back inch by inch from another world. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking about Jonathan. Dead.‚Äî I didn‚Äôt want that, you know.‚Äù

Tom recrossed his legs. He was thinking about Jonathan too. ‚ÄúAbout Ascona. What did happen there?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Well, I told you I thought they‚Äôd spotted me. Then a couple of nights ago‚Äîyes‚Äîone of these fellows approached me on the street. Young fellow, summer sports clothes, looked like an Italian tourist. He said in English, ‚ÄòGet your suitcase packed and check out. We‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äô Natch, I‚ÄîI knew what the alternative was‚ÄîI mean if I‚Äôd decided to pack my suitcase and run. This was around seven p.m. Sunday. Yesterday?‚Äù

‚ÄúYesterday was Sunday, yes.‚Äù

Reeves stared at the coffee table, but he sat upright, one hand delicately against his midriff, where perhaps the burns were. ‚ÄúBy the way, I never took my suitcase. It‚Äôs still in the lobby of the hotel in Ascona. They just beckoned me out the door and said ‚ÄòLeave it.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can telephone the hotel,‚Äù Tom said, ‚Äúfrom Fontainebleau, for instance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. So‚Äîthey kept asking me questions. They wanted to know the mastermind of it all. I told them there wasn‚Äôt any. Couldn‚Äôt have been me, a mastermind!‚Äù Reeves laughed weakly. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to say you, Tom. Anyway it wasn‚Äôt you who wanted to keep the Mafia out of Hamburg. So then‚Äîthe cigarette burns started. They asked me who‚Äôd been on the train. I‚Äôm afraid I didn‚Äôt do as well as Fritz. Good old Fritz‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not dead, is he?‚Äù asked Tom.

‚ÄúNo. Not that I know of. Anyway to make this disgraceful story short, I told them Jonathan‚Äôs name‚Äîwhere he lived. I said it‚Äîbecause they were holding me down in the car in some woods somewhere, giving me the cigarette burns. I remember thinking that if I screamed like mad for help, no one would have heard me. Then they started holding my nose, pretending they were going to suffocate me.‚Äù Reeves squirmed on the sofa.

Tom could sympathize. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt mention my name?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Tom wondered if he could dare believe that his coup with Jonathan had come off. Perhaps the Genotti family really thought that Tom Ripley had been a wrong trail. ‚ÄúThese were the Genotti family, I presume.‚Äù

‚ÄúLogically, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt mention the family, Tom, for goodness‚Äô sake!‚Äù

That was true. ‚ÄúNo mention of Angy‚Äîor Lippo? Or a capo called Luigi?‚Äù

Reeves thought. ‚ÄúLuigi‚Äîmaybe I heard the name. I‚Äôm afraid I was scared stiff, Tom‚Äî‚Äù

Tom sighed. ‚ÄúAngy and Lippo are the two Jonathan and I did in Saturday night,‚Äù Tom said in a soft voice as if someone might overhear him. ‚ÄúTwo of the Genotti family. They came to the house here, and we‚Äî They were incinerated in their own car, miles from here. Jonathan was here and he was marvelous. You should see the papers!‚Äù Tom added, smiling. ‚ÄúWe made Lippo phone his boss Luigi and tell him that I wasn‚Äôt the man he wanted. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you about the Genottis. I‚Äôm very interested to know whether it was a success or not.‚Äù

Reeves was still trying to remember. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt mention your name, I know. Killed two of them here. In the house! That‚Äôs something, Tom!‚Äù Reeves sank back on the sofa with a gentle smile, looking as if it were the first time he‚Äôd relaxed in days. Perhaps it was.

‚ÄúHowever, they know my name,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure whether the two in the car recognized me tonight. That‚Äôs‚Äîin the stars.‚Äù He was surprised at the phrase coming from his lips. He meant it was fifty-fifty, something like that. ‚ÄúI mean,‚Äù Tom continued on a firmer note, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether their appetites are satisfied by getting Jonathan tonight or not.‚Äù

Tom stood up, turning away from Reeves. Jonathan dead. And Jonathan hadn‚Äôt even needed to go out with Tom to the car. Hadn‚Äôt Jonathan deliberately stepped in front of him, between him and the pistol pointing from the car? But Tom wasn‚Äôt quite sure he‚Äôd seen a pistol pointing. It had all happened so quickly. Jonathan had never reconciled Simone, never had a word of forgiveness from her‚Äînothing but those few minutes of attention she had given him after he‚Äôd been nearly garroted.

‚ÄúReeves, shouldn‚Äôt you think about turning in? Unless you‚Äôd like to eat something first. Are you hungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm too bushed to eat, thanks. I‚Äôd really like to turn in. Thanks, Tom. I wasn‚Äôt sure you could put me up.‚Äù

Tom laughed. ‚ÄúNeither was I.‚Äù Tom showed Reeves up to the guest room, apologized for the fact Jonathan had slept for a few hours in the bed, and offered to change the sheets, but Reeves assured him that it didn‚Äôt matter.

‚ÄúThat bed looks like bliss,‚Äù Reeves said, weaving with exhaustion as he started to undress.

Tom was thinking, if the Mafia boys tried another attack tonight, he had the bigger Italian gun, plus his rifle, the Luger also, with a tired Reeves instead of Jonathan. But he didn‚Äôt think the Mafia would come tonight. They would probably prefer to get a great distance from Fontainebleau. Tom hoped he had wounded the driver, at least, and badly.

The next morning, Tom let Reeves sleep on. Tom sat in his living room with his coffee, with the radio tuned to a French popular program which gave the news every hour. Unfortunately it was just after 9 a.m. He wondered what Simone was saying to the police, and what she had said last night? She wouldn‚Äôt, Tom thought, mention him, because that would expose Jonathan‚Äôs part in the Mafia killings. Or was he right? Couldn‚Äôt she say that Tom Ripley had coerced her husband‚Äî But how? By what kind of pressure? No, it was more likely that Simone would say, more or less, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine why the Mafia (or the Italians) came to our house.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut who was the other man with you husband? The witnesses say there was another man‚Äîwith an American accent.‚Äù Tom hoped none of the bystanders would remark on his accent, but probably they would. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Simone might say. Someone my husband knew. I have forgotten his name . . .‚Äù

Things were a bit uncertain, at the moment.

Reeves came down before 10 a.m. Tom made more coffee, and scrambled some eggs for him.

‚ÄúI must take off for your sake,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúCan you drive me to‚ÄîI was thinking of Orly. Also I want to telephone about my suitcase, but not from your house. Could you take me to Fontainebleau?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can take you to Fontainebleau and Orly. Where are you headed?‚Äù

‚ÄúZ√ºrich, I was thinking. Then I could swoop back to Ascona and get my suitcase. But if I telephone the hotel, they might send the suitcase to Z√ºrich care of American Express. I‚Äôll just say I forgot it!‚Äù Reeves laughed a boyish, carefree laugh‚Äîor rather, forced it out of himself.

Then there was the money situation. Tom had about thirteen hundred francs in cash in the house. He said he could easily let Reeves have some for the plane ticket and to change into Swiss francs once he got to Z√ºrich. Reeves had traveler‚Äôs checks in his suitcase.

‚ÄúAnd your passport?‚Äù Tom asked.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù Reeves patted his breast pocket. ‚ÄúBoth of them. Ralph Platt with the beard and me without. Had the picture taken by a chum in Hamburg, me wearing a phony beard. Can you imagine the Italians didn‚Äôt take the passports off me? That‚Äôs luck, eh?‚Äù

It certainly was. Reeves was unkillable, Tom thought, like a slender lizard flitting over stone. Reeves had been kidnapped, cigarette-burnt, intimidated God knew how, dumped, and here he was eating scrambled eggs, both eyes intact, not even his nose broken.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going back to my own passport. So I‚Äôll shave off my beard this morning, take a bath too, if I may. I just came down in a hurry, because I thought I‚Äôd slept pretty late.‚Äù

Tom telephoned while Reeves was bathing, and found out about planes to Z√ºrich. There were three that day, the first taking off at 1:20 p.m., and the girl at Orly said there would very likely be a single seat available.





24


Tom was at Orly with Reeves a few minutes past noon. He parked his car. Reeves telephoned the hotel Three Bears in Ascona about his suitcase, and the hotel agreed to send it to Z√ºrich. Reeves was not much concerned, not as concerned as Tom would have been if he‚Äôd left behind an unlocked suitcase with an interesting address book in it. Reeves would probably recover his suitcase with all its contents undisturbed tomorrow in Z√ºrich. Tom had insisted on Reeves‚Äôs taking one of his small suitcases with an extra shirt, a sweater, pajamas, socks and underwear, and Tom‚Äôs own toothbrush and toothpaste, which Tom thought essential for a suitcase to look normal. Somehow Tom hadn‚Äôt wanted to give Reeves the new toothbrush that Jonathan had used only once. Tom also gave Reeves a raincoat.

Reeves looked paler without the beard. ‚ÄúTom, don‚Äôt wait to see me off, I‚Äôll manage. Thanks infinitely. You saved my life.‚Äù

That wasn‚Äôt quite true, unless the Italians had been going to plug Reeves on the pavement, which Tom doubted. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt hear from you,‚Äù Tom said with a smile, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre all right.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Tom!‚Äù A wave of the hand, and he vanished through the glass doors.

Tom got his car and drove homeward, feeling wretched and increasingly sad. He didn‚Äôt care to try to shake it off by seeing people this evening, not the Grais again, not the Cleggs either. Not even a film in Paris. He‚Äôd ring Heloise around 7 p.m., and see if she‚Äôd departed on the Swiss jaunt. If she had, her parents would know her telephone number in the Swiss chalet, or some way of reaching her. Heloise always thought of things like that, leaving a telephone number or an address where she could be found.

Then of course he might have a visit from the police, which would put an end to his efforts to shake off his depression. What could he say to the police, that he had been home all last evening? Tom laughed, and the laugh was a relief. He ought to find out first of course, what Simone had already said, if he could.

But the police did not come, and Tom made no effort to speak with Simone. Tom suffered his usual apprehension that the police were spending this time in amassing evidence and testimony before they dumped it on him. Tom bought some things for his dinner, practiced some finger exercises on the harpsichord, and wrote a friendly note to Mme. Annette in care of her sister in Lyon:

My dear Mme. Annette:

Belle Ombre misses you painfully. But I hope you are relaxing and enjoying these beautiful days of early summer. Everything is all right here. I will telephone one of these evenings and see how you are. All the best wishes.

Affectionately,

Tom

The Paris radio reported a ‚Äúshoot-up‚Äù in a Fontainebleau street, three men killed, no names given. The Tuesday paper (Tom bought France-Soir in Villeperce) had a five-inch-long item: Jonathan Trevanny of Fontainebleau shot dead, and two Italians also shot in Trevanny‚Äôs house. Tom‚Äôs eyes glided over their names as though he didn‚Äôt want to remember them, though he knew they might linger a long time in his memory: Alfiori and Ponti. The Italians had invaded the house for no reason that Mme. Simone Trevanny knew, she had told the police. They had rung the doorbell, then burst in. A friend whom Mme. Trevanny did not name had aided her husband, and later driven them both, with their small son, to the hospital in Fontainebleau where her husband had been found dead on arrival.

Aided, Tom thought with amusement, in view of the two Mafiosi with their skulls bashed in in the Trevanny house. Pretty handy with a hammer, that friend of the Trevannys, and maybe Trevanny himself, considering they had been up against a total of four men with guns. Tom began to relax, to laugh even‚Äîand if there was a little hysteria in the laugh, who could blame him? He knew that more details were going to come out in the newspapers, and if not the newspapers then via the police themselves‚Äîdirect to Simone, direct to him, maybe. But Mme. Simone was going to try to protect her husband‚Äôs honor and her nest egg in Switzerland, Tom believed, otherwise she would have told them a bit more already. She could have mentioned Tom Ripley, and her suspicion of him. The newspapers could have said that Mme. Trevanny promised to make a more detailed statement later. But evidently she hadn‚Äôt.

The funeral of Jonathan Trevanny was to be held Wednesday afternoon, 17 May, at 3 p.m. in the church of St. Louis. On Wed-nesday, Tom wanted to go, but he felt it would have been exactly the wrong thing to do, from Simone‚Äôs point of view, and after all funerals were for the living, not the dead. Tom spent that time in silence, working in his garden. (He must prod those blasted workmen about the greenhouse.) Tom became more and more convinced that Jonathan had on purpose shielded him from that bullet by stepping in front of him.

Surely the police were going to question Simone in the days to come, demand to know the name of the friend who had aided her husband. Hadn‚Äôt the Italians, maybe identified by now as the Mafia, been in pursuit of the friend, perhaps, not Jonathan Trevanny? The police would give Simone a few days to recover from her grief, and then they would question her again. Tom could imagine Simone‚Äôs will strengthened even more in the direction in which she had started: the friend didn‚Äôt want his name given, he was not a close friend, he had acted in self-defense, as had her husband, and she wanted to forget the whole nightmare.

About a month later, in June, when Heloise was long back from Switzerland, and Tom‚Äôs speculations on the Trevanny affair had come true‚Äîthere had been no further statements from Mme. Trevanny in the newspapers‚ÄîTom saw Simone approaching him on the same pavement in the Rue de France in Fontainebleau. Tom was carrying a heavy urnlike thing for the garden, which he had just bought. Tom was surprised to see Simone, because he had heard that she had already removed herself and her son to Toulouse, where she had bought a house. Tom had heard this news via the young and thrusting owner of the new and expensive delicatessen shop into which Gauthier‚Äôs art supply shop had been converted. So with his arms nearly giving out from the load which he had almost entrusted to the clerk at the florist‚Äôs, the unpleasant memory of c√©leri r√©moulade and herrings-in-cream in his mind instead of the as yet odorless tubes of paint, virgin brushes, and canvases that he was used to seeing in Gauthier‚Äôs premises, plus the belief that Simone was already hundreds of miles away‚ÄîTom had the feeling he was seeing a ghost, having a vision. Tom was in shirtsleeves, beginning to crumple, and if not for Simone, he might have set the urn down to rest for a moment. His car was at the next corner. Simone saw him and at once began to glare like a focusing enemy. She paused briefly beside him, and as Tom almost came to a stop also, thinking at least to say ‚ÄúBonjour, madame,‚Äù she spat at him. She missed his face, missed him entirely, and plunged on toward the Rue St. Merry.

That, perhaps, corresponded to the Mafia revenge. Tom hoped that would be all that there was to it‚Äîeither from the Mafia or Mme. Simone. In fact, the spit was a kind of guarantee, unpleasant to be sure, whether it hit or not. But if Simone hadn‚Äôt decided to hang on to the money in Switzerland, she wouldn‚Äôt have bothered spitting and he himself would be in prison. Simone was just a trifle ashamed of herself, Tom thought. In that, she joined much of the rest of the world. Tom felt, in fact, that her conscience would be more at rest than that of her husband, if he were still alive.
