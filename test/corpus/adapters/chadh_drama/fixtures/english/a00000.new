<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Certainly not, sir; good deeds in your office</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Exactly so. But now, Mr. Grimes, that your</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl ln="50">Why, if you can't, sir, there's no honour among</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>I believe you are grateful, Mr. Grimes, and will</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>True, sir, I have been obliged by you&mdash;<stage r="italic">[Aside.]</stage></pl>
<pl>to do many very dirty actions!</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>I have patronized you warmly; I evinced as</pl>
<pl>much interest in your welfare, as if you had been a rich</pl>

<pl>and I took you in.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>You did, sir&mdash;you took me in; and if I'd been</pl>
<pl>a rich client, as you say, you wouldn't have acted otherwise.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, Grimes, I think you know me, and you</pl>
<pl>know also what a professional man must be. In the law,</pl>
<pl>one who is a man of business must sometimes sacrifice</pl>
<pl>considerations both of feeling and honour.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes; and you are always in business, you</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>I confess it, Grimes; but a man in our profession</pl>
<pl>must put his heart in it: when I started in business, that</pl>
<pl>was my only capital.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>You did not risk much, then, sir.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, Grimes, never mind that; can I place</pl>
<pl>reliance in your fidelity?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Certainly, sir, as long as you are not in arrear</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Very well. Now I am going five or six miles from</pl>

<p><pl>Yes, sir.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, I shall want your assistance; for if Pluckwell</pl>
<pl>should gain the cause, I lose my costs.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Very well, sir.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Not at all very well. But the finding these deeds</pl>
<pl>would be the only means of Fleece being beaten.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Why not destroy them at once?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Not yet: I always think it prudent to have two</pl>

<pl>my client Fleece completely in my power.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>You wish them to be locked up, sir, till we</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>No, I cannot trust them out of my reach. Ssuppose</pl>
<pl>anything should happen in my absence, and my chambers</pl>
<pl>were to be either robbed or searched, the deeds would of</pl>
<pl>course come to light.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>There are very few lawyers would like all their</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Exactly, and these in particular; you must therefore</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Why, the fact is, though I have had the fullest</pl>

<pl>to have made you confide in me by this time.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>It is your length of service, under me, that is my</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, sir, you know best what I've learned</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>The thing is impossible; you must travel as if</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes, sir, it will look more respectable my not</pl>

<pb n="12">
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>No; a blue bag is lawyer&hyphen;like; and, consequently,</pl>

<pdiv><speech><stage r="italic"><speaker>Grimes.</speaker> [Taking down the carpet bag, and holding it to

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes; it will be the very thing. <stage r="italic">[Putting in deeds.]</stage></pl>

<p><pl>My master is a thorough scoundrel; practice,</pl>

<pl>and so he has no business to be honest; that's my</pl>

<pl>think it's my duty to do as I'm directed; I'm only an instrument</pl>

<pl>and if he had a clerk that wouldn't do as he was told, he'd</pl>
<pl>cut him also. I don't see that I'm to blame; I don't</pl>

<pl>it's only an affidavit. Besides, as it's law, they'll turn it</pl>

<p><pl>Yes, sir, but I am never called upon to rise: there</pl>

<p><pl>Harriet, my dear, the matter is of great importance</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Har.</speaker>
<p><pl>Then we may find cause to lament; but I am sure</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes, my dear, I will allow that Mr. Wrangle is a</pl>

<pl>produced, we are utterly undone.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Har.</speaker>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes, my dear, but the decision is one of great importance;</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Har.</speaker>
<p><pl>Oh, then, I've hopes, if it depends upon justice.</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl>Ah, my dear, your sex should not interfere with</pl>

<pl>Why, you young women will some day be wanting to</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl>Hold your tongue, my dear, I insist! I cannot sit</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Har.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well then, papa, let's drop the debate before we've</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl>And indeed it will; for arrive it must, unless some</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, well, it's no use, I see, talking seriously to</pl>

<p><pl>But the cause can't be good without the papers.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Har.</speaker>
<p><pl>Oh! I can't see the virtue there is in a parcel of</pl>

<pl ln="300">to despair!</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Coach.</speaker>
<p><pl>No, I have driven you to the assizes.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>That will do for you, coachman. Gentlemen, this</pl>
<pl>is a case of the most extraordinary kind; and, as the evidence</pl>
<pl>is circumstantial, great care should be taken in receiving</pl>
<pl>it. But, gentlemen, the manner in which the coachman</pl>
<pl>gave his testimony is so fair, that it is impossible to</pl>
<pl>doubt his word. Then, too, look at the suspicious manner</pl>
<pl>in which the prisoner brought to mind the sixpenny douceur</pl>
<pl>which he had given on his journey. Gentlemen, is it not</pl>
<pl>an aggravation of the prisoner's delinquency, that here, in</pl>
<pl>the very face of law, with justice emblemed in the magistrate</pl>
<pl>&mdash;with honesty typified in the whole bearing of Boots,</pl>
<pl>the chief promoter of the prosecution, and stern integrity</pl>
<pl>lowering in the features of the unbought coachman,&mdash;is it</pl>
<pb n="28">
<pl>not, I say, dreadful that an attenpt should thus openly be</pl>
<pl>made to suborn a principal witness? But it is unnecessary</pl>
<pl>for me to dwell further upon the evidence. The prisoner's</pl>
<pl>bearing is the most suspicious part of the case. There is,</pl>
<pl>in his appearance, a strong presumption of guilt. Look,</pl>
<pl>gentlemen, at his coat: does it not betray a capacity of</pl>
<pl>pocket adapted to his nefarious trade? Look at his trousers:</pl>
<pl>are those the trousers of an honest man? No! I</pl>
<pl>turn from them with horror inexpressible. But his hat,</pl>
<pl>gentlemen, his hat crowns all. When we look at his garments,</pl>
<pl ln="325">we must admit the man is in a dreadful case. With</pl>
<pl>these remarks, I leave the matter in the hands of the magistrate.</pl>
<pl>I think the case is clear.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl>Certainly, I must order the carpet bag to be opened,</pl>
<pl>unless the prisoner can give some better account of himself.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>Now, prisoner, what have you to say to the</pl>
<pl>charge?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Why, sir, the real truth of the matter is&mdash;</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Stop, young man! <stage r="italic">[Crossing to Grimes&mdash;aside.]</stage></pl>
<pl>Mind what you're about&mdash;no real truth, or you may criminate</pl>
<pl>yourself.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, then, the fact is, that I was coming&mdash;</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>Stop, young man: perhaps you can say satisfactorily</pl>
<pl>what it was that brought you down from London?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Why, the coach, sir.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Boots.</speaker>
<p><pl>What an ewasive answer!</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>Silence, Boots! you must not interrupt the course</pl>
<pl>of justice. Now, prisoner, proceed.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Gentlemen, I must allow things look suspicious</pl>
<pl>against me, and that in my remark to the coachman, I</pl>
<pl>was a little off the guard; but, gentlemen, I am innocent.</pl>
<pl>In reply to that gentleman's observations on my outward</pl>
<pl>appearance, what can I say? My coat is seedy, of course,</pl>
<pl>because it has been often sewn. Then my hat, gentlemen,</pl>
<pl>what is there in my hat? <stage r="italic">[Putting it on.]</stage> Why, only my</pl>
<pl ln="350">head! and I'm sure you will admit there's nothing in that.</pl>
<pl>Why should my opponent bring my clothes into the close</pl>
<pl>of his speech? But you may say, because I was shabby,</pl>
<pl>it was kind of him to give me a dressing. I know his object</pl>
<pl>was to wound me; but he has not succeeded in making</pl>
<pl>me smart. But I will drop this line of defence, and state</pl>
<pl>the facts. I was coming with that gentleman&mdash;no, I mean</pl>
<pl>this&mdash;my master, that is&mdash;this carpet bag; and I was told</pl>
<pl>by him&mdash;that is, I wanted not to let it go, because&mdash;the&mdash;</pl>
<pl>that is&mdash;there's something in it.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pb n="29">
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes, there is evidently more in it than meets the</pl>
<pl>eye; the excuse is very lame.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Boots.</speaker>
<p><pl>Not particularly lame, neither, sir; for it's all</pl>
<pl>Walker!</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><stage r="italic"><speaker>Plu.</speaker> [To Grab.]</stage>
<p><pl>Now, sir, what course do you recommend</pl>
<pl>your client to pursue? Do you not advise him to</pl>
<pl>open the bag?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Decidedly not, sir. I consider it an infringement</pl>
<pl>on the liberty of the subject: I had rather he should be</pl>
<pl>imprisoned six months.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, that's kind! What becomes of the liberty</pl>
<pl>of the subject, if I'm sent to prison?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Why, you still preserve your rights.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Curse my rights! If I'm imprisoned to maintain</pl>
<pl>them, I'd sooner not have one left.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Plu.</speaker>
<p><pl ln="375">If he refuses, I shall send him to Bridewell as a</pl>
<pl>vagabond.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Then we shall appeal.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>What's the use of appealing?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Why, it will give you reparation in the end.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>But what's the use of reparation in the end, if</pl>
<pl>I'm to be imprisoned in the beginning?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Will you leave the case with me?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes, if I can leave the punishment with you;</pl>
<pl>but as that can't be done, I'll stand it no longer&mdash;I will</pl>
<pl>open the bag.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>No, you don't; I cannot allow you, as my client,</pl>
<pl>to do such a thing.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>But why not? If the man is willing, what can</pl>
<pl>it matter to you?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>I should advise him against it, on general principles.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, but I shall get into a scrape, if I don't.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Never mind that: if I am your legal adviser, I do</pl>
<pl>all for the best; you may have private papers in your bag.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, sir, that is the man's own look&hyphen;out, if he</pl>
<pl>suffers them to be inspected.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>Very true, sir; but suppose other parties are concerned?</pl>
<pl>You know, sir, I can have only one motive, and</pl>
<pl>that is to see justice done.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Boots.</speaker>
<p><pl>Yes, sir; but justice an't to be done in no sich</pl>
<pl ln="400">manner.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Wra.</speaker>
<p><pl>Well, sir, but there can be no objection to let the</pl>
<pl>contents of the bag be inspected by Mr. Pluckwell, who is</pl>
<pl>a man of honour, and a magistrate.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pb n="30">
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>A magistrate is the last person who should open</pl>
<pl>the bag; but you, sir, who are a disinterested party, may, I</pl>
<pl>should think, inspect its contents, on a promise of secresy.</pl>
<pl><stage r="italic">[To Grimes, giving him the key.]</stage> Do you consent to this?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grimes.</speaker>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Grab.</speaker>
<p><pl>I tell you, sir, it only contains instruments.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>

<p><pl>If your story be true, there can be no harm in</pl>

<pl>Well, the man's story seems true enough: there is nothing</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker r="italic">Boots.</speaker>
<p><pl>Look inside, sir; I'm sure there's mischief; see</pl>
