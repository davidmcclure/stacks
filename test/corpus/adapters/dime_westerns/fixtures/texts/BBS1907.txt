CHAPTER I.
^ ‘ ''	TI-IE HIDDEN TREASURE.
^It was breakfast-time. The beans, cooked in an ash-hole duringhfte night, were turned into a large iron frying-pan and seasoned with a liberal supply of finely, sliced chili Colorado and reinforced with several chunks • of bacon. The p§m was then placed on the coals and permitted to simmer for half an hour. Buffalo Bill, the cook, was ready for the beans when the beans were ready for him. His coffee had been made and his hardtack had -been moistened'-in the delicious spring-water that bubbled from the ground not ten feet from the campfire.
•	Breakfast over, the king of scouts lighted his pipe and prepared for a restful, soothing smoke. But his period of enjoyment was rudely disturbed. He had taken hut a few puffs when a commotion, up the hill back of lnm caused him to spring tb his feet and grasp his rifle.
A shot rang out as he faced the hill, and he saw a horseman fall from the saddle, and saw also the form-of a man on foot, who gave a shout ,of triumph and then hurried toward the body of the person he had shot. He had the face of a human fiend. With his bowie-knife out and murder in his eyes, he gazed, gloatingly, on his prey and then raised his hand to strike.
But the blow was never given. A bullet shot from Buffalo Bill’s Winchester, and the assassin, without a cry, fell forward upon the body of his victim.
The king of scouts hurried up the bank, saw that the villain' was dead, and,: after thrusting the body aside, gave quick and sympathetic attention to the young horseman.	1
There was blood on the face, but there was breath in the body.
A hasty examination was succeeded by the remark:
*	“Stunned; that’s all; I rcckon.”
Water was quickly procured, and, after the man’s head and face had been bathed and a stimulant had been poured into the young man’s mouth he opened his eyes.
The sight of the honest, commiserating countenance of the' king of scouts caused the sufferer to exclaim in pleasure and relief:
“A friend you must be. I thank you, for you have saved my life.”
“Lie still a while,” said* Buffalo Bill, as the young man tried to rise. “You are not badly hurt, but you have lost considerable blood.”
“I forgot,” returned the other, with a faint smile.
“That scoundrel shot me. My head-”
■ “Your head is all right. The bullet grazed the temple
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
and plowed a little ridge in your scalp. I have bound up the wound and it won’t give you any trouble.”
“Where is the scoundrel?”
“If I were to give an honest opinion,” replied Buffalo Bill, “I should say that he is a present making the acquaintance of his master, Beelezebub Q. Satan, Esquire.”
“Dead?”
“Yes.”
The young man turned his head, saw the dead body of his enemy, and shivered.
“I am obliged, awfully obliged.” he said. “Now I may be able to take care of the other, the archfiend, the man who employed the villain you have put out of the way.”
Buffalo Bill whistled.
“So there’s another, eh ? Where is he holding forth ?” “In these hills somewhere. He' is probably chasing my companion.”
“What is it all about,” asked the king of scouts. “You have a story to tell. I’ll carry you down to my camp, give you something to eat, and afterward you shall tell me what brought you to these hills and why your life is in danger; that is, if you feel that I can be trusted.” “Trusted? What you have done for me proves you can be trusted. Besides, your face is your recommendation. Fd bank on that every time. What is your name, if I may ask?”
“William F. Cody.”
“Buffalo Bill 1” The- young man gasped. Then he added, with a joyous laugh: “Well, I should smile!”
In high spirits he allowed himself to be assisted to the camp. Leaving him by the fire, Buffalo Bill went up the hill again to secure the horse, which had not wandered far from the spot of the tragedy.
While on the hill the king of scouts scanned the country beyond, but saw no sign of a human being.
Returning to camp, he waited until the young man had partaken of beans and coffee, and then pipes were in order.
Taking stock of his guest, the king of scouts was most favorably impressed. The youn£ man was a fine specimen of physical manhood, and his handsome face expressed honesty and courage. He was nearly six feet in height and was admirably proportioned. He had a firm, clear-cut mouth and square, resolute jaws. Set in a shapely head, with close-cropped hair, were dark, hazel eyes, capable of exhibiting the tenderest or the fiercest emotions. The hair was dark-brown, and the mustache a shade lighter.
“My name,” he began, “is Herbert Strand, and my home is in Illinois, though I have not seen it for a year.
I am a lawyer, and, after practising in my native city for a year, I came to Wyoming to search for a hidden treasure.”
“Gold mine?”
"Yes, but not placer or quartz. The mine I am seeking, for I have not yet found it. is pieces of gold, and the amount exceeds fifty thousand dollars. If I recover the money my share will be one-half.”
"One-half? Why not the whole amount?”
“Because the gold belongs to a bank. It was stolen from the vaults, and the robbers took it to a place in the Rocky Mountains and concealed it. I am acting for .the bank officials.”
“You are an honest man,” was Buffalo Bill’s comment.
“If some other man found that money he would not likely recognize the claim of the bank.”
“Maybe not,” returned Strand composedly.
“How did you learn of the cache?” asked the scout.
“I got the story from a man I had defended in court. He was accused of murder, and, in spite of my efforts to save his heck, he was convicted and hanged. Before the execution he sent for me and told the story of the hidden money. He was grateful for what I had tried to do and wanted to exhibit his gratitude by showing me how I could put fifty thousand dollars in my pocket.
“He said that he was the last survivor of the gang that had robbed the bank. The money had been conveyed to a spot near an old cabin in the hills of Wyoming. He was sure it was now there, for his associates in the robbery had been caught and strung up by vigi-lants in less than a month after the money had been buried. He had escaped, but such was his reputation in Wyoming that for years he dared not set-foot in that territory.
“He gave me an accurate description of the spot where the loot was buried, and prepared a map showing the route to the place, and also furnished me valuable oral information.	^
“The hiding-place is in a canon, about thirty miles from the source of Bad Water Creek, and in the vicinity of Sioux Pass. To reach the canon an exceedingly rough section of country must be traversed. The route leads through bramble and brier, over rocks and rocky fords, and along dangerous precipices. This camp of yours, Mr. Cody, cannot be more than forty miles from the canon of gold.”
Buffalo Bill, who had been an attentive listener, here remarked:
“What about the canon ? Anything on it to distinguish it from other canons in these mountains?”
“There is an old log cabin upon it. It was used by prospectors many years ago, when an attempt was made to carry on mining operations in a country overrun wjj hostile Indians. . Not far from the cabin are beautiful meadows, sufficient for furnishing feed for hundreds o head of stock. There is plenty • of water, and it is ^ lovely, romantic region.”	Jj
“Where was the gold buried?”
“It was not exactly buried. It was deposited in decayed crotch of a large forked sycamore. The tree on the trail leading to thfc cabin, and distant from it about five hundred yards.”
“I know the tree,” said Buffalo Bill, his eyes sparkliagf* “That part of the canon is called Paradise Valley, have been there many times.”
The statement caused Herbert Strand’s eyes to spark e with delight.
“How jucky it was that I met you,” he said. “Nov^* if you will go with me to the canon I will divide "’it1 you.”
Buffalo Bill’s answer was in the form of a question and a most peculiar one.
“Are you a married man?” he asked.
Strand blushed. “No,” he said, “but-”
“You’re engaged, then?”
“Yes, and to the .sweetest girl in Denver.”
‘ Waiting to get this money before tying the knot, eh • “Yes. But what has my personal affairs got to c with the matter of your accompanying me on the term I have suggested?”
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
o
“Just this, Mr. Strand,” replied the king- of scouts in grave frankness, “I am not in need of money. I am not rich, but I- have enough. I will guide you to the canon, but I shall refuse to accept any payment for my services. My time is my own, and I shall be at liberty until next month, when the government will claim and receive my services as chief of scouts in an expedition against the Cheyennes over Indian Territory'way. Not a word,” as Strand was about to speak, “for the matter is settled. Now for your enemies. Why have you been followed and why was an attempt made to kill you this morning?”
“The attempt was made because two men knew that I had on my person the map describing the hiding-place of the gold. They wanted to possess it, and but for your appcarance on the scene in the nick of time they would have possessed it.”
“Friends of the man who gave you the map, I suppose?”
“They had been associated with him in several robberies, but he had' no love for them. They knew he had a gold-plant somewhere in the Rockies, and, after my ^conversation with him a few days before the execution, l^Pie of them, the one most to be feared, went in disguise to the prison, and, pretending to be a brother of the condemned man, was admitted to his cell. This man is known as Wall-eyed Hoskins. He has red hair and his face is one mass of freckles. He is a big, powerful man, and, in spite of his ugly appearance, is shrewd, intelligent, and courageous.”
Buffalo Bill’s mouth hardened.
“I know the fellow,” he said, “and he knows, me. I helped clean out a gang of desperadoes he captained, and I would have got him if he hadn’t jumped into the Yellowstone, as I supposed, to his death. It .was not until a year afterward that I learned that he had escaped with his life. He is a hard citizen, and if he is your enemy vour troubles are not yet ovei\ r
Herbert Strand was not uncomfortably affected by these words. He looked at the figure of the stalwart scout and smiled.
“I am not afraid of him as long as you are with me,” ^pas his response. He was silent a moment, and then continued: “I hope he has not killed my companion.”
“I had forgotten about your companion, Mr. Strand. Was he with you this morning?’*
“Yes. He was preparing breakfast—he is a negro, and a faithful one—when Wall-eyed Hoskins and his tool, Tim Blayde, rode down a hill toward us.
“One moment. How did these scoundrels, find out that you had the map ?”
“Wall-eyed Hoskins received the information from the condemned murderer at the time of the prison visit./ The prisoner, when asked if he would not reveal the hiding-place of the gold, said that he had given the information to his lawver in the shape of a map and certain instructions. He refused absolutely to draw another map, and Wall-eyed Hoskins left the prison resolved to shadow me and steal the paper.
“An hour after Hoskins’ visit to the prison the condemned man sent for me and told me he had been fool enough to tell Hoskins that I had the map. ‘You want to look out for that fellow,’ he said, ‘for he is a bad one. He has a partner. Jim Blayde, and they’ll try to do you.’ “I promised to be careful, and the warning had the effect of causing me to delay my trip to the Rockies. In-
stead of starting at once, I waited a whole year. Then, when I hoped that Wall-eyed Hoskins and his partner were not in the city, I set out. I needed a reliable man. who would be companion as well as servant, so I selected Ham Hampton, the janitor of the building in which was my office. Ham is a giant in size, and as honest as the day is long. He was glad to enter my service for the trip, and we would have made good headway if in passing through Nebraska I had not contracted fever. For many months I was an invalid and the time would have hung heavy on my hands if it had not been for the presence of Mary Wellington. But of her later on.
“At last the trip was resumed, and we—Ham and I—-were congratulating ourselves over the peacefulness of our journey when those two scoundrels made their appearance.
“Our horses were picketed near the camp-fire and each of us ran for his own. As 1 rode away I heard a shot, and, turning, saw Ham flourishing his rifle, and making for the creek that flowed through the ravine where we had camped. I continued along the ridge hoping that the negro would join me after a while. I had got a fair start, and was’ in hopes of getting entirely out of harm’s way when a rifle-bullet caught me and I tumbled from the saddle.”	\
“Blayde was on foot when he started for you, knife in hand. He must have dismounted when he saw you fall. But where is his horse? I did not see it when I went up on the hill.”
“It must have galloped back over the trail.”
As he spoke Buffalo Bill turned his head and looked along the ridge of the canon in which he sat. The thud of a horse’s feet had come to his ear.
His camp was off the main trail, and the horseman was following it.
“Wall-eyed Hoskins, by all that’s holy!” the scout exclaimed. “What has happened? He is giving'you the go-by and is riding in the direction of Paradise Valley. Can it be that he has learned where the treasure is?” Herbert Strand uttered a despairing ejaculation. “He has killed Ham,” he cried, “and stolen the map.”
“What!” exclaimed Buffalo Bill, regarding the young man in surprise. “Did the negro have it?”
“Yes. I gave it to him as a matter of prudence. In the event of our being followed and an attack being made upon me, I thought the map would be safer with Ham. I instructed him, if a pinch came and he found it impossible to aid me, to ride on, find the gold and restore it to the bank. Now I understand why Wall-eyed Hoskins did not pursue me. He saw Ham ride for the banks of the creek, leaving me to follow the trail, and he at once guessed the truth. He either killed or overcame Ham, found the map and then, having no further business with me,, took the trail for Paradise Valley.” Buffalo Bill, who had had his eye on the horseman while the young man was talking, now said:
“I have got a mustang that can give that bronco Hoskins is riding a ten-mile start and beat him to the valley.”
He arose, found and mounted his pony, and was surprised to observe that Strand had made no move toward his own animal.
“Are you not going with me?” he asked.
“No. I am going back to lbok for Ham. He may not be dead. He may be severely wounded and in urgent
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
need of assistance. He is a faithful fellow, and I am not going- to desert him, gold or no gold.”
The king of scouts nodded his approval of the resolve.
“Good,” he said. "Go back and I’ll wait for you on the trail somewhere.”
Herbert Strand watched the race between the scout and the desperado, and soon saw that Buffalo Bill's pony was much the faster of the twd animals. He was about to ride up the hill and proceed to the camp where he had that morning been surprised when the .head of Ham appeared just above the brow of the elevation. .
As his eyes met those of his employer the negro uttered a shout of joy.
“B’ress de Lawd, b’ress de Lawd, Misto Strand, dat you’s safe an’ soun’. I nebber expected dat I’d see yo’ ag’in in dis worl’. How come yo’ ter git heah? Whar de man what sabed yo’ ?”
The negro came down the hill, his head bound up with his bandanna and his face cQvered with blood.
“You are hurt, Ham/’ said Strand solicitously. “Not badly I hope.”
“Nuffin’ ter ’mount ter miffin’. Got a knock in mah hade, dat’s all.”
He sat down and sighed. “But dar’s some’f’n wus dan dat, Misto Strand. I done los’ mah map. Dat debbil’s imp, Hoskins, done cabbage it.”
‘‘How did it happen ?” asked his employer.
“Hawse done th’ovv me. I plotted ter ride to de crik ter fool dat Hoskins, mek him t'ink I got de map. Dat’s funny, when I did hab de map. But I sho’ wanted him ter come atter me. I thought he’d sartin’ sho' be my meat if he did. But dat contrapshus hawse ob mine done played me a mean trick. He stum’led an’ fell by de crik-bank, an’ I hit he groun’ head fus’. Dat was one knock I done got. Misto Hoskins gimme anudder, an’ w’en I opened mah eyes ag’in I was widout dat map.” “You ought to be glad that Hoskins did not kill you,” remarked Strand.
“I t’ink he was ob de ’pinion dat he hab satled mah bacon. But he didn’t know what dat ar hade ob mine is made ob. It can stan’ mo’ hard knocks dan he gib me.”
The young man told Ham what had occurred at Buffalo Bill’s Camp. The negro slapped his thigh in delight.
“Pat's all right,” was his comment: “Dat ar Buffalo Billium am wuth his weight in Bangle tigers. He catch dat Hoskins, sho’.”
“What’s that about Hoskins?” asked a rough voice on the hill above them.
Herbert Strand looked up with a start and saw three horsemen.
CHAPTER II.
IN THE HANDS OF THE SIOUX.
The horsemen were on the top of the hill, the man who had spoken in advance. All had evil faces, and Strand Ml a C'-td chill strike him as he looked at them.
. Th^y might be peaceably inclined, but the chances were that they were of the Hoskins breed.
Both he and Ham, rifle in hand, arose as the riders cnrriv down to the camp.
The leader, whose face was covered with a grizzled
beard, and whostf eyes were small and shifty, grinned wickedly as he halted in front of Strand and the negro.
“Buck,” he said to one of his companions, “we’ve struck it. Things air shore cornin' our way with a whoop.”
“Bet yer gizzard,” was the wheezy response. The speaker had a thin, cadaverous face, and his labored breathing betrayed the sufferer from asthma.
The three desperadoes, for such they evidently were, dismounted, keeping sharp eyes the while on the young man and his servant.
Strand watched the strangers with a foreboding of trouble. Standing each by his horse, they fell to chuckling, frequently exchanging winks.
Strand waited for the leader to make explanation of the coming of himself and companions.
After having filled his right cheek with hard-cut tobacco, the leader condescended to use his voipe.
“Kain’t size we unship, I reckon? Air dyin’ ter know what’s our little game, eh?” lie spat at a lizard and smilingly continued: “We air busted bankers seckin'tcr rekiver dough that war cribbed from us by a pirootical son of a sand-fiea by ther name o’ Wall-eyed Hoskins* Ye mils’ know ther coot, fer I hearn ye romancin’ abo® him as we war ridin’ down hyer.”
An inkling of the villain’s purpose crept into Strand’s mind. He was after the stolen gold and knew that Hoskins was engaged in the same undertaking. A desire to learn how the fallow had acquired information relating to the money and Hoskins’ journey induced him to ask this question: “What do you know ? Who told you that Hoskins was in search of hidden money?”
The desperado stroked his grizzled beard in evil satisfaction. He had caused the young man to partly exp°se his hand. Now the road was clear to obtaining what he most desired.
“I shore see no harm in lettin’ down ther bars. Xe air wantin’ a show-down, an’ ye shall hev it. We uns air no frien’s of Wall-eyed Hoskins. -He did us dirt years ago in savin’ his bacon by ther puttin’ of us in a hole. But that air is neither hyer nor thar. Up in Deadwopd t’other day we bumped inter Wall-eyed’s pard, Blayde. Jim hadn’t given us no double-cross, an’ tha^ fore we met as frien’s an’ rushed ther tansy until J,nl was as drunk as a biled owl.
“Ther feller meant ter be faithful ter Wall-eyed of account o' self-interest, but Jie plumb lost his bearin5 when ther bug-jnice preempted his think-works. gin away ther hull business, said as how he’n Wall-eye“ Hoskins war on ther trail of a brace of tendcrfeet what bed papers about ’em tellin’ whar thar war fifty thousat) dollars in shiners. Wall-eyed war then seekin’ ther tra* which lied been lost a few days afore an’ Jim war 1 Deadwood waitin' fer him ter show up.	.
“Arter havin' pumped Jim dry we uns hunted a h? an’ laid low ontil Jim an’ Wall-eyed started out ag11: They hed ther fastest nags an’ we’d about kincltid^ that they'd gin us ther slip when we hit a camp abov hyer an’ found signs of a scrap.	.
“Arter huntin’ around a while we found blood-ra^f ’ an' footprints, an’ follcrcd ther trail of ther party tn?* made ther tracks ontil we came to ther top of ther hi up yon’ an’ saw ther corp' of Jim Blayde. Air y° catchin’ on, young un?”
The question was followed by a chuckle that Strand wince. He glanced at Ham and observed
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
the negroe’s head was lowered and that his thick lips were working.
“I will admit,” the young- man said coldly, “that I have some idea of your meaning. You think I know where the gold is hidden.”
“Ye hev struck it,” was the quick, fierce response. “Jim Blayde told we uns that Wall-eyed Hoskins war arter a nigger an’ a white man. An’ hvar ye be. Now,” with a menacing gesture, “just trot out that thar map an’ ye kin go. No monkey bizness,” as he saw Strand finger his rifle, “or thar’ll be a circus.”
The two companions of the villain stood one on either side of him. The-left hand of eaclrgrasped a rifle. The right rested upon the handle of a revolver at the belt. Herbert Strand shrugged his shoulders.
“You are proceeding,” he curtly replied, “on the assumption that Hoskins has failed in securing the map. Let me inform .you that he has succeeded. The map was forcibly taken from my companion there more than an hour ago.”
“Ye lie an' ye know it,” snarled the villain. “Come, perduce ther paper or prepare ter hit ther flume.”
•Ham straightened up and looked fiercely at the taker.
“I have spoken the truth,” said Strand, with all the calmness he could muster. “Consider the situation. Where is Hoskins? If he had not secured the map would he not be somewhere about here?” He paused a moment, observed that his statement was having an effect, and then continued:” Go up the trail and you will find the tracks of Hoskins’ pony. He is now riding like the wind for the place where the gold is concealed. '
A chorus of oaths fell from the lips of the three desperadoes. The last of the trio, a short man with a red, pimply face and a flat nose made the air blue with his profanity. He wound up by saying:
“Let’s croak these yer meachin’ rickaboos an then search ’em. Maybe thar s been some lyin .
“Shut up. Pimply.” commanded the leader harshly. “Ye air allcrs goin’ oft half-cock. Ther white man is shore a gentleman an’ wouldn’t lie ter save his grandmother from ther stake.” There was silence for a short ®ie. It was broken by the leader. A thought that had come to him had caused the wrinkles to leave his brow.
“Ye say ther map is gone,” he said, addressing Strand. “That’s shore a big loss. But”—he leered at the young man—“ye know whar thar plant is all ther same. In course ye do. Ye wouldn’t pack that map fer months thout knowin’ every mark onto it. Ill bet a plug of hard cut agin a last year's bird s nest that ye kin go straight to ther spot whar that fifty thousand is planted.” Strand made no reply to this assertion. He looked steadily at the villain, his mine) made up as to the couisc he intended to pursue.
The villain scowled as he met the gaze of the young man, and his next words showed that he had lesolved to put an end to the conversation.
“Look hyar, mister tenderfoot, lie hissed. ^ Do ye 'guess what ye air buttin’ up against? My names Quick, Quicksand Quick—ever heered o’ me? I’m ther hombray that stood off a county o’ sheriff's deputies an' when five of 'em were sucked in by ther quicksands of ther North Platte, swam out an’ give ther mob ther graveyard snicker. I’m bullet-proof an’ water-proof. I kin tiiht mv weight in boh cats, an’ when T say a thing it shore goes, no matter whar ther lightnin’ is programmed ter
strike. An' my pards air feller hellions from Hellion-ville. Buck Swinny air a buster an’ Pimply Ben Aken is ther boss rifle shot in seventeen states. Take a squint at we uns an’ then prepare ter swallow ther dose I’m a-goin’ ter pour inter ye.”
“What is the dose?” asked Strand, with a cold smile.
“Fust ye must allow us ter s’arch ye an’ likewise that air coon fren’ o' vourn. Ef we don’t find ther map, an’
I ain’t a-countin’ on finclin’ it, ye both mus’ submit ter bein’ tied up a bit. That air operation bein’ done, ye’ll come along with us an’ show us whar ther gold is planted. An’ that’s ther program.”
“I have no objection to being searched,” said Strand. It was on his lips to say more, to say that he would not guide the villains to Paradise Valley, but he restrained the inclination to speak further. He would wait and hope for an intervention in his favor.
Before attempting to carry out his plan Quicksand Quick fixed his eyes on the negro, and said sharply:
“You coon, you, did my interestin’ remarks percooliate inter yer thick head?”
“Dey sho did, massa,” answered the negro humbly.
“I’m glad they did. Pass over yer gun ter Pimply.”
“Dat’s mah gun, massa,” returned Ham, his black face exhibiting acute distress. Yo’ sho’ wouldn’t tek it away from me. I done had dat gun seben yeah an’ de las’ time dat I use it, I killed de wuss scound’el in Wyoming.”
As he concluded up went the barrel like a flash and Pimply Ben struck the sod with a bullet in his brain.
Quick upon the report Herbert Strand sprang upon Quicksand Quick. He was too close to the villain to make instant and effective use of either of his weapons, and so was compelled to stake his life on a hand-to-hand struggle. The villain’s pistol exploded as the young man leaped, but the bullet missed its mark.
Quicksand Quick \vas a powerful man. but Strand was fully as strong as his adversary, and besides, possessed science that the border desperado lacked.
Ham Hampton had ducked upon sending forth the bullet that settled Pimply Ben, and the action was a wise one, for the other desperado, Buck Swinny. had fired as his evil associate was in the act of falling.
On his knees, Ham fired with his revolver, and then, without waiting to observe the effect of his shot leaped like a panther upon the asthmatic partner of Quicksand Quick.
The struggle was short. The negro was a giant in strength, and after he had choked his foe into insensibility he turned his. eyes upon the other two combatants.
Observing that the odds were in favor of hi* employer, he did not give his assistance in the work of overcoming the leader of the outlaws.
But as he occupied himself in tying up the thin-fa-'ed villain he kept an eye on Strand and Quick, ready to jump to the aid of the young man should the necessity for action arise.
Herbert Strand, however, was able to manage hi* fight without assistance. The struggle was a long and desperate one, but at last Quicksand Quick found himself upon his back with Strand 011 top orhim.
Now it was that Ham stood up with a reata in his hand.
“Dis’ll fix the debbil.” lu* said, nnd inside of five minutes the de>j■orado was bound hard a,id irist.
Strand rose to his feet puffing from his exertions.
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
His face was bleeding from scatches, but he had sustained no other injury. After wiping away the blood and bathing his face in the cold water of the mountain stream, he sat down and smiled at Ham. The faithful, courageous negro returned the smile.
“I owe our escape from a ticklish situation to you, Ham,” said the young man gratefully.
“I sho’ reckons dat yo’ med a mistook, Misto Strand.
If I hadn’t s’posed dat yo’ woulcl git away wicl dat debbel at yo’ feet I would’nt nebber hab cut loose wid mah Winchester.”
“Curse ye an ’yer Winchester/’ snapped Quicksand Quick, his wicked visage convulsed with rage. “I’d orter knowed that coons air treacherous. Ther next time ye won’t git off this yer way.”
“De nex’ time?” repeated Ham, mildly. “Ain’ yo* fo’gittin’ dat we—Misto Strand an’ mahself—am goin’ ter mek de p’ogram fo’ de nex’ time?”
“I know somethin’ that you two upstartin’ tenderfeet don’t know,” said Quicksand Quick composedly.
Strand regarded the villain sharply. What did he mean ?
“Don't give ther snap away,” put in Buck Swinny, who had recovered from the choking Ham had given him. “Keep it as a pleasant surprise.”
Strand looked at Ham and Ham blinked his eyes in wonder.
“Reckon dey got a secret dat ain’ goin’ do us no good, Misto Strand. Reckon, too, dat we better be gittin’ shet o’ dis place.”
“You’re right,” replied Strand. “They may be expecting friends. But if they do look for friends they won’t likely meet them.”
“What air ye goin’ ter do with we uns?” questioned Quick, with an expression of uneasiness.
“We are going to tie you on your horses and take you with us.”
“To the place whar the gold is?”
“Yes, you shall see the gold, and you shall also see us take it away.”
The two desperadoes were secured, each to the back of the horse he had ridden to the camp, and Strand and Ham were ^bout to mount their own animals, the negro having laid, claim to the horse that had recently been the property of Pimply Ben, when a party of Sioux that had been approaching noiselessly, rode rapidly down the hill.	#
Strand saw them, and, though the odds were as ten to one, he raised his rifle and blazed away.
Ham Hampton followed suit, and then followed a rush and a hand-to-hand conflict that ended in the death of half a dozen Indians and the subjugation of the brave white man and his equally brave companion.
Strand escaped a tomahawk to be stricken down with a pistol-shot in the breast.
Ham, covered with a score of wounds, was finally rendered powerless by a bullet in the neck.
Accompanying th© Indians was the medicine-man of the tribe, and at the command of the chief, a tall, sternfaced Sioux, of middle age, he dressed the wounds of the victims, so if they lived they might be burned at the stake.
The chief, who rejoiced in the name of Rushing Water, and who claimed to be a cousin of Rain-in-the-Face, the slayer of the brave Custer, spoke to Quicksand Quick as if the two were old friends:
“Why did the white man and the black man become the enemies of the friends of Rushing Water?” he asked.
“They are spies an’ they feared that we/knew it, an’ would inform Rushing Water,” was the reply.
“Then they must be friends of the great white warrior, Buffalo Bill. He was seen in these hills not many suns ago. Did my brother not know this?” he continued as he noted the look of alarm on the desperado’s countenance.
“No. I have not seen Buffalo Bill, an’ these spies said nothin’ about him. We war camped hyar an’ they surprised us.”
The conversation had been carried on in Sioux, and was understood by Herbert Strand, who, before starting for the mountains, had learned the language in order to make easier his journey to 1’aradise Valley. He had expected to meet Indians, and as matters were quiet his hope was that he would not be molested as he passed through the Sioux country.
The talk of Quicksand Quick enraged him. When the villain said that the negro and the white man had surprised him while in camp, he yelled:	^
“You lie, you scoundrel, and you know it.”
Rushing Water noted the pallor that suddenly overspread Quicksand Quick’s face, and then, with a queer smile on his usually stolid countenance, turned to where Strand lay, and said quietly: “The white man must not excite himself. He is badly wounded.”
Strand impulsively made reply: “It provoked me to hear that thief and liar talk to deceive you. This is our camp. He and his two companions came upon us and would have killed us or carried us off as prisoners if we. had not put up a successful fight. Ask him why he came into these hills?”
“The chief knows,” said the villain boldly. “I saw' him yesterday, and he knows that I waltzed down hyar tef see if thar wrar any enemies of his tribe.”
“My brother speaks with the tongue of truth,” remarked Rushing Water.
“And I tell you he is a liar. He came dow'n here to search for hidden gold. He thought I had a man showing where the gold is concealed and he wantedj^T1 steal it. Look at his face and see if it dpes not corrolx. rate my statement.”
The expression of Quicksand Quick’s face certainly did seem to prove that the wounded prisoner had spoken the truth.	- j
Rushing Water regarded the desperado with unfriendly eyes.
Strand went on quickly in order to strengthen the impression he had evidently made.
“I came into the country of the Sioux on a peaceful errand. I did not come to take away gold that is a p<lt*t of these mountains, but to secure gold that was stolen years ago from an Illinois bank. My purpose is t° restore the gold to the owners. It w7as the intention o\ this scoundrel who claims to be the friend of the chi*-1 to find the gold and keep it for his own use. He & friendly with the chief because he thinks he can use th*2 chief. But once he has put his evil hands on the gold will leave the land of the ,Sioux and Rushing Water wi> see him no more.”,	^
The young man ceased to speak. The chief tun^-to Quicksand Quick and said curtly:	. j
“The white prisoner has spoken "the truth. Quicksau

would have deceived Rushing Water in order that he might steal the gold that belongs to another.'’
“The prisoner is the liar,” weakly protested the cornered villain. “Give me the chance and I will prove that I am, indeed, the friend of Rushing Water and no liar.” “How can the man who was once my brother prove his words ?”
“By makin’ the prisoner own up that he war lyin’. Git him in shape fer a trial of wit an’ strength an’ I will show him that he is a bluffer.”
“I should think that one trial ought to be enough to satisfy you.” said Strand dryly.
The villain’s face flushed. "Ye took me by surprise,’’ he replied., ‘‘Gimme a fair show an’ we’ll see who’s who. We’ll fight fer the truth. Ther winner get’s the favor of the chief."
Rushing Water looked at the two men. “The truth must rise.” he said. “Rushing Water will, abide by the result. When the white prisoner is well, he shall meet Quicksand."
The desperado smiled. He was not anxious for another tussel with Strand, but he counted 011 gaining ^cmething by delaying the evident purpose of the chief.
might escape, get 011 the trail of Wall-eyed Hoskins, 'and force a division of the gold.
The thought of escape gave him courage. He tried his bonds and was rejoiced to find that they were not as tight as an expert would have made them.
But presently his face clouded. Rushing Water had said that Buffalo Bill was in these hills somewhere. Wrhat if he had met Wall-eyed Hoskins? The villain knew that Hoskins was wanted for murder and robbery, and that the man who wanted him most was the king of scouts. Perhaps Buffalo Bill had trailed Hoskins into the Wyoming hills.
Herbert Strand was lying where he could see Quicksand Quick’s face. He noted the changes of expression and saw that the villain was worried. A desire to aggravate him made him say:
“It’s no use, Quicksand, you’ll never see that money.” “I stand a better chance than- you do,” replied the s^ther sullenly.
B^p'If you knew who is on the way to the spot of concealment you would- sing a different tune,” said Strand quietly.
The villain’s wicked countenance twitched. His fear, he thought, was to be realized in the next words of the young man.
‘‘Who—who is ther hombray that is arter ther gold ?” he questioned huskily.
Strand laughed. “A man,” he replied, “who was never known to fail in an undertaking. Perhaps you have heard of William F. Cody.”
The instant the words left his lips Strand would have given much to recall them. In announcing that Buffalo Bill was not far away he had placed the daring scout’s life in jeopardy. Quicksand Quick would inform Rushing Wrater, and the Indians would, in all probability, follow the trail taken by Hoskins, in the belief that it would lead to the man who was feared more than an army of soldiers.
He was intensely relieved, therefore, when he heard the villain say:
“Don’t give this yer snap away ter Rushing Water. Me V you may make a deal.”
Strand’s face exhibited astonishment and contempt.
At this juncture the chief came up and said:
“My braves will remain here until the wounded white prisoner is able to ride a pony. Then the march will be taken to the place which the palefaces call Paradise Valley.”
Herbert Strand turned his face away, so that Quicksand Quick might not observe his agitation.
“Paradise Valley?” queried Quick. “Whar’s that?” “A day’s journey toward the west. There the White Queen will meet Rushing Water and tell him what must be done with the white men who call each other liars.” Strand fixed his eyes 011 the chief in a stare of wonderment. “The White Queen? Who is she? And how comes it that a white woman is queen of the Sioux?” “She is a prisoner, and is called queen because she acts like one and talks with a straight ^nd a wise tongue.”	*
“How long has she been a prisoner?”
“Two moons.”
“Where was she captured?”
“Near Lone Tree.”
“That’s a day’s ride from Denver,” said Strand, more to himself than to Rushing Water.
CHAPTER III.
THE PLIGHT OF THE WHITE QUEEN.
All that day Herbert Strand’s thoughts were on Buffalo Bill. Had he overtaken Wall-eyed Hoskins, and had he reached Paradise Valley? And if he had come to the little valley near which the gold was hidden, what had he found there? Rushing Water’s statement seemed to indicate that the place was in possession of the Sioux. The White Queen was there, a prisoner, and that meant that her guards were Indians.
The king of scouts might not have known of the Indian occupancy of the valley, and, besides, there was the possibility that he had been captured.
“If I were only free,” he said to himself, “I would set out for the valley. Buffalo Bill has risked his life for me, and I would be unworthy to bear the name of man if I did not try to repay the great sacrifice he has made.”
The night came, and with it black darkness. There was no moon, and the sky was overcast with heavy rain clouds.
Strand lay near Quicksand Quick, and in the middle of a circle of Indians. No fire had been lighted, for Rushing Water did not desire to play into the hands of such a dreaded enemy as Buffalo Bill.
Toward midnight, the young man, whose wound greatly pained him, heard Quick whisper:
“If I git ye free, will ye stand in?'”
_ “You fool,” was the answer, “don’t you know that I won’t be able to move for a week?”
“Ye won’t hcv ter move niore’n half a mile. I’ll pack ye. I know a dandy hidin’-place. We’ll stay thar ontil ye air well enough ter mosey goldwards.”
The nearest Indian was more "than twenty feet away, and the whispering had not been overheard.
“I prefer to take my chances with Rushing Water,” said the young man coldly.
But the villain was not taken aback by this reply. He continued:
"Ye kin resarve yer say-so. I’ll git ye outer this an’ nurse ye back ter health. Then ye kin. clo as ye please about standin’ in on a whack-up. That ar’ a go ?” Strand considered. If he remained a prisoner of Rushing Water, his death might be ordered, for he had killed two or three members of the chief’s band. If he allowed Quicksand Quick to take him away, he might be able to get the better of the villain.
But there was Ham Hampton, fre could not be left behind. The negro must be freed as well as his employer.	'
“I will accept your proposition,” he whispered, “if you will also set free my companion.”
"Too risky,” was the reply. “It’ll be a ticklish job ter git ye away. Takin’ ther coon along would mean giftin' diskjyered an’ tomahawked.”
“Then your offer is declined.”
The villain stifled an oath and said no more.
But he had not given up hope of carrying Strand away. If possible, he would take the young man from the Indian camp in spite of the refusal to go.
Long and determined tugging at the leathers about his wrists had borne the desired result. The villain’s hands were free. Then, without exciting the suspicion of the Sioux guards, he cut the cords that bound his ankles.
At one o’clock all the Indians but one were asleep. This fact "was not surprising, as they all believed that the prisoners, with the exception of Quicksand Quick, were physically incapable, through -wounds, of getting away from the camp, even if they could succeed in breaking their bonds. The Indian who stayed awake had been instructed to watch Quicksand Quick. When assured by the heavy breathing that the other Sioux were in the land of dreams, he moved closer to the villain.
Quick became awafre of the movement, and chuckled silently. He would not have to go to the Indian. He would make the Indian come to him.
Guard and prisoner were not more than three feet apart When the villain rose to a sitting-posture and raised his left hand.
The action showed the Indian that Quick had freed his hands. He at once leaped'upon the prisoner’.
The villain was ready for the onslaught, and the leap was met with a right-hand knife-thrust that caught the Sioux in the throat and prevented the utterance of a single cry. Another thrust, and the bloody deed was done. The murderer lay still for several moments. Hearing no movement of the other Indians, he breathed a sigh of relief.
A moment later he was crawling toward the form of Herbert Strand.
The young man was 'wide-awake, and knew that something had happened, but he did cry out when he found Quicksand Quick bending over him.
His position was a most peculiar and perplexing one. and before he could make up his mind how to act, a gag was inserted into his mouth, and the time.for action passed.
The villain, having silenced Strand, laid himself beside the form of the young man, and did some thinking.
Should he take along with him Buck Swinny, as well as Strand, or should he leave Swinny behind ?
“If I take Buck,” he thought, with puckered brow, "I’ll shore hev ter cut my slice in half. No, ther slice hev got ter be ther hull hog. Buck stays hyer.”
He crawled over to Swinny and whispered these words in his ear:
“I’m 'goin’ ter git ther tenderfoot outer danger, an’ then I’ll sneak back an’ do ther same by ye. It won’t be safe ter take ye both away at ther same time. So, say nothin’, Buck, an’ ye’ll be on velvet inside o’ half an hour.”
• Swinny had the faith to believe that his partner was acting squarely, and so whispered back that he was satisfied.
Close to Quick’s comrade lay Ham Hampton. He heard what the arch-villain said, and guessed the game that was on foot. He had just succeeded in breaking his bonds, and if Quick had come to Swinny a minute later, he would have discovered what Ham had done.
But as it was he went from Swinny to Strand in the comforting belief that everything was coming his way.
The Indians were still sleeping. Making sure of the fact, the villain proceeded to roll the helpless form of Herbert Strand toward the opening in the circle of guards left by the departure of the Indian who had been killed.
The point was at the top of a.slight elevation. Ba* low it was the stream of water that flowed through canon.
It was reached in safety, and soon the villain and lus victim were near the water.
It was Quick’s intention to cross the stream, ascend the hill on the other side, and then make his way to a cave he had discovered some time before, while fleeing from the soldiers who wanted him for many 'crimes.
After him, with the noiselessness of a panther, stole the faithful negro.
Quick stopped a while at the summit of the hill, to take a needed rest. Strand was no lightweight, and the villain’s face was reeking with perspiration when he reached the summit.
His eyes were turned in the direction of the Indian camp, and the stillness that pervaded the spot put an easy feeling into his mind.
At that moment Ham Hampton was behind a rock not fifteen feet below him.
The negro had been wounded in the fight with Ru^J ing Water’s braves, but none of the .wounds gave hT..J any trouble. The one in the neck had proved to be a mere puncture of the flesh, and had been dressed by the medicine-man, and, .except for a little soreness, did not bother him any.
After resting five minutes, Quicksand Quick arose and, stooping, would have agtiin lifted the body of his prisoner if the negro had not acted. A right-hander that would have'felled an ox caught the desperado behind the ear and sent him to earth minus sense and breath.
He was gagged and bound before he realized what, had happened to him.
The gag and leathers from Strand were removed, and then Ham whispered:	, ~	,
“Trus’ me, Misto. Strand. We’ll get dar, sho’ as y° . bawn.”
Strand smiled and pressed the black hand of his i*cS cuer.
“You are a jewel, Ham,” he said. “I shall never f°r/ get this.”
He permitted the negro to lift him, and along } . summit went the faithful black with his burden. A*

a while Ham descended to the bed of the canon. It was necessary that the trail should be hidden, for when morning came the Sioux would be out searching for the fugitives.
Ham found the water in the stream was low, and entering it, waded for over a mile. The direction he was going was nearly on a line with that taken by Wall-eyed Hoskins and Buffalo Bill.
The negro took it purposely, for he thought that the Sioux would not suspect that the fugitives bad gone toward Paradise Valley, where there were more Indians.
Rather, he reasoned, would they suppose the fugitives had gone in a direction that would take them out of hostile country.
Toward morning Strand and his companion found themselves in a region of massive rocks. Trees wfcre few, and the head of the canon was not far beyond them.
They were off the trail to the valley, but Ham believed lie knew where it was.
In a spot that concealed them from observation from
* sides, & long rest was taken.
'he question of food would not bother them for a uay, as their wallets were filled with jerked beef and hardtack, and there was plenty of water in the vicinity.
When daylight came Ham examined Strand’s wound. It was on the right side, and gave the young man considerable pain.
The negro removed the bandage that had been placed over the hurt by the medicine-man. What he saw caused him to chuckle. A few inches below the wound a hard substance was embedded in the flesh, just beneath the skin. It was the bullet. Deftly cutting it out, Ham said:
“Yo’ sho’ ought ter be tickled ter deff, Misto Strand. All dat pain yo’ been a-habin’ come fum de soahness ob de ribs an’ de presence ob dat piece ob lead. De bullet didn’ punctuate yo’ body, 110 sah. It come bang agin’ a rib, an’ den sashayed an’ shot fo’ de surface. Yo’ll be all right befo’ two days are ober.”
^This was good news, and Strand rejoiced greatly.
felt much better after Ilam had given the wound a cold-water dressing and had put on another and a softer bandage.
While Ham was away procuring water with which breakfast might'be washed down, the young man took from his pocket a letter and read it for the fiftieth time.
It was dated Denver, June 10, and it was now Seo-tember.
“Dear Herbert,” it ran, “I am sorrier than words can express not to be able to visit you again. The doctor told me yesterday-—he ITtis many patients in Denver, you know—that you were out of danger. This knowledge takes the sting out of my desertion. The serious illness of my cousin, Judy Compton, is what is taking me away. She lives on a ranch near the Wyoming line, and it will take over a day to get to her. Two of my father’s vaqucrps will accompany me, one to drive the buckboard, the'' other to ride ahead and see that the road is safe. Good-by until next we meet. Come to me at Denver when your quest is over. With all my love,	Mary Wellinton ”
‘‘When I stopped at Denver, on my Way here/’ said
Strand to himself, “the Wellington house was shut up. They told me at the next house that Mary was still absent, and that Mr. and Mrs. Wellington had gone to New York. I would have, ridden to the ranch, but it was out of my route, and I had already lost so much time that it seemed an act of folly to deliberately proceed to lose more. I wish_now that . I had gone to the Compton place.”
The not very appetizing breakfast was over, and Ham was standing looking .over the rocks down the canon when he uttered an ejaculation of alarm.
“What is it?” asked Strand, who was sitting down. “Injuns—two ob de cusses cornin’ dis way. An’ look, up whar Ah reckoned dat de trail gwine ter be, dars de res’ ob dem. I onnerstan’s, Misto,Strand. De ole chief he ain’t berleeb dat we done gone dis way, but he sho’ ain’t goin’ ter tek no chances, so he sen’ dem two debbils ter foller de bed ob de kenvon. Dat way he mek sho’ dat we ain’ heahabout nowhars.”
This was disturbing intelligence. Strand signed on account of physical incapacity.
“Mebbe dey won’t ’zamine dis place,” continued Ham. “We’s ’tween two big rocks, an’ de water is a quarter ob a mile away.”
“We can’t do anything but wait,” remarked the young man, with a sorry attempt at a smile. “So let’s lie low and hope for the best.”
The moments passed, and soon the two Indian scouts were seen standing not thirty yards from the fugitives’ place of concealment, and looking undecidedly toward it.
“If dey come dis way, we’ll get dem, sho’ as shoot-in’!” whispered Ham.	(
“Yes,” replied Strand, “and the shots will show the main body of Sioux where we are.”
The scouts came to a decision. They, moved toward the rock refuge, but not together. One walked straight for the rocks, the other described a half-circle.
Strand was ready for business, though he felt that the death of the two. Sioux would bring disaster upon himself and his black companion.
A noise on the rocky eminence above them caused the negro to turn his eyes for a second in that direction. He saw three Indians stealing for the hiding-place. They must have been signaled by the two on the other side of the rocks. The fugitives were in a most dangerous predicament.
“Dey’s cornin’ from de trail,” said Ham, in a low whisper. “We’s all in, I reckon.”
The nearest of the two scouts was now within range ' of Ham’s rifle. He fired, and the Indian fell. The next instant Strand brought down the other scout.
The shots surprised and confused the three Indians who had come from the main body. They ^topped, hesitated, and might have retreated if they had not seen a dozen of their comrades leave the trail to come to their assistance.
A few minutes would bring the reenforcements to them.
Dropping behind ro£ks, they waited.
The oncoming savages were within speaking-distance of the trio, when their progress was stopped by an attack that was unlooked for.
A Winchester rifle belched in alarming repetition, and the bullets came from a point not far from the place where the three Indians were concealed. No one could be seen, and when the number of dead had been in-
no
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
creased to five, the reenforcing band broke into wild . confusion and made for the trail.
“A friend has come to our aid,” said Strand exult-ingly. “And he is a wonder, whoever he is.”
They soon saw the figure of their savior. He was striding toward them, rifle in hand.
It was Buffalo Bill, and his way would take him close to the hiding-place of the three Indians.
Ham Hampton raised his head and shouted:
“Look out, Misto Cody. Dar’s Injuns hidin’ jus' about whar yo’ be.”
The king of scouts dropped to the ground as these warning words were uttered.
It was well that he did so, for a bullet cut the air over his head as he went down.
Buffalo Bill had not observed the direction from whence the shot had come, but Ham had been more fortunate. He had the shooter located, and while the king of scouts was lying on the ground, his eves roving hither and thither, the negro left the rocky refuge and boldly stepped toward the savage’s hiding-place.
As he walked he pointed his finger for the benefit of Buffalo Bill. The Indian whose life was threatened was in a dilemma. If he shot at the negro, he would be shot by Buffalo Bill. He could liope for no help from his comrades, for they were in a hole at the base of a monster boulder, and to shoot they would have to show themselves.
There was but one thing to do. He rose, elevated his .hands, and shouted:
“Me surrender!”
“Tell your fellow reds to follow suit,” commanded Buffalo Bill, “or else we will send you all a-kyting to the happy hunting-grounds/’
The Indian complied, and the two Sioux came out of their hollow and surrendered.
Their weapons were appropriated, and they were bound hariri and foot.
“Where is Strand?” asked the king of scouts, as the work of tying was going on.
“Here,” was the reply, and looking up, the scout saw the pale countenance of the young man from Illinois. “You’ve been hurt?” he said.
“Nothing to speak of. Mr. Cody. I’ll tell you about it later. Look at those Indians on the trail. The chief is evidently preparing for a descent upon us with his whole force. Shall we stay here, or will it be better to retreat?”
“Where will we retreat to? I know of no better place than this in which to make a stand. These rocks make fine shelter.”
"The safest spot is between those boulders.” pointing to the place he had just left.
“All right. We’ll go in there. And,” he added, “these redskins will go in with us. We may find use for them.” There was a natural barricade on three sides. The fourth was soon relieved of its weakness.
“'If it were not for the opening at the top, and the rpiick way in which we can topple over the rocks we have just piled up,” remarked Buffalo Bill, “we would be like rats in a hole. As it is, we can, I think, make it very interesting for the Sioux shouldc they come down to attack our fort.”
Strand was anxious to know how the king of scouts chanced to be in the canon among the rocks, but he felt that now was not the time for explanation.
Buffalo Bill must have guessed what was going on in the young man’s mind, for he said, after he had looked long at the group of Indians on the trail:
“You are wondering, doubtless, what brought me here, and whether I succeeded in overhauling Wall-eyed Hoskins. I can tell the story without losing sight of the enemy on the trail. In my opinion-, Rushing Water is bothered, and it will take some time for him to decide upon a plan for routing us out of this natural fort.
“Did I meet Hoskins? No. Something occurred whfich induced me to postpone the interesting event. The beggar nearly killed his pony trying to keep out of rifle-range, but I would have got him if he had not come up with a small band of Sioux. Hoskins is a renegade, and the redskins knew him, and greeted him as a friend.
“There was a long confab on the trail, and when Hoskins pointed, back toward the spot where he had iast seen me, I was not in sight. I had dismounted, and was making swift time for a place that would permit me to hear what the presence of the Indians meant. The rocks and the overhanging bluff upon which the rascal and the redskins stood enabled me reach the place without having been spotted.	£
“The talking was going when I got there, and I soori learned that it was the opinion of Hoskins and the Indians that I had back-tracked on seeing the reds, and was now making the dust fly for the people I had left
behind.	,	. t ,
“Hoskins had not told the savages that he was on a chase for hidden gold. Not he. It is his aim to collar the dinero and strike for civilization. I’ll gamble he intends, if he makes the riffle, to hike for Idaho, and from there go to Oregon and British Columbia.”
“Then he may secure the gold,” said Strand disappointedly.
“He may, yes, but there’s a chance that he won’t. We are still on deck, although our ship is threatened with stormy experiences. Paradise Valley is occupied. There are half a hundred Sioux there, the larger part of Rushing Water’s band. The valley has been headquarters for the redskins for several months.”	.
“We might as well go back,” was Strand’s comment, “that is, if that gang of murderers on the trail will permit tfs to do so.”
“It is for you to say,” replied Buffalo Bill quietly. “But if I were running this circus, I would not give up making a determined attempt to balk Wall-eyed Hoskins’ game.”
“What chance have we?” asked Strand impatiently-“Our chance lies in strategy. I have no plan, as ycL but one may come to me. That is a matter for future consideration. Our present business lies with Rush' ing Water and the braves who are in sight.”	,
Strand took heart from Buffalo Bill’s manner and words.
‘Til stay with the works,” he said impulsively. “Vo*-1 lead, and Ham and I will follow.”
Buffalo Bill looked his satisfaction at this resolve. “Did the Indians whose talk you overheard say afl) thing about a white woman who is a prisoner in Par£„ dise Valley, and who is known as the White Queen* questioned the young man, after a pause.	tf . e
1 he kin" of scouts showed astonishment. “No, 1 returned. ‘A white woman at the valley? What do y° know of her?”
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
Strand told the scout what Rushing Water had said. “That settles it,” was Buffalo Bill's response. “The woman must be rescued.”
CHAPTER IV.
TIIE PLAN OF THE SERPENT.
“If we can’t spoil Wall-eyed Hoskins’ game,” continued the king of scouts, “we’ll save that woman, or know the reason why.”
“I'm with you there, Mr. Gody,” said Herbert Strand. “Hang the gold! We’ll not consider that until we have done our best to rescue the White Queen. I wonder what her real name is, and whether she is young or old ?”
Buffalo Bill smiled. “Old or young, it’s all the same to me, Strand. But, of course, she is young. Indians do not make queens out of old women.”
“I think you must have misunderstood what I said,” responded the young man coldly. “Like you, I would fight for her, whether she is one hundred or twenty years
Wkl”
know it, my boy,” was the earnest reply, “so there is no cause for a grouch.”
“De Injuns, lUisto Cody!” exclaimed Ham, as he ' touched the king of scouts on the sleeve. “See, dey are mobin’.”
Buffalo Bill looked, and saw that a dozen Sioux had left the group and were riding down the trail over the route that Rushing Water and his body-guard had traveled but a short time before.
And as they rode, tlie main body, headed by the chief, went on toward Paradise' Valley.
“What does it mean?” asked Strand, in marked curiosity.
“It means/’ replied the king of scouts slowly, “that the plan for getting us-in a worse hole than the one we are now in has been made. The Sioux who are riding down the ridge will, if they get the chance, attack us from the rear. Probably they have been instructed to ^ait until nightfall before beginning operations. If we to leave here before night, they will count on having the advantage, for they can hide among the rocks and pot us as we go down the canon.”
“It would be an act of foolhardiness to retreat down the canon,” said Strand.
“Certainly it would, but if I have figured the thing out rightly, Rushing Water believes we will be compelled to take that way—that is, if we conclude not to make a stand here. Don’t you see? Rushing Water knows that if we leave the shelter of these rocks and make our way up the canon, we will fall into the hands of the savages at Paradise Valley. He would not mind' if we did go up instead of down, but I don’t believe that he has the remotest idea that we will do so.”
Ham grinned. “I sho’ reckons what yo’ do, Misto Cody,” he said. “Yo’ done mek a fool ob dat Injun.”
“I may surprise him, Ham, and if I do, luck has got to get in and favor me. I am sorry that Strand isn’t in good condition for leaving.”
“I’m not on the hospital-list by a large majority,” protested the young man. “You wouldn’t consider my hurt worth mentioning. Now that I know its character, I feel fit for anything. Nothing like mind-cure when
the leading members of the body are in shape for business.”
“That is the way to talk,” said Buffalo Bill approvingly. “As soon as those Indians down the trail are out of sight we will move.”
Ten minutes passed, and the time came for action.
The three friends left the rocky shelter, and under cover of some boulders reached the head of the canon. The Indian prisoners were left behind, for no other disposition could be made of them.
The spot was a mile distant from the point of departure, and a fetjv rods from the trail which led to Paradise Valley.
Leaving Strand and the negro, Buffalo Bill wrent to the place where he had left his pony.
It was in a hollow behind a hill, where there were several spruce-trees, and could not be seen from the ridge. The king of scouts was moving cautiously toward the spot when the sound of voices caught his ear. Surprise presently gave place to the liveliest satisfaction.
The voices were familiar, and proceeded from the lips of white men.
Buffalo Bill crept nearer to the hollow, and soon was in position to see two stalwart frontiersmen seated in the hollow. They were playing cards, and seemed to be utterly oblivious of danger.
“I have a good notion to teach them a lesson,” said the king of scouts to himself. “I have heard of reckless indifference, but this exhibition takes the persimmon.”
By the side of each player lay a rifle. The muzzle of each pointed toward the entrance to the hollow.
The king of scouts noting the absorption of the players had hopes that his scheme would succeed.
Watching Tiis opportunity, he crawled behind a tree close to the entrance, and then, taking advantage of a favorable moment, softly pulled toward him one of the rifles.
The players were then looking at each other with smiling intentness. The game was poker, and one of the players had just raised a bet made by the other.
“Kinder binding, eh?” remarked the man who had done the raising.
The other shuffled his cards for the third time, and as he did so the second rifle was abstracted.
“I call yer,” said the gambler.
“And I call both of you,” sang out Buffalo Bill, in a disguised voice, and without showing himself. “Elevate your fists, for I’ve got you foul!”
The players whipped out their revolvers and faced the entrance. They could not see the person who had surprised them, and it was not the part of wisdom for them to attempt to leave the hollow.
Shamefaced, they looked at each other, the loss of the rifles having been discovered.
“Wouldn’t it be good policy for you two-tenderfeet to lay down your pistols?” sarcastically suggested the unknown.
“Curse you, whoever you are!” snarled the taller of the two players. “Come out of hiding, and we’ll soon see who is the best man!”
“Why don’t you shoot?” said the other player quietly. "Are you afraid you might miss?”
“No,” returned Buffalo Bill, with a deep chuckle. “1 am not afraid. But, all the same, to shoot would be risky. I am the boy who never takes risks when he can

avoid them. I’ll tell you what I will do. I'll fight the both of you, one at a time. Not with guns, though. With fists. What do you say?”
The voice was still disguised. The tone was insulting.
“I’m your man,” quickly responded the taller of the players.
“That let’s me out,” said the other mournfully, “for when my pards gets through with you, mister smarty, there won't be anything for me to tackle.”
Buffalo Bill burst into a laugh, and the laugh was followed by these words in his natural voice: “Jack, you’re to be pitied. But Hiclcok has the call, and so I reckon you’ll have to suck your thumbs.”
“Buffalo Bill!” exclaimed the two players at once. “Same party/’ responded the king of scouts, as he stood up and faced the two astonished frontiersmen. “Who won the game?”
“The pot is yours,” said Wild Bill sheepishly.
“Take it,” added Texas Jack. “Your hand was a dizonda.”
The king of scouts, his face all smiles, stepped forward and clasped hands with his old pards. Then all three sat down for an earnest talk.
“I’ll admit you were right in the opinion you have not yet expressed,” began Wild Bill, with a sober countenance. “We certainly were acting like champion idiots when you stole upon us. But there is this excuse. We hadn’t been sitting there more than five minutes, and we intended to quit after the hand had been played. Jack boned me for a game to decide our course of action. If I won, we were to stay here and wait for the owner of that pony there. If Jack won, we were to hike down the canon and keep on hiking until we reached Cheyenne.”
“Whose pony did vou think it was?” asked Buffalo Bill.
“Pawnee Serpent’s. And that’s right, isn't it?”
“No, it’s mine. I bought it of the Serpent three weeks ago.”
“Then the Serpent isn’t in these parts?” said Texas Jack.
“I don’t think so. I left him at Fort Fetterman.” “Too bad,” remarked Wild" Bill. “I wanted to see him. He told me a fine gold-story about two months ago, and promised to meet me near Paradise .Valley either to-day or lo-morrow.” '
“And, therefore, when you came upon the pony he used to ride, you thought he was here?”
“Sure, Cody.”	,	I
“What was the story he told you?”
“He said he had stumbled on a cache of twenty-dollar gold pieces, and that as there was enough for more than one man, he would take me to the place and whack
UP-” .
“Did he say where the gold was hidden r”
“No, but I reckon it’s somewhere in these hills.” “Correct, and I myself am on the way to find that cache.”
“The dickens you say!”
Buffalo Bill told the story of the Illinois bank-robbery and the quest of Herbert Strand.
“Good-by to a golden dream," said T-aas Jnck, as he put on a sorrowful look. “The money must go to this fallow Strand. Well, right i? right, and wrong is sometimes mixed up with tear-burdened regrets. But ^
sha’n't whimper. On the contrary—what do you say? Hickok?”
“Say?” repeated the tall scout promptly, “why, I say we will stay with Bill until he and Strand get what they are after.”
“I am after a young woman, as well as the stolen gold,” said the king of scouts. “The young woman is a prisoner in Paradise Valley, and my first business will be to get her away from Ihere and restore her to her family or friends.”
“Let’s get a move on, then,” said Texas Jack, his handsome face hardening with fierce determination.
“Plenty of time,” replied Buffalo Bill. “Let me give you the lay of the land as I understand it.”
Wild Bill heard what the king of scouts had to say. and instantly proposed that the little party start at once down the canon and clean out the dozen Indians who had been detailed to attack the rocky refuge where Buffalo Bill, Herbert Strand, and the negro were sup' posed to be.
“We can go'up to the trail, and then ride down alongj the route they took when they left old Rushing Water/ he said. “We are bound to sec some of them from oitfv elevated position on the trail.”	,
“Hickok s plan suits me,” rejoined Texas Jack. Then he added: “Strange that we did not see any Indians when we came to this hollow. Must have got here after Rushing Water rode up the ridge. Can’t see the trail from here, you know. We were looking for the Pawnee Serpent, and had come from the middle fork of the Powder through that pass to the northeast, and were riding into this canon when we heard a pony whinny* Leaving our horses, we stole forward on foot, and struck this hollow. Didn’t hear any shooting. Too far away, and too many turns in the canon, I reckon. Now we can get our broncos inside of five minutes, and then away we can go.”
Buffalo Bill, after thoughtfully considering Wild Bill’s proposal, concluded to adopt it. If the Indians down the canon could be disposed of, the campaign against the force of savages in Paradise Valley could be carried forward with a better chance of success.
“I will go back to* where I left Strand and Ham,” hf said to his old pards, “and let them know what we havfc* determined upon. It may be good policy to leave them where they are. If any of the Indians retreat up the canon, Strand and Ham will be in position to take care of them.”
He was gone half an hour, and when he returned he was in excellent humor.
“That negro has the eves of a hawk,” he said. “He has located the Indians, and that fact will help us out greatly.”
In a short time the three scouts were riding down the frail.
Buffalo Bill, without pointing, told Wild Bill and Texas Jack where the Indians were concealed.
The place was in the rockiest part of the canon, and about half a mile from the late hiding-place of Strand and the negro.
To reach it a circuit had to be made, for there no thoroughfare from the ridge.
“The reds must see us.” remarked Wild Bill. “I 'v0ll‘ (Ur what they are up to?”
It is my opinion,” replied Texas Jack., “that think we are Buffalo Bill, Herbert Strand, and
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
Hampton. They are after three men, and here are the three. What’s the matter now?*’ he concluded suddenly.
The Indians had arisen, and were running for their ponies.
The ponies had been out of sight a minute before, but they could now be seen in an open space, and in a state of excitement.
Buffalo Bill saw that an attempt had been made to stampede them.
Who had done this? Not Strand, not Ham, for they could not have got to the rear of the savages in the short time that had elapsed since the king of scouts had left them. Besides, neither the young man nor the negro would be likely to go contrary to the instructions that had been given them.
But Buffalo Bill had no time to solve the puzzle.
The Indians were mounting1, and one, with a recklessness that filled the three scouts with amaze, was riding swiftly toward them.
As the savage rode he waved his hand, and this action prevented Wild Bill from pressing the trigger of his ^rifle.
At the foot of the sharp slope, and directly under them, ^ne Indian halted.
After looking over his shoulder and observing that the other savages were riding, not toward him, but down the canon, he shouted in English:	»
“Hello, Hickok, how’s tricks?”
“Pawnee Serpent!” ejaculated the tall scout. “Holy Moses, but this beats the Dutch!”
The Serpent, disguised so that he had the appearance of a simon-pure Sioux, laughed, pointed to the retreating Indians, and said:
“They’ll never come back.”
“I reckon we may as well make certain that they won’t,” put in Texas Jack. “Come on, boys, we can overhaul ’em before they strike the main trail.”
“No,” said the Serpent quickly. “Let ’em go. We’ll lose time going after them. Something else to do. We must stop the marriage of the White Queen.”
Buffalo Bill, now alive with interest, asked earnestly: ^ “When is the marriage to take place ?”
• “To-morrow night?”
“And the would-be husband—who is he?”
“Rushing Water. Wait until I can get to you, and I will tell you all about it.”
The scouts remained where they ware until the Pawnee Serpent had made a detour, and reaching the trail, had ridden up to them.
He was a magnificent specimen of his race. He was tall, lithe, and graceful. His prepossessing countenance expressed intelligence, courage, and good nature. Educated at a white school, he could speak English as well as the ordinary plainsman.
He claimed to be half-Sioux, and always found it easy to pass himself off as one. As a government scout he had been of marked assistance to the military officers.
He greeted the three scouts with easy familiarity, and then told his storv.
“When you parted with me, Cody,” he began, “I had no idea that I would be after you within a few hours. I had sold to you my ponv, and I had planned to go over to the Wood Reservation and take my pick of a lot of ponies there.
“I had borrowed a mustang from Captain Haines, and
was about to leave, when in comes the pony-express. There was a letter for me. It was written bv Banker Goodwin, at Cheyenne. I saved Goodwin’s life once— and it asked me to search for a young white woman who had been captured a couple of months ago by the Sioux.
A description of the chief who had been seen in the hills where the young woman had gone on a trip of mercy gave me the clue I needed. The chief was Rushing Water, and I knew that his headquarters had lately been fixed at Paradise Valley.
“The colonel, to whom 1 showed the letter, wanted to send soldiers with me, but I objected. I had to first locate the prisoner, ascertain how many Indians were guarding her, and what kind of a defense they could make. Having done this preliminary %vork, I would go back to the fort and ask for a detachment of soldiers.”
“Is this man, Goodwin, a relation of the young woman?” asked Wrild Bill.
“No, he is A friend of her father.”
“Go on with your story,” said Buffalo Bill, who was anxious to learn what the Serpent had discovered.
“I did not follow the route you took, Cody,” the Pawnee proceeded. “I know every foot of this country, and I made use of several cut-offs. I reached Paradise Valley two days ago. As a Sioux, from the Tetons I entered the little valley. I had made up for the deception. and I knew I could pass muster, for I knew every Sioux trick, custom, and observance. Rushing Water was away when I arrived, but I was informed that he would return soon, for a date had been fixed for his marriage with the White Oueen, 'as they called the prisoner.
“Did you see her?” questioned Buffalo Bill.
“No. She was confined in the old cabin, and no one was allowed to look upon her face except the chief's brother, Silver Tongue, who has charge of her.
“The chief did not come as soon as was expected, and this morning a detachment was sent out to look him up. I worked it so that I was made a member of it. You know, Cody, what happened. We met the chief, heard of the adventure with a white man and a negro, and soon after had a sample of your capacity as a rifleshot.
“I did not like the position I found myself in, but when myself and eleven others were detailed to get behind the rocky barricade that sheltered you and your friends, I thought I saw a way to be of some service to you.
“The appearance on the trail of yourself and your partners hastened my action. The leader of our party had a spy-glass, taken from the body of a white officer, and at sight of your companions, Cody, he imagined the worst. What did the.presence of the three most famous scouts of the American Army mean?
“He turned to me, and I told him that your presence meant an advance by the soldiers; that it was probable that the soldiers were now in possession of Paradise Valley, and that Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill, and Texa9 Jack had been sent out to locate the detachment Rushing Water had detailed to rout the white man and the negro.
“While he was rounding-up his braves, I slipped away and turned loose the ponies. I would have stampeded them if I had had a little more time. As it was, the Sioux leader saw them come together in a frightened bunch, and at once thought that the work had been
14
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
done by a scout of the enemy. He never suspected me until he saw me about to ride away, and I quickly disarmed his suspicions by telling him that I was going to surrender, and that my act would give him and his braves time to make good their escape.
“It has come out as I predicted, and the Indians will not stop until they have reached the big camp of the Sioux, in the Rattlesnake Hills, and that place is more than fifty miles away/’
“It is probable that you are right, Serpent,” was the comment of the king of scouts, “but we must make sure that the Indians are really making lightning time for Rattlesnake before we turn and ride to Paradise Valley.
“I’ll soon settle that point,” said Texas Jack. “I have a rat-biter that is a world-beater for speed, and it won’t take me long to find out what you want to know, Cody.” He was off like a shot, and the two scouts and the Pawnee waited on the trail until he returned.
He was gone an hour.
“It’s all right,” he announced as he brought his pony to a standstill before his friends. “The reds are making the dust fly. When I last saw them they were galloping through the lower pass as if the devil and all his imps were at their heels.”
“Good,” said Buffalo Bill. “Now we can arrange for our campaign against the savages in Paradise Valley. We will ride to the place where Strand and Ham are concealed, and there do our planning.”
It was now afternoon, and the scouts found the young man and the negro in a state of great excitement.
“We saw tfie Indians scatter without the firing of a shot, saw one of the band ride up in a friendly manner to you and your friends, Mr. Cod)',” said Strand; “and we were amazed, Tor we could not guess the situation. W’ell,” looking atf the four scouts, “we are fixed now, are we not?”
“You bet,” said Wild Bill. “If we can’t take Paradise Valley, I’m a liar by the watch!”
Buffalo Bill’s face was sober.
“We will have to do some responsible slick work before we can make good in that hole,” he said. “And there is one thing that must be done right away. Rushing Water will expect the return of the dozen Indians he sent out.”
“When?” asked Strand.
“By midnight to-night, at latest. If they do not return by that time, the chief will suspect that the affair has gone wrong, and he will send out scouts to ascertain what has detained his braves. It is a three-hours’ ride to the valley. If one of us should start now, he could reach the entrance to the place before dark.”
The king of scouts looked at the Pawnee as he ceased speaking.
“I see what you are driving at,” said the Serpent. “You want me to ride to the valley and tell Rushing Water a tale that will explain the absence of the braves who set out with me to kill or capture Mr. Strand and his companion. I’ll do it, but it’s risky.”
“It sure is,” remarked Texas Jack. “If the Serpent was an old member of the band, his wprd might go for gospel truth. But being, as he is, a newcomer, his statement might seem fishy. The chief is no fool, to be hoodwinked by some old'woman’s yarn. He's as'shrewd as they make ’em, ana if I were you, Cody, I would
think up some other wav of pulling the wool over Rushing Water’s optics.”
Buffalo Bill nodded.
“I reckon you’re right, Jack. The move would be risky. It might spoil our little game. Let me think again.” He puckered his brows, and for a time there was silence.
' Ham Hampton spoke while the king of scouts was in the midst of perplexing cogitations.
“I cfone berleeb I’se got de boss idee, Misto Cody,” he said. '“If dis Misto Serpen’, goes a-meanderin’ alone inter dat Injun hole, he sho’ goinJ ter hab de time ob his life er-gitten out wid a whol’ skin. But”—he paused, narrowed his twinkling eyes, and fixed them on Buffalo Bill—“dar’s a way ter reenfo’ce his position. Yo’ lieah me, dar is. If he teks a pris’ner along wid him, lie’ll den be perpared ter wuk de game easy.”
“What do you mean?” asked Buffalo Bill quickly.
“I means, Misto Cody, ter perpose dat de Serpen’ tek me along wid him.”	/
CHAPTER V.	<■
BUFFALO BILL'S DESPERATE VENTURE.
The proposition of Ham Hampton caused general surprise. Soon surprise gave way to admiration. The four scouts and Herbert Strand looked at the stalwart negr0 with sparkling eyes.
Wild Bill was the first to speak.
“By the jumping Jew’s-harp I” he exclaimed, “but you are a daisy, Haiii. You’re strictly all right, but it won’t do; it won’t do, my friend. We are not going to make this campaign by feeding you to that murdering old chief as a starter. Not much, we ain’t!”
“Shucks!” was the contemptuous retort. “I sho’ knows what I done talkin’ about. De Serpen’ teks me dar a. pris’ner, an’ he say to de chi§?.» ‘Hyer’s one ob dem. One got kilt, an’ de udder, Buffalo Billium, gottcr away, an? de eleben brabes are sho’ chasin’ him. Dey don’ ’spec dat dey*ll be able ter git back to de valley afo’ noon terv morrer, case de white man done cotch a hawse, an’ am ridin’ down de kenyum like de win’/ ”
“That’s good, as far as it goes, Ham,” said Buffalo Bill; “but where do^ou get off?”
“I sho’ gets off on mah feet, Misto Cody,” replied the negro, with a grin of satisfaction. “Don’ yo’ see? Ole Rushin’ Watali he put me in de prison-house, ter keep twel de udder Injuns git back wid Misto Billium, or his skelp. I ain’ in danger fer a long time. An’ afo’'^e Injuns kin start in wid dem monkey-games, yo’ll sho be some’r’s aroun’ ter hab a say-so. Dat’s right; I knows it is.”
The king of scouts did not immediately reply.
When he did speak it .was with gravity.
“On further consideration, boys,” he said, “this proposal of Ham’s strikes me as worthy of adoption. Going into the Indian camp as prisoner, he is safe from immediate death. We have got to make some move to rescue the white woman, and the move must he made pretty pronto. If it were not for her desperate situation, I would not be willing to accept Ham's generous, self-sacrificing offer. Rushing Water’s anxiety about his braves mu^t be allayed. I didn’t see any other
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
way of doing the trick than by permitting Serpent to take Ham along with him.”
“There can be a slight alteration of the same way,” spoke Herbert Strand, with decision. “Let me go, instead of Ham.”
“No, that will not do/’, returned Buffalo Bill firmly. “You are not in condition for a quick trip to the valley. You must go with us, and we will proceed slowly. Han't is the man for the venture. He is as strong as a bull, and, at a pinch, can make a better showing than you would be able to make."
Strand protested, but his words had no effect.
After the plans had been fully arranged, the Pawnee and the negro rode off. Ham was not bound, the understanding being that he should not assume the role of a prisoner until within a few miles of the valley.
A couple of hours after the departure of the Pawnee and Strand’s servant, the three scouts and the young man from Illinois set out for the valley. They had not gone far before Buffalo Bill’s face showed uneasiness.
“Boys,” he said, “I am afraid that I have let Ham and the Serpent into a nasty game. When I consented to |Ham's offer I did not give sufficient thought to Wall-eyed Hoskins, Quicksand Quick, and Buck Swinny. The three of them are with the Sioux in Paradise Valley. The Pawnee met Quick and Swinny on the trail—-they were with Rushing Water, you know—and as he did not mention them, the presumption is that either he did not know them, or they did not know him.
“Now, I am not satisfied about the knowledge of these three scoundrels. Quick has b?en all over the Rocky Mountain country, and it would be strange if he had not somewhere met the Pawnee. He might not have paid any attention to the Pawnee when the detachments of Sioux met 011 the trail, but in the valley he would have opportunity to look closely at the Indian who brought in the prisoner. If lie should recognize the Serpent, he would understand atonce that a trick was being played, and it would be all up with our friends.” , “From what you told me, Cody, I would suppose that Quicksand Quick would be in disfavor. Ten to one, he l Is a prisoner, and won’t have the chance of seeing the • Pawnee,” said Texas Jack.
“If he doesn’t, Wall-eyed Hoskins will. But I don't think Quick is a prisoner. He released Strand, who was Rushing Water’s, prisoner, and made off with him. Rushing Water found Quick bound hand and foot. What story would the rascal be most likely to tell ? Why, that he had seen Strand steal away from the Indian camp, had followed, for the purpose of catching him, and had been attacked by the negro. Rushing Water would believe him, for the evidence would be in the rascal’s favor.”	*
“You’ve hit it, Cody,” said Wild Bill. “Quick has saved his bacon, sure shot!”
The subject was not discussed further.
When night fell, the party were at the base of a precipice along one side of which the trail zigzagged in perilous ways.
Buffalo Bill here called a halt.
“At the top of this wall,” he explained, “the trail turns around a big boulder. On the other side of the turn is the place of all places for a sentinel. There must be one there, and, therefore, it would be folly for us to go
up there with our ponies. We must leave them in this vicinity—in that clump of trees beyond the waterfall— and make the rest of the journey on foot. We have not far to go to reach the valley.”
“What if the sentinel is on this side of the turn ?” said Wild Bill. “That’s where he ought to be, and if he is there, he’ll see 11s as we climb up.”
"Your head is. level, Hickok,” spoke the king of scouts. “But,” he added, “'we’ve got to pass him.”
He looked at the face of the precipice with a frown on his face.
“Think you can beat that wall?” asked Texas Jack. . “If it were daylight, I’d try to do it,” was the grim response.
“Near the middle, and about half-way up, there is a tree,” said WTild Bill.
“And above the tree there is an irregular cut extending to the top,” added Herbert Strand.
Buffalo Bill’s eyes flashed.
“I’ll make it,” he said, with determination. “I’ve got to.”
Wild Bill laughed softly. “Where are your wings. Cody? You’ll have to fly to reach that tree.”
The distance from the basje of the wall to the tree was about thirty feet, and the wall itself was almost vertical. and was without indentation. Smooth and sheer, it seemed to mock the wish of the onlooker.
Buffalo Bill took two reatas, knotted them together, and then made a series of loops.
Standing off at the proper distance, he swung the lasso above his head, and, having obtained the necessary momentum, shot the loop upward. The rope struck the tree, stayed there a moment, then dropped down.
The scout had aimed at the stump of a limb a few feet from the end of the trunk.
“Pretty close, Cody,” said Texas Jack. “Try it again.”
“Try it again?” snorted the king of scouts. “I’ll try it forty times before I’ll give up I”
The third time won. The reata looped about the limb, and was drawn tight by Buffalo Bill. As there -was the possibility that the limb might be rotten, he tested the rope thoroughly before beginning his ascent. v “It’s all right,” he announced. “Now for it.”
“What must we do?” queried Wild Bill. “Suck our thumbs until you call out to us ?”
“You might finish that poker-game I interrupted a while ago,” was the smiling reply.
“Go chase yourself!” responded Wild Bill testily.
“I know what I’ll do,” put in Texas Jack. “If you are not up to the top, master of the situation, inside of half an hour, I’ll run up the trail to see what is detaining you.”
“I agree to that. So long!”
Up the rope went the king of scouts. His friends watched him until they saw him disappear over the summit.
Wild Bill vented his opinion of his old partner's venture.
“Cody is a chain-lightning wheeler, all right, and FU back him against the best man that ever walked On two legs. All the same, boys, he’s a bit reckless.”	■**
i6
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
“And that’s where he differs from you, eh?” said Texas Jack, with a broad grin. “You’re never reckless. Caution, discretion, slowness, and consideration are written in large letters on your seven-by-nine fizzymahogany, Hickok. Certainly you’ve a right to preach on the folly of jumping before you look”
Wild Bill smiled. -	*
“I reckon your hand’s good, Jack, but what you say doesn’t cool my interest ..in Buffalo Bill’s break. He thinks there will be smooth sailing for Him up at the big'boulder, and he aims to play a lone hand. I don’t blame him, but still, I am worried about him. Like as not there’s a mob of reds up there. I’m not going to stay here and play dummy. You can do as you please about following,” he went on, “but my advice is to crawl up the trail and lend a hand from that direction, in case a hand is needed.”
“All right, Hickok. Go ahead. I reckon you’re no slouch, if you do have fits occasionally.”
Wild Bill went up the rope to. the tree, and then made his way quickly along the crevasse to the top of the wall.
As soon as he was out of sight, Texas Jack and Herbert Strand took the zigzag trail on the side of the precipice.
The darkness favored them for over half the journey.'
A series of pistol-shots from the direction of the big boulder at the top startled Strand, and brought a savage expression into the face of Texas Jack.
“There’s the devil to pay!” he said. “Stay here, and I’ll go up and take a hand.”	1
Up the incline he went with the agility of a mountain-sheep.
Herbert Strand followed as fast as he could. The shots continued, and commingled with the reports were heard the fierce yells of savages.
At the summit of the wall there was sufficient light for the well-nigh exhausted young man from Illinois to take in the details of the stirring scene that was being enacted.
Buffalo Bill, stealing toward the boulder which he expected to be defended by a single Indian, had run into a nest of Sioux. They formed a detachment sent out after dark by Rushing Water to meet the eleven braves who had been ordered to surround and capture or kill Buffalo Bill, Herbert Strand, and Ham Hampton.
The scheme of deception conceived by the Pawnee Serpent had failed. The fears of the king of scouts had been realized. The Serpent, arriving at the Indian encampment in Paradise Valley, had been met by Rushing Water, Quicksand Quick, and Wall-eyed Hoskins. It was Hoskins who recognized the Pawnee and
i
denounced him.
The plucky spy had just finished his made-up story, and was hoping that it would be accepted as the truth,
when Hoskins spoke, and dashed his hope to the ground. A fierce struggle ensued, for the Pawnee did not passively submit to capture.
After he and the negro had been taken to a teepee and placed under a heavy guard, Rushing Water sent out twenty Sioux to look up the missing eleven.
The king of scouts saw but one Indian as he crept to the rear of the big boulder and peered around it.
The savage was sitting down, with his back to the rock. Bejow, and out of sight from the scout, were the Indians from the valley. They had arrived but a few minutes before, and were now resting. Rushing Water had instructed them to remain an hour at the boulder, so as to prevent a possible descent to the valley of Buffalo Bill and his friends.
The Pawnee Serpent had refused, after his arrest, to say what had become of the eleven Indians, and Rushing . Water feared that they had met with a serious mishap.
It was the chief’s opinion, if the two white men had succeeded in defeating the eleven braves, that ther' would attempt to enter the valley.
If he should permit them to do so, and they should come by the trail, there was the danger that they might be able to inflict severe punishment upon the force of Sioux holding the valley. Buffalo Bill was looked upons j as being worth a score of ordinary white men, and Rushing Water’s fear of the famous scout and Indian-fighter was so great that he resolved to take every precaution^ against a surprise. After the departure of the detachment, he stationed braves at various points on the trail leading out of the' little valley, and then sought teepee, to sleep with one. eye open.
Buffalo Bill mounted the big boulder and then, before the sentinel ^oukKturn his head, leaped upon the savage and crushed him to the ground.
The daring act was performed in full view, of the rest-/ ing Indians.	^
They were on their feet instantly, and two score of tomahawks came out.
If no noise had followed their rising, Buffalo Bill would probably have been brained before the lapse of a dozen seconds.
But the savages could not restrain their fierce satisfaction at having at their mercy the white man who was dreaded by them above all others. They let out wild yells as they advanced, and this announcement of their presence gave the king of scouts a chance for his life. \
He.was choking the sentinel into submission when the yells reached his ears. Like a flash, he rolled over, flattened himself behind the body of the sentinel, and fired a shot from1 his revolver just a9\a couple of tomahawks clove the air within an inch of his head.
At the same moment, and while the advance was temporarily checked, Wild Bill came upon the scene.
With a shout of encouragement;, he sprang into view

from behind the boulder, and the pop, pop, pop! of his pistols sent consternation into the ranks of’the redskins.
A few of them bad the courage to advance arid return the shots, but the others retreated to the shelter of a roek, and from that position fired at random.
Buffalo Bill did not rise to his feet until he saw that his own and Wild Bill's pistol-work had cleared the view of redskins. The brave who had made the stand had fallen to rise 110 more. Now the king of scouts arose, grasped Wild Bill's hand, and after indicating with a nod the hiding-place of the savages who had retreated, moved off the trail with the intention of getting in the rear of the enemy.
Wild Bill withdrew to the shelter of a niche between the big boulder and the bank, and waited for his partner to reopen the ball.
A shot, a scream, and the reappearance of the Indians the trail announced that Buffalo Bill’s plan to drive the redskins out of their hole had succeeded. fjJJJjaid now the firing became general, and while it was ^progress Texas Jack appeared to take a hand.
With a yell that sent terror to the breasts of the Sioux, he dashed around the boulder and, regardless of risk, made for the huddled group of Sioux, his revolver spitting death as he went.
Wild Bill quickly followed his example, and the pistol-play presently was succeeded by a resort to knives and & hand-to-hand conflict.
In the fierce, determined struggle that took place, Buffalo Bill was like a whirlwind in action.	^
A witness to this scene, Herbert Strand stood for a i foment undecided how to actr
But when he saw a savage who had been sent to earth by a blow from a clubbed revolver in the hands of Texas , Jack raise himself on an elbow and take deliberate aim (f^he head of Buffalo Bill, he uttered a shout of warn-and followed it by a shot that found lodgment in the brain of the murderous savage, whose pistol exploded as he fell back upon the ground.
Buffalo Bill felt the wind of the bullet as it flew past his head, and realized that he owed his life to Herbert Strand.
The fight was soon over.
Six of the Indians had escaped, and were now fleeing • down the trail to Paradise Valley. Fourteen lay dead on the scene of the fight.
■ Slight wounds had been received by each of the three scouts, and after proper attention had been given to them, Buffalo Bill said:
, “We* must leave the trail and try to enter the Indian camp at some point where our presence will not be suspected. I know this section pretty well, and I believe I can find a safe way to the valley.”
“We have one advantage,” said Texas Jack. "The reds can’t trail us while the night lasts.”
“I don’t think they will try to,” returned Wild Bill dryly. "The little reception we dished out to them won’t make Rushing Water anxious to dp any investigating up this way until daylight comes."
“A dollar to an enchilada that you’re right, Bill,” said Cody quickly. “Why not chance it? We can save lots of valuable time.”
“Do you mean now that going down the regular trail is the proper caper?” questioned Texas Jack.
“Yes. The Indians who escaped will go straight to Rushing Water, and I don’t think he’ll do a thing tonight but have the lower end of the trail, the point where it enters the valley, well guarded. I propose that we go down the trail, approach within a safe distance of the guards, and then figure out some way of getting around them. If we could only get to the log cabin, rescue the White Queen, and snake her away without rousing the Indians, I would be satisfied.” He paused a moment, and then continued, as he slapped his thigh: “By George, boys! I had forgotten something. The tree where Strand's gold is concealed is not far from the log cabin. It is up the trail at a bend, and it may be that Rushing Water’s guards will be placed below it, and that we can come upon it without being seen by any of them.”
“I ishould like to recover the money,” spoke Strand; “but let us pay attention to the young woman first.” “That’s sure the program,” replied Buffalo Bill. “But if we can kill two birds with one stone, so much the better,”
No more was said. Down the trail went the four friends, to arrive within sight' of the treasure-tree about an hour before daylight.
“Now is the time to begin to do the caution act,” said the king of scouts. “One of us must steal forward and get the layout about that tree. If I am not out of my reckoning, the cabin can be seen from the tree. In. a little while it will be light enough to spy out the surroundings below us.”
“I’m the boy for the scout,” responded Wild Bill quickly. “I’m * the lightweight of this aggregation, and-”
\ “A quick mover from Quickville,” interrupted Buffalo Bill. “All right, Hickok, go ahead. Don’t be long, for you know how anxious we ll be if you are not back in half an hour.”
Wild Bill glided away, and in a short time was close to the tree.
The trail was brush-borderjed, and he exercised due caution in approaching the gold-laden sycamore.
He was looking at it intently, when, to his surprise, the form of a white man appeared beside the trunk. The man saw that there was a deep hole in the angle formed by the intersection of the largest limb with the trunk, and a deep sigh of satisfaction escaped his lips.
18	THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
This angle, or crotch, was about four feet from the ground, and the hole’s mouth was covered with leaves and dead twigs.
Inserting his right hand, the man felt about until his fingers touched something that elicited a low ejaculation.
Wild Bill left ,the brush where he had been concealed when the man began to feel about in the crotch. He knew the man, and he* guessed the object of the night visit to the tree.
The man was Wall-eyed Hoskins, and he had come surreptitiously to the tree for the purpose of assuring himself that the gold was still there.
Hoskins was about to turn and leave the spot when fingers of steel closed about his windpipe, and he was borne to the ground and choked into insensibility.
The operation had been performed almost without sound, and after the villain had been gaged and bound, the tall scout lifted the body and staggered with it up the trail.
Before leaving the tree, he had taken in its surroundings. It was around a bend, and the Indian guard, if there was one, was- below at the entrance to the valley. The log cabin, which stood on rising ground at the lower end of the valley, was at some distance from the main traveled path through the Indian camp, and Wild Bill saw it before he reached the tree.
The tall scout’s reappearance with his human burden surprised and gratified Buffalo Bill.
His gratification was increased after he had heard Wild Bill’s story. The gold was within reach, and the only outsider who knew of its location was now a prisoner.
But presently his face clouded.
“If we could have an hour more of darkness,” he said, “there would be something doing. As it is, we’ll do what we can, and trust to luck and main strength and contrariness.”
A slight stir on the trail above the white men made the king of scouts prick up his ears.
Texas Jack, whose face was toward the direction of the noise, saw a head, and quick as a flash his revolver was out. A scream followed the report, and Jack, hurrying up the trail, stopped in front of a fatally wounded Indian.
Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill, and Herbert Strand quickly placed themselves beside their comrade.
"There may be more Indians about,” said the king of scouts, his eyes up the trail.
"No,” spoke the wounded savage faintly, “no more Sioux. Me come all alone.”
“Come from where?” asked Buffalo Bill.
“From canon. Me and ten braves run away from Buffalo Bill and his brothers. Other braves keep on running. Storm Wave turn back, think Buffalo Bill heap fool us.”
“You were riglit, old man,” said Texas Jack. “Cody did play you all for fools.”
“Me know Buffalo Bill long time,” the Indian went on, his breath growing fainter with each word. “Once Storm Wave friend of white soldier. No like white soldier ways. Go back to Sioux.”
In a fe{v moments he was dead.
“Yes,” explained the king of scouts, “this Storm Wave used to be a scout for Uncle Sam. I was with him on several campaigns. What a big fellow he is! About my height and build. Nose more like that of a white man than that of an Indian. Forehead retreats, but when that head-dress is pulled forward, you don’t see much of the head above the eyebrows. Say, boys, I’ve got it. I'm going to take this dead redskin’s duds, fix my face, and walk into the valley as Storm Wave.”
“What can you do when you get there?” asked Texas Jack.
“Make it .easier for the rest of this gang to save the young white woman and corral that gold.”	f ^
“Your disguise, be it ever so good, will be penetra&c/ said Wild Bill. “If the venture was to be made in the night, you might pull it off successfully. But you'll run your snoot into a hornets’ nest if you mosey down there in daylight. And that’s whatever.” The speaker looked at Texas Jack, and caught a nod of acquiescence.
Buffalo Bill shook his head smilingly.
“You haven’t caught on to what I intend to do, boys* I know all about Storm Wave, I am up in the Sion* lingo and manner of doing business, and I’ll fix the disguise part so that I will not be suspected. There ha5 been fighting, hasn’t there? Well, in a fight wounds are received, are they not? Admitted, eh? Well, Ston* Wave was wounded, wounded in the face. There’s blood enough right here at my feet to give countenance to what else appears. I’ll tie up my face with Stpf'*j Wave’s bandanna. See ?”	\ J
The two scouts and Herbert Strand saw, and n° further objection to the plan was made.
After Buffalo Bill had stripped the dead foe and Put on the head-dress and the other habiliments, and had fixed his face with paint, blood, and bandanna, he looked the wounded Sioux to the life.
Before leaving his friends to set out on his desperate venture, he issued his instructions.
The two scouts and Herbert Strand were to curry Wall-eyed Hoskins to a point near the treasure-tree, a.vi-there find a hiding-place.
“The story I will tell Rushing Water,” said he, “\vi% I hope, prevent the departure of a single Indian froa*1 the valley. You will probably have to stay all day concealment. Night is the time fixed for the marriage of Rushing Water and the White Queen. Before nig^ I will come to you with my plan for rescuing the gi^* I’ll have all day to develop it.”

As he walked away, Wild Bill and Texas Jack shook their heads.
“He may make the scheme work, Hickok ” said Jack, “but I’m a trifle dubious. He is taking big chances/'’ "That’s right, Jack, but lie has taken them before, and come off winner. Let us hope that he will make good this clatter.”
CHAPTER VI.
DOWN THE PIT OF HORROR.
Buffalo Bill moved away from his friends with a confident step. Day was breaking, and the scene that was unfolded to his view as he descended the trail was one of beauty and peace. All was still in the valley, and there was nothing to indicate that the air of the little place was surcharged with war.
tie paused at the tree which held the gold, and won-*v^d how it was possible to remove the treasure without driving the Indians from the, valley. The gold would weigh at least two hundred and fifty pounds, and to transport- such a weight a packhorse would be required.
‘T must wait on events/’ he said to himself. “No use in borrowing trouble.”
Turning the bend, he came in sight of the Indians placed as guard at the entrance to the valley. There were( a dozen of * them.' Some were squatted on the ground smoking, others were lying down, and were evidently asleep.
The disguised scout walked boldly toward the savages. He was seen, and low exclamations from the smokers reached his ears. Not pne of them arose as he approached. They gazed at him curiously, and waited for to speak,
in a few words, spoken in Sioux, he informed them that he had been in a fight with the dreaded white scout and his companions, and that the whites were now flee-ingj with his fellow braves in hot pursuit.
To one who seemed to be the leader,1 he said:
‘Take me to Rushing Water, the great chief who plans wisely and whose fame is second only to that of his renowned cousin, Rain-in-the-face.”
The Indian addressed arose and guided the false Storm Wave to the teepee of Rushing Water.
Leaving Buffalo Bill at the door, the Indian entered. T he chief was awaket and heard without comment the news of the arrival of Storm Wave.
The.guard came out and motioned for Buffalo Bill to enter.	,
The disguised scout was- glad that the light within the teepee was dim. He believed he would be able to carry out his scheme of deception, but the more favorable the conditions, the better would he be satisfied.
His long acquaintanceship with Storm Wave enabled him to imitate the rasping tones of that dead warrior. After the usual respectful greeting, he said:
“Storm Wave is sorry that he does not come with the scalp of Buffalo Bill, but the other braves of Rushing Water are on the trail of the great white scout, and they will capture him, for he is on foot, and has lost his rifle.”
“The braves Rushing Water sent out to overcome the white devil and his friends were betrayed. There was a Pawnee spy in the band,” said the chief coldly.
Buffalo Bill lowered his head shamefacedly. “Storm Wave was deceived. His brothers were deceived, and” _ —raising his head—“even the illustrious chief was deceived.”
Rushing Water frowned.
“The spy came here,” he replied harshly4 “and he did not come alone.”
The disguised scout assumed an expression of astonishment. “How does Rushing Water know this?” he asked, “Can he see over the mountains?”
“lie has seen and he has acted,” was the savage response.
“Then the spy and the black man have been captured ?”
The chief nodded. “Now,” he said gruffly, “tell your story.”
The story was ready. ■'It was to the effect that Buffalo Bill’s companion had been killed, and that the scout himself was wounded, and would be dead or a prisoner before nightfall. Three braves had been slain —this statement was made for the purpose of giving a reasonable air to his yarn—and the braves hunting Buffalo Bill had so distributed themselves that it was impossible for the dreaded enemy to escape.
“And if he should,” was Rushing Waters unspoken thought, “he will not come back here. Alone and wounded, lie will make his way to Fort Fetterman, and if the soldiers come to the valley, a week must elapse before they can reach here. And a week will find Rushing Water and his braves many leagues away.”
It was therefore with a composed face that he bade the false Storm. Wave to seek the rest he so much’ needed.	^
Buffalo Bill was about to leave the teepee when RusH* ing Water continued: “The prisoners are in your teepee. I will not disturb them. Remain here. Occupy the couch of Rushing Water until night comes.”
This order was not altogether to the liking of the king of scouts, but he had the wisdom to make no protest.
The chief went out, and it was a long time before he returned.
t
During his absence something happened that had a sinister relation to the fortunes of the false Storm Wave.
20
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
While Buffalo Bill was solacing his stomach with jerked beef taken from his wallet, Rushing Water was holding a most interesting conversation with a young Indian who had just arrived in the camp.
He had not come by the hill trail which had brought Buffalo Bill to the valley, but had taken a route which had permitted him to reach the camp from one side of the valley.
The reason for making this roundabout and arduous journey was explained in the startling story he poured into the chiefs ears.
He, like Storm Wave, was a member of the detachment detailed to look out for Buffalo Bill and his companions. He had seen Storm-Wave leave the detachment, and guessing what was in Storm Wave’s mind, had determined to follow him.
He did not ride boldly after his fellow brave., for he feared that Storm Wave might resent what might be considered an interference with an important plan. Storm Wave was a big, powerful Indian, while Sharp Knife, the narrator, was a lightweight.
So he played the role of shadower, and was a witness to the scene that resulted in the death of Storm Wave at the hands of Texas Jack.
He had seen the forms of Jack’s companions, and though the night was still on, he got near enough to recognize them as Buffalo Bill, liis formidable, partner, Wild Bill, and the young tenderfoot who had come into the Sioux country with the negro.
Lying in concealment, he had overheard the talk in English, which he could not understand, and had seen Buffalo Bill disguise himself as Storm Wave and depart on his errand of deception.
Then it was that he left the trail, and by hard climbing managed to reach the Indian camp from one side of the valley.
Rushing Water listened, and fear soon gave way to fiendish exultation.
Buffalo Bill was in his power, and Wild Bill, Texas Jack, and the white tenderfoot were in a pocket, for braves could easily get in their rear without discovery, and thus render their extermination certain.
After cautioning Sharp Knife to hold his tongue in regard to what he had discovered, Rushing Water went to the log cabin and had a long talk with his brother, who had been selected to guard the Wrhite Queen.
At the conclusion of the conversation the chief walked to Ms teepee. There is little humor in the average Indian, but Rushing Water possessed more than his share. The situation caused him to smile, and he resolved to play a while with his victim. The part would require good acting, but the chief believed he could fill the bill.
Entering the teepee, he said cordially: “Rushing Water no longer fears the white enemy. He will not leave the camp for many days. To-night the great celebration
will take place. When the White Oueen has been made the wife of Rushing Water, the braves may dance, and the fire-water may be passed around.”
Having said this, the chief actually grinned at the false Storm Wave.
Buffalo Bill had seen few grinning savages. He was not deceived. Something had occurred to make Rushing Water act in this strange manner.
The scout tried to puzzle the matter out, but could not. He replied to Rushing Water in these words:
“The White Queen should be proud to become the wife of the great warrior of the Sioux,”
The chief nodded smilingly.
“Rushing Water will have reason to be satisfied with the night’s work if the braves who are hunting Buffalo Bill shall return with him as a prisoner. Rushing Water would be willing to forego his marriage with the White Queen if he could have the pleasure of introducing Buffalo Bill to the Pit of Horror,”
The Pit of Horror! The disguised king of sco^.f ' shuddered. He had not thought of the awful sink wlife^-made the name of the valley that held it a ghastly mockery. Paradise Valley! Rather should the place be called “The Devil’s Caldron.”
In the middle of the meadows, at the upper end of the valley, was what was believed to be a bottomless hole.
It was about four feet in diameter, and into it flowed a tiny stream of water, fed by the mountain springs.
Attempts to sound it had resulted in failure. Once Buffalo Bill, with triple-stranded reatas, had descended over fifty feet into darkness and emptiness. Far below him he could hear the rumbling of water, but he dared not descend farther. One life had been lost in the unknown depths of the pit. An Indian, crazed with illness, had wandered there one night, and had disappeared.
Buffalo Bill’s voice was hoarse as he responded to >N\ chief’s remark':	\J
Such a death is fitting for the man who has slain so many braves of the great Sioux nation.”
Again the savage grinned. Gloatingly, he fixed h*s eyes on his victim. Buffalo Bill could not repress a shiver.
“Rushing Water has communed with the Great Spirit,” the chief said slowly, “and he has been told that the great warrior will find a grave in the Pit of Horror.”
The chief remained a few minutes longer, and then sought the outer air, to mature his plan of vengeance.
Further consideration of the situation made him resotvc to hasten the death of Buffalo Bill, lhere might be danger in waiting until night, as he had determined at his talk with his brother. ,
After calling together six of his braves, the pick of the camp, he explained the conditions and instructed them to follow a course that would bring them to the rear ^ Wild Bill, Texas Jack, and the young tenderfoot. Quick"

sand Quick and Buck Swinny asked and received permission to accompany the six.
Other orders having reference to the disposition of the force in front of the three white men were given, and then the chief made preparation for the disposal of the king of scouts.	t
He had over an hour in which to carry out his savage design, for it would take all of that time for the Indians to complete their rearward movement.
He called to Silver Tongue, his brother, and the latter, who had been standing in front of the log cabin, came forward, and the two conversed in low tones for some minutes.
Silver Tongue, a tall, stoutly built Sioux, was attired in a manner befitting his position as guardian of the White Queen. He wore no head-dress, but enveloping ins head was a red blanket of the largest size. It completely enveloped his form, and allowed only a part of his face to be seen.
^^jThe white warrior does not suspect,” Rushing Water -irfd to his brother, ‘‘but it is well that he should be guarded while the arrangements for his death are going on. You, Silver Tongue, will remain with him until the braves I shall select are ready to act.”
Silver Tongue nodded, and after Rushing Water had detailed a brave to take Silver Tongue's place at the cabin, he went toward--a group of Indians gathered at the lower end of the camp.
Silver Tongue entered the teepee and saw Buffalo Bill lying on a couch of skins, with his face screened by a robe.
The king of scouts had done some hard thinking while Rushing Water was engaged outside.
At last he had come to the bitter conclusion that his plan, for some unaccountable reason, had failed. Rush-Water knew him for Buffalo Bill, and the allusion to the Pit of Horror had a bloodthirsty significance.
He did not raise his head until Silver Tongue spoke. Looking at the powerfully built Sioux, a desperate plan came into his inind.
It was worth trying, and the presence of the chiefs brother at the time seemed to indicate that the moment of deadly peril was near.
He responded to Silver Tongue’s salutation, and then, arising, asked the Indian for some tobacco.
Silver Tongue was in the act of complying when he was seized by the throat and flung upon the couch of skins.
Quick, harsh measures were necessary, and the king of scouts-used them. The Indian made ineffectual struggles to throw off the weight of his strong, remorseless adversary. Before the lapse of a minute he was dead.
Now it was that Buffalo Bill worked with the celerity horn of utter desperation. Five minutes sufficed to array the dead Indian in the garb of Storm Wave and
give the face the bloody-handkerchief covering and disfigurement.
The body was then rolled up in skins and tied at the neck, waist, and ankles.
The king of scouts had just donned the red blanket that had been worn by Silver Tongue when Rushing Water and three braves entered.
“He is dead,” explained the false Silver Tongue. "He suspected something, and was rising to defend himself when Silver Tongue leaped upon him and choked him to death."
This statement was made in a low, monotonous voice, and if there was a lack of resemblance to the voice of the chiefs brother, Rushing Water failed to notice it. He was staring at the dead form wrapped in. the skins. Buffalo Bill kept his face well covered, and( waited in anxious expectancy for Rushing Water’s order.
It was quickly given.
“Take the body to the pit/’ the chief said, “and cast it down. Rushing Water has lizard it said that Buffalo Bill has nine lives. If he had ninety and nine, they will all be lost when the pit receives his body."
The three braves lifted the heavy remains of the slain savage and bore it out of doors, Rushing Water and the false Silver Tongue following them.
Buffalo Bill hoped that the chief would not speak. He was doubtful about being able to imitate the voice of Silver Tongue. It was guttural, but not as harsh as the ordinary Sioux voice. The name Silver Tongue had been given him on account of his mellow tones.
But, luckily, the chief had nothing to say on the way to the Pit of Horror.
The fearsome spot was screened from view by a clump of spruce. Buffalo Bill afterward blessed those protecting trees.
Arrived at the mouth of the hole, the Indians laid down their burden and waited for Rushing Water’s next order.
The chief stepped to the brink of the pit and looked down. One moment he stood there, and th£n turned away with a shiver. As he did so he caught sight of the false Silver Tongue’s face. There was a stiff breeze blowing, and the king of scouts had, without thinking of consequences, pushed back the blanket covering in order to get a better view* of the horrible hole.
He was brought to a sharp realization of his error when Rushing Water’s eyes met his.
Each moved at the same instant, but Buffalo Bill moved with the greater swiftness and the greater intelligence.
Stooping, he rushed forward, and. catching the chief about the waist, raised the body high in the air. and then, with all hi> stre ngth, flung it forward.
The heavy form of Rushing Water struck one of the braves who was in the act of drawing his revolver, and
F
221
THE ^BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
sent him hurtling against another brave, and all three disappeared from view.
The Pit of Horror had swallowed them.
The remaining Indian stood on the farther side of the pit, stupefied with amazement and terror. Before he could make a movement in defense, a revolver caught him in the forehead, and he staggered back, to be seized in the relentless grasp of Buffalo Bill. Down the death hole he went to join his comrades.
The wild, desperate expression faded from the scout’s face. He sighed heavily.
“That was an awful thing to do,” he said to himself^-“but I just had to do it.”
Walking to the edge of the line of trees, he' looked toward the camp. He saw a group of Indians, with their faces turned toward the trees, and guessed that they were waiting for the return of the chief.	'
What should he do to divert suspicion and gain time?"
Now that he had gained so much, it Sseemed a pity to lose all.
A plan came to him, and he proceeded to carry it out.
With his face again concealed, he left the shelter of the trees and advanced resolutely toward the group of Sioux.
“All is well,” he announced in a hoarse voice, followed by a fit of coughing. “The great white warrior has entered the Pit of Horror. Rushing Water knows that the dead cannot return to life, but he will remain, with his three braves, at the mouth of the pit until he hears the voice of the GreaJ: Spirit telling him that the soul of his enemy has entered everlasting darkness.”
“The chief should not wait,” said one of the group. “There is fighting to be done, and it may begin at once.”
Buffalo Bill, who knew nothing of the plans made for the ambush of his friends, wanted to ask a question, but dared not.
There was a way of obtaining the information he was anxious to possess, and this way promised also to strengthen his position in the camp. .
“Bring hither the negro and the Pawnee,” he said, and his voice was hoarser than ever. “It is Rushing Water’s command. They must follow Buffalo Bill to the land of Never-come-back.”
Had the speaker been other than the chief’s brother, the order might not have been obeyed. There was no opposition, and presently Ham Hampton and the Pawnee Serpent were standing before the disguised king of scouts.
CHAPTER VII.
HOT WORK IN THE VALLEY.
The prisoners’ hands were bound, and then they were ordered to march in the direction of the trees that hid from view the Pit of Horror.
The false Silver Tongue walked behind them, after he informed the Indians that he would require no assistance.
When prisoners and guardian were out of the hearing of the Sioux, Buffalo Bill made the negro jump with astonishment by saying in his natural- voice:
“Well, IJam, how has the world been using you ?” “Buffalo Billium! Well, Ah’ll be dumgasted!”
The Pawnee’s eyes sparkled with admiration.
“You deceived me,” he said. “I took you to be Silver Tongue.”
“Those savages back there were also deceived, and if they’ll only stay deceived a while we may win out.’’
He said no more until all three were behind the trees. Then he spoke quickly and earnestly:
“What is in the wind? Are Wild Bill, Texas Jack, and Strand in any danger?”
“They are,” replied the Pawnee. “I overheard iiy structions given to a lot of braves who have gone to attack our friends from the rear. Rushing Water learned of the true situation of affairs from a Sioux who followed another brave, Storm Wave, to the camp. Storm Wave was killed on the trail.
“Yes, I know. Texas Jack settled him. So he was behind, and piped the killing, did he?”	*
“Yes, and saw you go off made up as Storm Wave.” “When did the Indians who expect to do up my friends leave the valley?”
“Abput three quarters of an hour ago. They have not yet had time to get behind the white men.”
' “Half an hour will put them in the position they are aiming to secure. We have got to do something. 1 hive settled accounts with Rushing Water and three of his braves—they are down there”—pointing to the Pit^’ Horror—“and if I have used my eyes to any purpoW there are not now in the camp more than twenty la" dians.”
“That’s about the figure,” returned the Pawnee.
“Then let’s hurry back. Hold, it won’t do for y°l1 and Ham to come with me. I have it. I’ll go back alone, tell the Sioux that you two have been introduce^ to the pit, and that I can’t induce the chipf to come a\va>* He’s determined .to be absolutely sure that his eneniie:? are gone for good and all. They’ll look glum, and th^ I’ll suggest that the whole shooting-match—the tvve11^ of them—march to the pit and put it to the chief tha he had better get a speedy move on, or he may find self strictly up against it.” <
“I see,” said the Pawnee, “and you want us to cl
i*i the
away in the tall grass of the meadow, and be belnnc* teepees by the time the Indians start for the pit ?”
“That’s the ticket. You have a fine head, Serpent.
(THE BUFFALO' BIIX STORIES.
23
The Pawnee’s eyes twinkled 111 appreciation of the compliment, and he followed the retreating form of the king of scouts with an expression charged with deep affection.
Down to the waiting group of savages went the false Silver Tongue. Halting in front of the group, he coughed violently far more than a minute. This exhibition sufficed to explain the increased hoarseness of bis voice.
He told his story, and there was a general nodding of heads, followed by approving grunts.
Down at the end of the valley were a score of savages. Three were left to giiard the entrance to the camp, and the others joined the braves who had listened to and been deceived by the statement of the disguised king of scouts,
,The band moved away. It would take them about five minutes to reach the pit. Those five minutes must be made the most of, so Buffalo Bill thought, or his calce would be all dough.
4^1e stepped between two of the teepees, and there liiet Ham Hampton and the Pawnee Serpent.
One of the teepees was that of the chief. Inside were weapons in plenty, and Buffalo Bill, after a few hurried sentences, hastened to the interior of the teepee, to quickly return with a supply of rifles and revolvers.
'The three were now well armed.
The king of scouts was distributing the weapons wlnin an exclamation from Ham,caused him to turn and look toward the log cabin.
V Silver Tongue’s substitute at the place was standing in front of the door, in the act of bringing his rifle to his shoulder. He had observed the strange, suspicious action of the false Silver Tongue, and had seen the Pawnee and the negro.
When Buffalo Bill had gone to meet his two allies, the |^rd of the White Queen was inside the cabin. He had ■'cOrhe out while the famous scout's back was turned.
A rifle cracked, and the Indian dropped to the ground. The Pawnee had fired in the nick of time.
The report was followed by yells and shots from the lower end of the valley.
Rushing out into the open, the Icing of scouts became the spectator of a thrilling scene.
Wild Bill, Texas Jack, and Herbert Strand had descended on the three Indians left to defend the entrance to the camp, and a furious fight was in progress.
It was soon ended. All three savages were killed, and the victors advanced toward the king of scouts and his companions.
Buffalo Bill waved his hand, and then whirled and looked toward the clump of spruce.
What he saw made him set his teeth hard.
The Sioux sent on a false errand had stopped a hundred yards1 from the line of trees, and were excitedly Conferring.
The shots near the camp had arrested their journey, ancl the sight of the white force had brought'to their cofn-prehension the ugly fact that they had been deceived.
Suddenly an Indian was seen to leave the group and run like a deer for the trees.
His object was divined. He was going to the pit, to learn what had become of Rushing Water.
Buffalo Bill did not wait for him to shout his alarming discovery.
Turning, he greeted his smiling comrades, and then said rapidly:
“I’ll go over and get the woman, while you boys keep an eye on those redskins.”
“No, let me go,” urged Herbert Strand. “Yo.u are needed here. I’ll bring her out. I've got a tomahawk, and if she’s behind’a locked door, I'll soon cut. it down.”
“AH right,” returned the king of scouts, and Strand hurried away.
The front door was open, and he dashed into the main room, saw a door communicating with the only other room of the cabin, and went quickly toward it. He tried the knob, and found that the door was locked.
Crash against the woodwork went his tomahawk.
A scream from within the room hastened his efforts to gain an entrance to the unknown prisoner.
The screaming continued as he cut and slashed.
“Don’t fear!” he shouted. “I am a friend come to rescue you!”
The screaming ceased, and Strand thought he heard an exclamation of amazement.
The panels were smashed, a hole large enough for him to crawl through was made, and he had inserted his head and shoulders when a cry, half-joy and half-astonishment, left his lips.
Standing in the middle of the room, with hands clasped and a smile upon her face, was a tall, queenly girl of surpassing beauty. ‘‘It’s you, then!” the young man cried. “Thank Heaven I have come!”
For the White Queen of Paradise Valley was Mary Wellington, his sweetheart.
In a moment they were in each other’s arms.
It was no time for explanation.
The peril was not yet over.
“Come,” he said, as his lips left hers, “’we must hurry away from here. All the Indians have not yet been driven from the valley."
Hurriedly getting together her few things, she followed him outside.
Buffalo Bill and his friends were not on the main street of the camp, but could be seen in the shelter of the teepees.
They were waiting for the approach of the savages, who now knew that Rushing Water and the braves who had accompanied him to the Pit of Horror had met with
an awful death at the hands of the false Silver Tongue, wfto was rightly supposed to be the dreaded scout and Indian-fighter, Buffalo Bill.
The king of sccuts saw Herbert Strand and the White Queen, and shouted:
"Keep back—go inside the cabin. The redskins will get you if you try to cross over here!”
The two were even then within range of the bullets of the Indians, and as the words were spoken a rifle cracked, and Mary Wellington fell.
Her eyes were open as Herbert Strand, his face convulsed with anguish, bent over her.
“I am not hurt/’ she said, with a smile. “The bullet passed close to my head, and I dropped for the purpose of fooling the Indians. Take me up and carry me into the cabin.”
Strand did so. More ^hots were fired before the room was reached, but all of them missed the mark.
"It’s .all right/’ Strand shouted from tlie doorway.
“She was playing possum.’’
Buffalo Bill received the news with visible relief. He had taken stock of the queenly young woman, and her death at this juncture would have grieved him greatly.
Acting on instructions given by the king of scouts, the Pawnee left his companion and disappeared .at the rear of one of the teepees.
He had gone out to scout the ground about the entrance to the valley.
It was time for the appearance of the detachment sent out to come upon the rear of Buffalo Bill’s old partners and Herbert Strand.
Around the comer of a teepee Ham Hampton peered, and his announcement that the Indians in the meadow were still standing in a group caused Buffalo Bill to smile.
“They don't know where they are at,” he said. “Their chief is dead, Silver Tongue has disappeared, the bnfves at the valley entrance are playing tag in the happy hunting-grounds, and the camp is occupied by five enemies who are collectively worth five times five Sioux. They are not ready to take the offensive. In my opinion, they are waiting for the six braves and the two renegades, Quicksand Quick and Buck Swinnv, before waltzing into the valley and reopening the ball, flam, keep your eye peeled at that corner. At the first move of the reds, let out a yell, and we’ll come a-running.”
For fifteen minutes there was no Jmovement in any direction.	f
The time was made use of by Wild Bill and Texas Jack. Between them was told the story of the advance upon the Indian guards.
“We had been instructed by you, Cody,” said Wild Bill, “to stay there, near the gold-tree, until you came to us. If we’d followed the instructions, we’d be there now.”
1 was betrayed,’ said Buffalo Bill. “Something happened that I did not count upon.”
“I know,” put in Texas Jack. “A red from over the ridge followed Storm Wave, and, sneaking into the camp, gave the snap away to Rushing Water.”
“We got onto the fact early in the game,” Wild Bill went on. “Some time after you left to play your Storm Wave act, Jack and 1 had a serious confab. It appeared to our limited understanding that there was the possibility that Stornv Wave might not be the only Indian desirous of hiking back to Paradise Valley.
“ *1 might as well make certain on that point,’ says Jack. ‘I’ll sashay up the trail, and try and find out i* any red son of a gun has got Storm Wave’s notions in his head.’ So off he goes, and it was not long before he was back with the disturbing news that an Indian had come down the trail a way, then left it and gone over a rocky hill. ‘lie’s sure side-stepping it to the valley, says Jack. ‘I saw him scrambling over the rocks, btf* he was too far away for a shot.’	v
“Now that slick savage, Cody,” pursued \Vild BiH’ “must have crept along the trail, at)d seen us befo*e Jack went off on his scout. He might have potted ollC of us, but he was too big a coward to take the risk getting a bullet himself. I understood his game righ^ away. He’d got onto your scheme, Cody, and he wa* now making cxpress-time to get to the rear of Rushir*£ Water. Maybe you think we did not do some power fa* cogitating about that time.”	' ,
“Shre we did,” said Texas Jack, as \Vild Bill paused* “\Ve saw that we could not play with any chance of winning unless we. got a look at the enemy’s, hand. UP the bank, not far from where we lay, is a tall pine. Wih*

If old Rushing Water makes any break to put Buffalo Bill in a hole, we’ll have to cast discretion to the wind* and go skipping down to camp and engage in slaughter* “Well,” cut in Wild Bill, “I made a sneak, and g0* up in that tree, and obtained a position that gave me * good view of the Indian camp. I was there a long time» but before I got to the ground again I had seen enough to put me onto‘what Rushing Water aimed to do. saw the spy come into camp, saw him confab with the chief, and saw what followed.

call on you, but it was up to me to find out, if I could, when he intended to shut your wind off. I saw the chief go into his teepee, come out again, and another'ln-dian, wrapped in a blanket, part the flap and go in. Pretty soon three Indians followed the blanket man into the teepee. They were out of sight but a short time, and when they reappeared they were carrying a human burden. ‘That’s poor Cody/ says I to myself, and I was on tiie point of giving a yell, to notify Jack and Strand that the time for action had come, when my eyes became riveted to the form of the blanket man; He made a gesture, not once, but twice. ^ No man, white, red, or black, ever made that gesture in that way except William F. Cody. It was an order for the burden-bea.rers to move on. I have .seen you make it a hundred times, and it was all I could do to keep from shouting with delight. Of course, I saw the game. You had downed the Indian who had sported the blanket—he must be the chief’s right-hand man—and his would be the fate that had been ^ ^ogramed for you.
“As the procession moved toward the line of spruce-trees, I caught onto the devilish plan of Rushing Water. The .victim of his hate was to be thrown into the Pit of Horror. ‘Well,’ thinks I to myself, ‘Cody can work that racket to suit himself, or I don’t know him.’ Satisfied that you were all right for the present, Cody, I slid to the ground and went back to Jack and Strand. ^ Jack heard what I had to tell^ and then he hiked off to the tree. When he came back he said that you had won out, and that he had seen you walk back to the pit with the Pawnee Serpent and Ham Hampton. Well, we waited a while, and as our impatience increased I concluded to take, a squint at the Indians, who were guarding the entrance to the camp. I was sure tickled almost to death when I saw that there were only three of them. ‘Now’s ^r time/ says I to Jack and Strand. ‘Cody needs reinforcements, and we’ve got no call to stay up here any ionger.’ *	^
“So we sailed down 011 the ^guards, and it did not take us long to lay them out. Strand was as active and courageous as one would \yish, and hereafter the man that calls him tenderfoot has got a bone to pick with me.”	^
The negro’s head was protruding beyond the corner of the teepee. Buffalo Bill spoke to him.
“Indians still motionless?”
“Dey haben’t moved, Misto Cod}’, but one ob dem am Pantin' to’d de hill dar.”
The king of sctouts looked in the direction indicated
-
by Ham, and sav the head of an Indian raised above a rock on the hill, a short distance from the cabin..
It was a long-distance shot, but Buffalo Bill took it. The head instantly disappeared, and it was the opinion °f.*Wild Bill that there was one Indian less to contend
with.
“That fellow belonged to the party Quick and Swinny are with,” was Buffalo Bill’s comment. “His companions are probably up the trail waiting for his report. He was scouting, I think, and he had been motioning to the redskins in the meadow.”
The Pawnee returned a few minutes later. He had located Quicksand Quick’s crowd. The Indians and the two renegades were in concealment among the rocks, not more than a quarter of a mile from the cabin.
“I hate to divide our force,” said the king of scouts, “but those fellows ought t6 be routed out while it is daylight.”
He would have spoken further if at that moment Herbert Strand had not shouted from the doorway of the cabin:
“We are coming over there. Miss Wellington”—Buffalo Bill started, then smiled at the name—“insisted on * % landing a hand. She says she is a good shot, and she refuses to stay here while our friends are imperiling their lives on her behalf.”
“All right. Let her step to the door, and when I star.t in shooting, the pair of you make a rush.”
Stepping into the open, the king of scouts quickly raised his rifle and began firing at the group of Indians in the meadow. Texas Jack, Wild Bill, and the Pawnee followed suit.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE GOLD AND THE GIRL.
While the rain of bullets pelted the savages, Ham Hampton ran out and met the White Queen and Strand half-way. Seizing the young woman by the hand, he hurried her out of the zone of danger.
The volley poured into the redskins coming so suddenly and unexpectedly caused wild disorder. Only a few shots were fired in return, and these did no damage.
Soon those who had escaped injury fled to the shelter of the line of trees. Sixteen had stood in the group. But nine remained upon their feet.
“By gum! but that young woman deserves a gold medal for springing that game upon us. It was a winner, all right!”	,
The speaker was Wild Bill, an<^ his eyes sought those of Mary Wellington in honest admiration.
The young woman gave him one of her sweetest smiles. She had, been trembling, but was now composed.
In the presence of these brave and skilful frontiersmen, she experienced a wholesome sense of comfort.
There were no means of egress from the valley from beyond the Pit of Horror. To escape from the valley, the Indians now concealed behind the trees must make for one of the sides, or try to fight their way to the lower end and strike the main trail.
26
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
Buffalo Bill spoke of the situation of the nine Sioux, ’ and said that the Indians would never think of making an attempt to escape by the main trail. “They'll wait for night, if we will let ’em,” he said, “and then, if the outfit in the rocks gives them no help, they’ll try to sneak out on one of the sides.”
“It is my opinion,” remarked Wild Bill, “that the last ten minutes have so changed the situation that it will be safe to divide our force. If we can clean out Quick and his band, the reds behind those trees may go to the Old Nick, for all I’care! Quick and his gang are interfering with our retreat from this valley. Get them out of the way and we can give this hole the everlasting go-by.”
Buffalo Bill acquiesced in his comrade’s view.
“There are six of us not counting Miss Wellington.
I will leave Texas Jack, the Serpent, and Mr. Strand to entertain you, Miss Wellington, and will take Hickok and Ham with me on the trip to the hills.”
No objection was raised. If Texas Jack preferred the strenuous life to a talk with a pretty woman, he made no sign.
The king of scouts led the way to the rear of the teepees. The only way to reach the spot where the Pawnee had seen the six Indians and the two renegades was by taking the main trail for a short distance beyond the tree of treasure.
The two scouts and the negro were close to the bend around which was located the sycamore-tree, when Buffalo Bill, who was in the lead, stopped suddenly and placed his finger to his lip.
He had heard low voices ahead.
Motioning to Wild Bill and Ham to remain where they were, he flattened his body and crawled forward on his hands and knees.
At the turn he stopped, listened a moment, and then cautiously looked around it.
He saw a strange sight. Sitting on the ground, at the foot of the sycamore-tree, were Wall-eyed Hoskins, Quicksand Quick, and Buck Swinny.
In front of them were six buckskin sacks, each filled with something that gave the liveliest satisfaction to the three renegades.
Buffalo Bill guessed what the sacks contained, and when he saw Quicksand Quick take out his knife and make a movement to cut the leather tying of one of the sacks, he guessed further that the three rascals, not daring to attempt to carry off all the gold, had resolved to fill their pockets and then hide in another place the money they could not take away. Their backs were toward him, and Quick would have used his knife if ,a stern, insistent voice had not said:
“Drop that sticker and hold up your hands! There are three of us here, and you are itI”
Pale as death, and with a frightful oath upon his lips, the cornered villain dropped the knife. But neither he nor his partners in evil moved from their positions.
Buffalo Bill repeated his command:
“Throw up your hands!”
A pistol-shot followed the words. It was not fired by either Hoskins, Quick, or Swinny, but by Wild Bill.
The tall scout, looking up the bank, over Buffalo Bill's head, had seen an Indian in the act of taking aim at his comrade.
As the Indian fell the king of scouts backed away from the bend, to ascertain the cause of the shot.
Ham Hampton rushed past him as he was rising to his feet.
“Up there! Come on!” said Wild Bill, pointing; and upon the words he began to climb up the steep bank.
Shots and curses induced the king of scouts to follow the negro. He turned, to see Ham on his feet, each hand grasping the throat of a renegade. The third la£ dead on the ground. The negro was shaking the p&' as a terrier shakes a rat, and though the blood was running down his face, he talked and acted with all his original vigor.
“Ah 11 show yo’ whut it means ter swipe de gol* ot> anudder man, yo’ debbil’s imps!” He knocked their heads together a couple of times, and then flung them with such force to the ground that their breath left their bodies. When it returned, they found themselves tied hand and foot.
The king of scouts had watched the affair without any notion of taking' part. He knew that the giant negro would be able to manage both of the outlaws. Pie saw they were Quick and Swinny. Hoskins was the dead one.
Saying. “Stay here till I return,” he went up tK*:. bank, to see what'had become .of Wild Bill.	\ .
The tall scout was nowhere to be seen, but the spectacle of the dead Indian gave Buffalo Bill an idea.
The Indian had cared nothing about the gold, and had come to the place with Quick and Swinny in a search for Hoskins. The villain had been found where Wild Bill and his comrades had left him, and, urged by Quick and Swinny, had revealed the hiding-place of the gold. The Indian agreed to act as lookout while the outlaws filled their pockets.
According to the reasoning of the king of scouts, Wild Bill had found that the Indian had no companions, and had gone on to learn whether or not thv, other five were in the hiding-place discovered by the Serpent, or ha<* moved to some other spot.
Hurrying forward in the direction of the hiding-P*3^ spoken of by the Pawnee, the king of scouts present} caught sight of Wild Bill gliding along between the roc that covered the hill.
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES
2/
A minute later he stopped, and, looking back, saw Buffalo Bill. He beckoned, and the king of scouts hurried to his side.
“I’ve spotted their hole!” he whispered. “It’s over there, behind that biggest boulder. A head appeared just before I turned to see if you were coining.”
“There are five there, and we are two, Iiickok. We ought to make it.”
“Ffre,” repeated Wild Bill. “How do you figure that out ?”
“Easy enough. You settled one, and there were six to begin with.”
“Six Indians, yes. But you haven't taken into account Quick and Swinny.”
“No, I haven’t taken them into account, because Ham Hampton has attended to their case.” Then he told of the adventure around the bend.
Wild Bill grinned in fierce delight. “Ham is a good one, Cody. Pity he is black.”
S‘He doesn’t need your pity. He is satisfied with his or.”
“Then* I’m not knocking. Was he hurt much?”
“No. Those scoundrels shot at his face, but inflicted only flesh-wounds. He’ll be covered with facial scars when^ he gets out of these woods.”
There was the sound of firing from the valley.
Buffalo Bill turned pale. “The'-young woman, Miss Wellington!” he ejaculated. “The Indians have concluded to make a fight, and I am afraid that she may be in danger.”
Wild Bill paid no heed to these words. His eyes were fixed on something in front of him. v,Look, Cody,” he exclaimed in excitement, “the redskins are leaving the boulders and running toward the valley!”
“They are going to the assistance of the other In-^jjtns,” replied Buffalo Bill. "We’ll see about that.” '“r'He was off with a bound as he spoke, and Wild" Bill sprang after him.
What had occurred in the valley had been brought about by the division of Buffalo Bill’s force. A scout of the Indians concealed behind the line of trees in front 'of the Pit of Horror had seen the king of scouts and two companions leave the teepees for the trail out of the valley, and his report had infused the redskins with course. They were nine in number, and opposed to them were three white men and a woman. If a rush for the c3mp should be made, the Indians on the hill beyond the cabin might be counted on to come* to the assistance their comrades.	,
After hurriedly considering the situation, it was re-s°lved to make the sortie.	*
As they moved out into the open, the force divided, five pursuing their way in a direct line, so as to strike the- road through the camp, the other four making a detour, so as to get to the redr of the teepees.
The Pawnee Serpent, looking out, saw the movement, and understood what it meant.
H| communicated his discovery to his companions, and it was determined that Texas Jack and Strand should watch from the front, and that the Serpent and Mary Wellington—she insisted on being considered—should guard the rear.
The five Indians making for the road were just out 6i rifle-range when they reached a spot a short distance from the beginning of the line of teepees.
There they halted and had a short consultation.
It ended in a movement that made Texas Jack whistle. The quintet disappeared behind the line.
“I understand what the scheme is,” he said to Strind. “and we are sure going to block it.”
The young man, had no opportunity to ask questions, for Texas Jack followed his statement by going to work.
With his bowie he slit a long hole in the skin-side of the teepee nearest the foe, and then said quickly:
"Follow me, all of you. We are going to give those redskins the surprise of their lives.”
Into the teepee went the four whites.
“Now,” spoke Texas Jack, his handsome face expressive of grim determination, “the Pawnee and I can take -care of the five. They are coming this way, cutting a road through the teepees. You, Strand,, will stay here with Miss Wellington. Cut a hole—a small one—in the back end of this, teepee, and you’ll be able to spot the four savages who will creep through the grass toward you. The moment you see a head, plug it! Make the hole low down, and both of you lie flat on the floor, so as to escape any bullets that may be fired.”
The instructions were given rapidly, and at the conclusion5 of his speech Jack turned, saw that the Pawnee had been using his knife 011 the other side of the teepee, and at once hurried through the hole that had been made.
The line of teepees was about three hundred yards iiv length, and the two scouts had gone nearly half-way, and were in the open space between two of the habitations when a shot was fired from the meadow. The bullet went uncomfortably close to the Pawnee’s head.
Xhe four Indians from the field'had seen the white men, and had acted accordingly.
Quick upon the report, Texas Jack fired, and then, knife in hand, dashed to the side of the teepee beyond him, cut a hole, then turned, supplemented the rifle-work the Pawnee had been doing, and would have drawn his companion out of harm’s way if his ears had not been greeted with the cheering reports of rifles from the direction of the teepee where lie had left Herbert Strand and Mary Wellington.
He stood and looked at the meadow, and when the firing ceased, and there came no movement from the grass, he said:
28
THE BUFFALO. BILL STORIES.
"The four will not trouble us any more. The-ones we failed to get Strand has knocked over. Now for the five.”
The words had scarcely left his lips before he heard shouts coming from the hill beyond the cabin. He looked in that direction, and saw fivd Indians tearing down the slope, and behind them Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill.
As he was gazing at the sight a suspicious noise in the teepee next beyond the one he had just operated on with his knife brought him to a realizing sense of his own danger.
He sprang through the hole, the Pawnee after him.
They had just got inside when a knife-blade was seen to penetrate the skin on the other side of the teepee.
The two scouts fired the same instant, and as they heard the yells and groans that succeeded the shots they ran out of the door and confronted three terror-stricken Sioux.
The bullets of the scouts had killed one of their number, and they were crouching at the end of the open space, seemingly incapable bf action.
When they saw two rifles pointed at them, and no mercy in the eyes of their enemies, they prostrated themselves, and covered their heads.
Texas Jack went up to them, removed their weapons, and then saying to the Pawnee, “Guard 'em!” ran out to witness the wind-up of the fight in Paradise Valley.
Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill had come down the hill at a tearing pace, and getting the five redskins within range, had opened fire.
The shots brought out Herbert Strand, and he lent his assistance in wiping out the quintet of desperate wretches.
Texas Jack remained a pacific spectator to the scene.
When all was over, he went up the road and met his fellow scouts.
“All well?” asked Buffalo Bill anxiously.
“The game is ours,” was the response. “Only two alive, and the Serpent is taking care of them.”
Herbert Strand and Mary Wellington approached the invincible trio.
The young woman was pale, but there was a light of happiness in her lovely eyes. She believed that her troubles were over.
The Indians guarded by the Pawnee were bound, and as prisoners accompanied the party of Buffalo Bill out of the valley.
Although it was afternoon, it was resolved to leave the scene of blood at once. Not one of the party had a desire to stay overnight in the place.
A fire was built, dinner was cooked and eaten, and then preparations for departure were quickly made.
There were ponies in plenty in the Indian camp, and
one of them was selected to pack the gold taken from the crotch of the sycamore-tree.
Two sullen-faced white men went along with the joyous party of the king of scouts.
The future held out no glittering hopes to Quicksand Quick and Buck Swinny. The gallows was in Availing for them, and the gallows got them.
On the journey to Fort Fetterman, Mary Wellington related the story of her capture by a band of Sioux led by Rushing Water.
She was within a few hours' distance of her destination—the home of a cousin who was dangerously ill —when the attack was made. The scout who had gone ahead had been seen and killed before the Indians came to the buckboard with its two occupants, the young woman and the driver. Resistance was useless, and the driver made none. But the savages slew and scalped him, and then carried away the young woman, who afterward became known as the White Queen.
Before leaving Paradise Valley, Buffalo Bill, haviJfJ. in mind the ponies that had been left behind by himseu and his companions, cut several large bundles of Yneadow grass, and bestowed them behind the saddle of the Indian pony that was to carry him out of the valley.
His own animal and the others, as well, were found where they had been hobbled, and thereafter the journey was pursued with more comfort and satisfaction by the three scouts.
Buffalo Bill was not surprised when he found that the three Indians captured in the canon beyond Paradise Valley had released themselves and escaped.
The party reached Fort Fetterman without incident.
A stay of a week was made, and when the White Queen resumed her journey toward civilization it was as the wife of Herbert Strand.
Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill, and Texas Jack accompank^j the happy pair to the nearest station of the 'Union cific, and, of course, big, faithful Hant Hampton was not left behind.
Once Strand looked at the three scouts, and pointed meaningly to the sacks of gold.
Three scowls greeted this attempt to show substantial appreciation of invaluable services.
One year later, in one of the handsomest residences of a large and prosperous Illinois city, Buffalo Bill sat in the comfort of a large, cushioned armchair and dandled a baby on his knee.
He thinks the world of William Cody Hickok Omahaa-dro Strand, and predicts that he will be one of the great men of the Middle West.
THE END.
