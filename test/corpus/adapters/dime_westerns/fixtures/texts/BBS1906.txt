CHAPTER I.
A FIGtiT for life.
Down a narrow, wind-swept canon which separated two buttes of the desert madly dashed an Indian pony bearing upon its back the bound body of a tall and muscular man. The time was late forenoon, and the heat was intense. The air was filled with flying sand, and the man, who had his senses, had long siijce shut his eyes to keep from being blinded. Suddenly the pony stepped into a badger-hole and fell to the ground with a broken leg and a dislocated shoulder. The man bound to the animal’s back tried to free himself from his bonds, but the effort was vain. The bonds were made of stout ' strips of leather, and had been put on by an expert at the business.
The pony, after ineffectual struggles to proceed on three feet, lay down and began to whinny piteously. In this position, all of one side of the man touched the ground. His face was upturned to the blazing sun, and the cords were drawn so tightly about his neck that he found it impossible to turn his head. His wrists were tied together and strapped *to his sides, and his legs were almost* bound with leather thongs, while other’ thong?,
reenforced by several riatas, secured him to the pony. The tightness of the bonds had swollen the flesh, and the man suffered horribly. His throat was parched, his ♦ eyes, opened after the accident to the animal, were bloodshot, and he breathed with difficulty.
The canon was bare of trees or brush, and the reflected heat from the bare sides of the buttes and the stretch of sand between them added to the horror of the man’s situation. He was utterly without hope. The canon was many miles from the main trail across the desert, and no ljuman being, he despairingly told himself, would ever think of making a habitation in this desolate, sun-cursed spot.
The pony did not try^to .agnjfe get to' its feet, but it twisted and rolled, and more than once, as he felt his body crush into the sand with the weight of the animal upon him, the man skirted the edge of death. But at last the struggles of the pony ceased, and, lying partly on its side, panting and pain-oppresSed, it turned its head and looked into the swollen countenance of the bound rider with such an expression of misery in its soft, dark eyes that the man for the moment forgot his own sufferings in his deep commiseration of the poor animal’s condition.
THE BUFFALO
BILL STORIES.
He could not speak; his mouth was too dry, his lips were too swollen for that; but his eyes talked, and this is what they said:
“You poor, poor pony! You have brought me here to die, and die horribly, but you are not to blame. You are and have been an innocent tool in the hands of a blackhearted master. Your heart is all kindness, and you suffer, and know not why that suffering has come. I would help you if I could, but I can do nothing. We must both die, and the sooner death comes the better.” The pony, as if it had understood all that the sympathetic eyes said, turned its head away to snort and make vain attempt to arise to its feet.
Something had alarmed the animal. What was it? The mail tried to look, but his positipn was such that lie could see but on one side of him. There was nothing there but the bare gray sloping butte and the shimmering expanse of sand.
A scries of shrill, crackling yelps proceeding from the other side explained the fear that was agitating the pony. A band of coyotes, the wolves of the prairie and the desert, were approaching.
The man knew that, under ordinary circumstances, no more cowardly wild animal than the coyote was ever let loose upon the continent of America.
But hunger and the taste of blood have in numberless instances transformed these slinking, snarling beasts into fierce, ravening creatures. The man’s tongue clucked. A horror greater than that which had hitherto confronted hjm now stared him in the face.
The yelping grew in volume. The pony twisted its body so that the man could see the butte upon the other side. He shuddered as he looked. Obliquely cutting the butte was a deep gulch, and out of it a band of coyotes were trotting. There were more than twenty of them, and they were making for the disabled animal. When within ten feet of the animal they stopped. The man tried to shout so as to scare them away, but only a wheezing noise issued from his throat.
Presently two of the coyotes, large, gaunt beasts, with lolling tongues, cautiously approached the pony.
Again the man essayed to shout, and the sound he made so startled the coyotes that they quickly slunk away. But they did not go far. The fact that they were not pursued, that the man made no hostile demon- . stration, seemed to puzzle them.
After a few minutes' wait they again approached their prey. The pony neighed loudly, and they stopped, turned, trembled, but did not retreat. The man knew that every minute that went by would give them an increase of courage, and that before long he would be face to face with death in a most terrible form. Once they attacked the disabled animal and got the taste of blood all the cowardice in their nature would depart, and the wild savagery of the wolf would sway their actions.
The two came nearer and after them slowly trotted the others. The pony in an access of terror got to its feet and made a step forward, only to fall again. As it went down the coyotes leaped upon it, and then began a scene that was one frightful riot of blood.
The main assault was made on the pony’s breast and neck. The man lay with his head upon the animal’s rump and his feet against the neck. Amid the cries, yelps, frantic struggles., snapping of savage teeth, and in an atmosphere- rr.ade sickening by the smell of blood and the f .id breath of the wolves," he’found that his feet were
no longer bound to the pony's body. The coyotes had bitten through the leathers in their efforts to get at the flesh of their victim.
A wild hope suddenly sprang up in the man's breast. Perhaps he might regain the use of his limbs, be en-tirelv- free of his bonds before the coyotes, having had their fill of horse-flesh, should turn their' savage attention to him.
He was lying, as he had been most of the time before, with his side touching the ground. Coyotes covered the body of the pony, who was now beyond all suffering. The" tail of one brushed liis face, the feet of others rested upon his breast and legs. But thus far no bloodthirsty attention had been paid to him. His body, protected by his buckskin suit, did not appeal to their appetites as did the warm hide of the pony. Therefore, he was satisfied that for some little time he would be safe from attack if he did nothing to provoke it.
Before long some of the coyotes moved from the neck and shoulders of their victim and began to bite and mangle the flesh of the thigh. Soon what the man had anxiously looked for came to pass. . The leathers holding his head were severed, and, these being a part of the system which held the middle of his body, becar^ loosened and permitted such a play of muscle that t». riata fastenings fell apart, and the man was freed from enforced contact with the body of the pony.
But his wrists and ankles were still bound together, and, until he had regained the use of his hands and legs, he could not hope to escape the fate that had befallen the disabled animal. He rolled over and over until he was several yards from the yelping, blood-crazed beasts.
Now he lifted his wrists to his mouth and bit at the leathers with savage desperation. And, as he bit, he tugged and tugged. At last the leather gave way, and, with hands free, he began with feverish earnestness to untie the knots of the cords about his ankles. When the work had been successfully accomplished the man staggered to his feet, only to fall down again. Suddenly he remembered that his weapons had been taken from him by the fiend who had doomed him to a horrible death. In his breast pocket was a flask of whisky. He was not what is called a drinking man, but he kept the flp^H about him for emergencies. An emergency had nu^P" arisen, and the spirit fulfilled the purpose for which it was used. It took away the thirst, it put new life into the man’s veins, and, after a few swallows, he again got to his feet, this time to stay there.
A coyote, perched upon the body of the pony, turned its head and looked at the man. The beast s jaws were dripping with blood, and its small eyes scintillated with ferocity. The man stepped backward, and then cast a look about for a stick or a stone. Idis eyes fell on a stone, and he was stooping to get it when the coyote sprang upon him.
But, if the savage animal’s movement was quick, so was the movement of the man. Straightening up in a flash, he caught the coyote by the throat, and with one powerful swing and twist snapped the bones of the neck. As he did this, the whole pack attacked him. And now ensued a battle royah With neither pistol nor knife, he stood one man against two score ravenous wolves and fought with the desperate valor of a knight of old. Using the dead coyote as a club, he repelled the upward leaps for his throat, and, like a windmill in action during a hurricane, he laid about him until the

ground was littered with disabled wolves. But still the beasts came on, and at last one more cunning thaii his fellows seized a moment when the valiant fighter’s strength was giving out and leaped upon his back. The man felt the teeth of the beast in his shoulder, and, dropping the dead coyote, he threw his hands backward, caught the attacking enemy by the legs, and tried to pull the beast off. The action was the signal for an onslaught from in front. As the attack was made, .the man, realizing his awful danger, fell backward upon the sand, crushing the beast upon his back in the fall. Then, before the savage animals could mass upon his body, he sprang to his feet, beat off the coyotes hanging to his arms and tearing at the buckskin bf his breast, and with clenched fists and the perspiration streaming from his face, stood at bay.
There was a moment’s respite, and then the coyotes advanced for another attack. The yelping, snarling crew were close upon him, and he was calling up all his strength for what he felt must be the final struggle, when a shout of encouragement reached his ears. Quickly following the shout came the report of a pistol. The rr'votes’ ears pricked up at the sound, then dropped in-tly. They stopped in their onward course, and when a second shot was fired, and one of their number fell dead, their courage evaporated and they scudded from the spot and passed out of sight in one of the many depressions along the face of one of the buttes.
It was a horseman who had come to the rescue of the man who had so gallantly fought the wolves. He rode up laughing hilariously.
The man looked at him, and was both amused and astonished. The rescuer was of middle age, but no larger than a ten-year-old boy. He had an immense head covered with curly black hair, and a face that would have stopped a clock. The eyes were gimlet holes, the nose a knotty protuberance as wide as it was long, and the mouth an immense gash. There was but a suggestion of a chin, and a thick, overhanging lip had the same relation to it as a shelf to the incline of the bracket that supports it. The neck was thick and short and rested on a slight, supple body. Long arms,
■ almost readied to the ground, hung like flails from tua narrow shoulders. '
In spite of the dwarf’s ugliness, the impression made upon the man in buckskin was g. favorable one. The laugh was expressive of good nature, and there was both good nature and sympathy in the smile with which he greeted the person whose life he had probably saved.
“Must ha’ worried ye a bit, didn’t fiiey? Waal, they air treacherous cusses. Kaint bet on em ter be cowards all ther time. Hurt any ?” .
“Nothing to speak of. Got a little bite in my shoulder, but I reckon the buckskin absorbed most of the poison of the teeth.”
“I.cmme see.” The dwarf dismounted, and the man stooped so that the wound might be examined.
In order to permit a proper inspection, the buckskin garment was removed, and, when the dwarf had announced that the teeth had not penetrated deeply, he proceeded to dress the wound, proper medicaments being found in a leather medieine-case, which the little man took from the breast pocket of his buckskin jacket.
“Are you a doctor?” asked the subject of this application.
“No an’ yes. I sarved fer a year under a horse-doctor,
an’ what he knowed I l’arned. What’s good fer horses is shore good fer humans. I hev fixed ye seguro, bet yer surcingle.”
“For which, as well as' for your coming up in the nick of time, I wish to thank you. What you have done for me places me forever in your debt.”
The earnestness of the tone caused the dwarf to blush. He looked into the man’s handsome face, and saw that it betokened a brave, honest character.
“Don’t mention it,” he said, with an assumption of indifference. “I' just happened erlong, an’ that’s all thar is of it. An’ now tell me: What air ye doin’ hyer? Must ha’ come on that pony, eh?”
“Yes. The pony broke his leg, and the wolves attacked him. At that time I was on the pony’s back, tied hard and fast?”
The dwarf’s little eyes blinked furiously. “Some one hev been tryin’ ter put ye out o’ business, I reckon.” “I'll tell you the story after we have struck a spot wrhere there is some shade. By the way, have you any water in that canteen of yours?”
“Sure,” repliejd the dwarf hastily. “I orter trotted it out afore. Take a big pull. Thar’s lots more whar that kem from.”
After the man had taken a drink the dwarf took his pony by bridle and led the way to the gulch, out of which the coyotes had come.
The trail followed the bed of the gulch, and, after traveling half a mile, they came to a clump of mesqult bushes and the guide stopped.
“Thar’s a cave 011 t’other side o’ them bushes ?” he said. “In thar we’ll 'find shade an’ coolness.”
The pony was secured, and the dwarf pushed through the bushes and entered a small cave, the man following.
After the man had been furnished with meat and drink the dwarf produced cigars, and said: “Now I reckon ye kin talk with some comfort.”
“Yes, and it’s the first comfort I have experienced since early this morning. My story is a strange one. Before I begin let me ask your name.”
“Thomas Harryman. Never use it, though. My friends an’ my enemies call me Tadpole Tom.”
“Do you object to the nickname?”
“Never a mite. I like it. Call me Tadpole, an’ ye’ll please me.”
“All right, for I am sure we are going to be great friends. My name is Cody, William F. Cody.”
The dwarf, who had been sitting, sprang to his feet, his face pale, his wide mouth twitching.
“Buffler Bill!” he gasped. “Buf-fa-ler Bill!”
“The same,” replied the king of scouts, regarding the dwarf in amazement. “You are startled. What’s the matter?”
“Matter? Nothin’, nothin’.”
He sat down again and buried his face in his hands. Buffalo Bill was puzzled over the little fellow’s queer demeanor. He waited a few moments, and, as the dwarf did not speak and continued to keep his face averted, the scout said:
“I must know why you are acting so strangely before I begin mv story.”
The dwarf drew a deep breath and looked up. He spoke hesitatingly. “I would like ter hear ther yarn afore I open up. I hope ye’ll oblige me. for a heap depends upon ther story of yer adventures.”
Buffalo Bill considered awhile. “Very well,” he said.

at last, “I'll favor yon. If I did not believe you to be a square fellow, I wouldn't speak.”
“I’m s’archin’ fer ther truth,” was the sober reply. “Then I'll assist you in getting it.”
CHAPTER II.
THE CAVE OF MYSTERY.
“Two days ago I crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico, having partly accomplished the work of dispersing a band of Chiricahua Apaches, for many months the pest of the border. Their chief. Whistling Raven, succeeded in eludwig pursuit, but the Texan rangers, with whom I was associated, assured me that he would be taken care of should he ever show himself on this side of the river.
I left the rangers at the crossing and alone started across the desert for Fort Winthrop. When night fell I camped on a hilly oasis, about thirty miles to the south. It was in a wooded ravine, and I saw no sign of human being when I selected it.
“Some time after midnight, while I was sleeping soundly, I was set upon by a small band of Apaches, led by Whistling Raven, i was bound hand and foot, and early this morning was secured to the back of a wild Indian pony, and the animal was cockle-burred and turned loose on the desert.
"But, before this inhuman move was taken, Whistling Raven, who speaks English, said to me: ‘Buffalo Bill,
I am not doing this because I hate you and desire to inflict the most cruel .punishment that I can think of upon you, but to satisfy the wish of one who is, and has been for years, your remorseless enemy. He it was who told me where you might be found. He it was who suggested that you be strapped to the back of a pony and sent forth to die a horrible death on the desert/
“This statement surprised me greatly. Who could this enemy be? I asked the question, and Whistling Raven refused to satisfy my curiosity. All he would say was that my enemy was a white man, and that I had once done him a mortal injury. Now, all the injury P have ewr done has had as sufferers those who have deserved all they got, to wit, the criminals of the border, and the savages who have gone forth to slay. So I could only conclude that my enemy belonged to the criin- ■ inal element, and that he was taking revenge for some punishment that had been righteously inflicted upon him. Bui, try as I would, I could not guess the identity of the man.
“1 he ride over the desert was one long agonv, and when the pony reached the can.on below and the accident occurred I gave up hope. You know the rest.”
“Did you----” The dwarf got thus far with a question and then stopped.
“What were you going to say?”'asked the king of scouts.
‘‘Xothin\ nothin’ of consequence,” replied Tadpole Tom, hi some confusion.
“I don't like mysteries,” continued Buffalo Bill sternly. “I owe you a great deal. I had taken a liking to you, and I had hoped that there might be frankness between us. Has the mention of my name changed your feelings'toward rne ? In a word, now that you know who I am, an you a friend or an enemy?”
Tp;'v)ok' Tom, thus pushed to the wall, looked the scout full in the face. His voice was steady as he re-
plied: “Neither. For the present I must occupy a neutral position. Were you other than Buffalo Bill, I could say now, and say it heartily, T am your.friend.’ ” “This is a queer state of affairs,” said the scout, as he scratched his head. “It can’t be,” he added suddenly, “that you are a friend of the mysterious person who seeks my death?”
The dwarf was about to answer when some one called from without:	/
“Tom, are you there?” The voice was a quavering treble.
“Yes,” was the quick reply. “Shall I come out?”
“No, I’ll come in.”
The bushes were parted, *and a 'trembling old man stepped into the cave. His face was of the color of ashes, and his hair and beard were as white as snow. The only features that did not suggest age were the eyes. They were dark, brilliant, piercing.
“I see you arc not alone,” he said, in. surprise. “Who is this gentleman?”
Tadpole Tom answered instantly: “He is an old friend of mine, and his name is Johnson. He lives in Santa Fe and was a scout for the government until he got into a row with an officer. Then he war bouncjjfc, an’ fer a month he hev been shiftin’ fer himself.” Buffalo Bill listened to this string of lies with a countenance full of wonder. Luckily the old man was not then looking at him.
“He thinks of strikin’ out fer Mexico,” continued the dwarf, with an even countenance. “Hasn’t any sorter use fer Arizona. Knows ther Yaquis an’ may settle among ’cjn.”	,
The king of scouts, believing that, in spite of the dwarf’s assertion of neutrality, the little fellow was showing friendship by his deception, concluded not to disabuse the old man’s mind of the false impression it had received.
“For Mexico?” repeated the old man. “If he does lie may meet with a friend of mine.”
“Who is your friend?” asked the king of scouts.
The old man looked the questioner over from head to foot. The scrutiny appeared to satisfy him, for he said: “He’s the brother of the chief of one of Yaqui villages. His name is Whistling Raven.”
Buffalo Bill could hardly repress a start. The dwarf looked at him warningly. “I have heard of him,” he said, trying to speak with composure. “But—he is an Apache. How is it that his brother is a ruler among the Yaquis, a nation that has nothing in common with the Apaches? But, perhaps, I am mistaken. Whistling Raven may not be a member of the nation which he now represents.”
“The Raven and his brother arc both Apaches,” returned tlie old man suavely. “Jumping Jaguar, the brother, was taken prisoner by the Yaquis when he was a child. He was adopted by the chief, and when he grew up he married a Yaqui squaw. Last year he was chosen chief. Speaking of Whistling Raven reminds me of something. Do you know', or have you ever met, Buffalo Bill?”
The king of scouts looked hard at the old man, but saw in the senile face only mild inquiry.
“I—I have met him,” he said.
“What do you think of him?”
Here was a question that caused the person addressed to smile.
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
5
“I’ll tell yon what I think of him,” put in Tadpole
Tom. “He-”
“I don’t want your opinion,” interrupted the old man sharply. Then he said to the puzzled king of scouts: “I have a reason for asking the question. My control has given me a sketch of Buffalo Bill’s character and has warned me to beware of him should he ever cross my path. It may be that my control is an evil spirit. You look like a good man. Perhaps your opinion may not coincide with what has come to me from the other world.”
The king of scouts wondered greatly. What manner of mhn was this, and into what kind of a nest had he fallen. Was the old man a harmless lunatic, or was he —the scout did not speculate further, for the old man, continuing nervously, said: “I will withdraw my question. It need not be answered until you haveilearned what my control would have me believe. Tom, conduct Mr. Johnson to the Grotto of Shades. I will follow presently.”
When the scout and his guide were outside Buffalo Bill said: “Who is that old man ? And what is he doing here in this forsaken spot?”
“He is my master,” was the sober reply. “His name no one knows. The Indians look upon him as a superior being, one who has control of the forces of earth an’ air, an’ who has intercourse with the dead. The few white people who know of him call him ther Wizard of Windy Gulch.”
“This is Windy Gulch, is it.^’
“Yes, an’ thar’s another an’ a larger cave a short distance up ther gulch. Ther old man wants ter rig up a seance, I reckon.”
Buffalo Bill was ill at ease. He was in a peculiar situation. Every circumstance seemed to point to one conclusion. He was in danger. There was poison in the air of Windy Gulch. Death lurked in the cave toward which he was going. The dwarf was not his enemy, but neither was he a friend. Hold! Was it not an act of friendship to conceal the identity of the man he had saved from death in the canon at a time when the announcement of the scout’s name might have had an extraordinary effect upon the mind of the wizard?
They were near the other cave when Buffalo Bill stopped. “I refuse to go any farther,” he said resolutely, “until you have satisfied me as to your intentions. You have said you were neutral, and yet you have acted otherwise. I must persist in regarding you as a friend. Now tell me, is the wizard the foe of Buffalo Billr’
“I don’t know, an’ it was because I was in doubt on ther p’int that I saddled ye with ther name o’ Johnson. Better wait an’ find out fer yourself.” The dwarf did not look the scout in the face when he spoke these words.
“If I can convince yoti that I am an honest man. will vou stand by me in case I need assistance ? ’
“I will not lift my hand agin’ ye,” was the .evasive reply.
“Why can’t yoti come out and tell me what’s m your mind? What sort of a combination have I run up against?”
“Maybe ye’ll diskiver afore long what ye air so anxious ter know.”
“I am unarmed,” continued the scout, now both vexed and angry. “You have two pistols. Lend me one.” Tadpole Tom’s little eyes sought the ground. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Hanged ef I don’t,” he
replied, and, so saying, he handed one of his revolvers to the king of scouts.
“Thank you,” said the recipient quietly. “Now I know how you stand. I'll take in the cave.”
In a lateral gash of the hill a few yards from the intersection with the gulch was the entrance to the larger cave. There were trees about it, and on one side was a spring of clear, sparkling water.
As the scout and his guide were about to enter the cave, the sound of a woman’s voice reached their ears. She was singing the refrain of a popular song, and the voice, a clear soprano, evidenced the training of a good schopl.
Buffalo Bill showed his amazement in the look which he bestowed upon Tadpole Tom. “That’s ther old man's darter,” the dwarf explained. “She runs ther shebang.”
They went into the main chamber of the cave. It was about twenty feet square and contained several willow chairs and a conch of skins.
“Thar air two rooms beyond,” said Tadpole Tom. “Ther fust is ther grotter, whar ther old man does his hanky-panky business, and ther room at ther back of it is ther darter’s boodwor an’ sleepin’-apartment."
Ill the grotto Buffalo Bill sat down and waited for the appearance of the wizard. And, while he waited, he tried to evolve order out of the chaos of his thoughts. There had come mystery upon mystery. It was strange to find an old man of distinguished appearance, of education, in a desolate gulch of an Arizona desert, but it was stranger still to find a woman, probably young and certainly educated, in the same place. What did it all mean? What had caused the old man and his daughter to take up a residence in such an out-of-the-way spot?
The dwarf did not remain in the grotto. He went to the rear room, and Buffalo Bill could hear him in conversation with the old man's daughter.
Soon she appeared, and the king of scouts felt his pulses tingle as he gazed at her.
She was not over twenty years of age. and as pretty as a picture. Small, slight, gowned as if she had just stepped out of her dressing-room in a metropolis, with bearing graceful and proud, she seemed so strangely out of keeping with her surroundings that Buffalo Bill's wonder grew deeper.
Fixing her ravishing brown eyes upon the scout, she said sweetly: “Yours should be golden fortune, sir.”
“I did not come here to have my fortune told,” stammered the blushing Indian-fighter. "It was vo hear something that your father wishes me to hear.”
“Oh, my father. ’ She laughed merrily. "He's such a queer person.-’ She patted the golden hair upon her temple, and then, with a peculiar smile, took a seat near the door.
The avails and ceiling of the grotto were draped in somber black, and the furniture consisted of a deal table and three chairs. TW table was covered with black cloth, and upon it was a glass globe resting upon a small tripod.
“T il go out an* see what is keepin’ ther old man," said Tadpole Tom, after the conversation had Iasi, d some ten minutes.
The conversation had taken in general subjects. The girl had shown no curiosity regarding the history or objects in life of the tall, handsome visitor, and had talker! mainly of the social pleasures of New Orleans, whieh she said had been her home for many years.
6
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
After the dwarf’s departure she grew confidential.
“I am only here on a visit/’ she said. “My father met with business reverses some time ago and insisted upon leaving New Orleans and going to some place where men do not congregate. IJe is a scientist, and has been a student of. the occult for many years. He possesses wonderful powers. Rightly has he been called a wizard.” “Is he a spiritualist?” asked the scout.
“Yes^and I have been his assistant.”
“In what respect, if I may ask?”
“He says that I am a medium, and that his control, an Indian princess, will speak better through my mediumship than through other methods of communication.
Buffalo Bill had always associated the subjects of mesmeric or hypnotic action, which her statement suggested, with pale cheeks, lackluster eyes, and a general appearance of lassitude and weakness. But this subject seemed the embodiment of vigorous health. Her cheeks were full, her complexion was blush-rose, and her lips were red. There was nothing about her that suggested mental strain.
She divined his thoughts, for she went on quickly and without a shade of annoyance: “I haven’t acted as assistant for a long time. I am glad of the respite, for every trance leaves me a sick woman.”
At this juncture the wizard entered. There was a broad smile on his face. For some reason which he could not explain, Buffalo Bill did not like that smile.
“I am sorry to have kept you waiting,” he apologetically said. “I thought your horse might have strayed away, and I went down the gulch to look for it.”
‘The king of scouts experienced a chill. Had the wizard seen the half-eaten body of the pony in the * canon? And if he had seen the body what construction had he placed upon the sight?
“I went as far as the canon,” the wizard continued, “and looked up and down it, but saw nothing in the animal line except a pack of coyotes gathered about some object on the sand. I wonder what it was?”
“It was my horse,” said Buffalo Bill bluntly, and now determined to force matters to an issue. “I was on my way to see Tadpole Tom when my horse ^stepped in a badger hole, broke his leg, and was set upon by the coyotes. I could do nothing to save the animal, though I managed to kill one or two of the beasts before I left the spot.”
Tadpole Tom nodded his head. The bluff that the scout was making appeared to please him.
The explanation seemed to satisfy the wizard, for he said nothing'when Buffalo Bill had concluded.
But the daughter had something to say. She had listened to the‘talk about the disabled pony and the coyotes, and more than once had shot a keen look at Buffalo Bill. He had noticed the look, and was on his guard wlien she spoke.
“You must have had other adventures before you reached the canon?” she observed quietly.
“Nothing to speak of.” he modestly replied.
“I inferred that you had had trouble,’^she coolly went on, “because I perceive that you have but one weapon, a pistol. You are the first frontiersman I have met who did not carry a rifle and a knife.”
The king of scouts gave her a sharp look. Her countenance was serene, and its expression was that of innocent interrogation.
The old man, who had been fondling the glass globe, here broke in before Buffalo Bill could reply. ^
“The last time I was in Santa Fe,” he said, “I saw a mountaineer in a poker-game stake his rifle and his pistols against the money of the other fellow. He was down to cases. He lost, and that night he held up a teamster, secured a revolver, and took to the hills. lJer"
haps our friend here may have struck hard luck and--
“You are right,” interrupted the king of scouts, who now cared not what kind of a play he made. “I have been in hard luck. But I am going to try a new deck and see if my luck won’t change.”
“Good plan,” said the wizard. Then he addressed the girl commandingly: “Stella, come here!”
The command was obeyed. The ’girl drew her chair up to the table and placed her hands in those of her father. »
Buffalo Bill looked on quietly. It was his opinion that a climax of some kind would soon be reached.
After some muttering, a few passes, and the usual hypnotic preliminaries, the, girl’s head dropped to her breast.
.Then the wizard spoke.
“Who and what is Buffalo Bill?” he asked.
“A trickster, a robber, and a murderer.”
The king of scouts’ face reddened with wrath. He would have spoken had he not caught the eye of Tadpole Tom. The eye said : “Don’t.”
“What has he done to deserve the character which you have given him ?”
“I cannot tell you.”
“Why can’t you tell me?”
“Because there is one here Reside me who says that an explanation might defeat the ends of justice?”
“Who is that one? A man or a woman?”
“It is a woman, or, rather, the ghost of one.”
“A woman who was wronged by Buffalo Bill?”
“Yes.”
“Say, professor, this is simply rot, ’ the king of scouts burst in, regardless of the head-shaking of Tadpole Tom. “I know Buffalq Bill, and I give you my word he is neither a trickster, a robber, nor a murderer. He never wronged any one. Your control is a fraud. Call her off and get a new one.”
The wizard showed no offense at this interruption. On the contrary, he looked pleased.
“That is what I wanted,” he said, “an expression of
your opinion. I was afraid that my control had been deceiving me.”
“You* bet she has been,deceiving you,” quickly returned the king of scouts. “And now I would like to ask you a questibn. Why do you take such an interest in Buffalo Bill? What is he to you or yours?”
“Nothing whatever,” was thefcply, given with such an appearance of frankness that the king of scouts was staggered. “An acquaintance, one who has done me several good turns, asked me to use my occult faculty in getting at the truth regarding this famous scout and fighter. I do not know1 his object.”	& *
“His name? What,is it?”
The wizard hesitated. Then he smiled. “Why are
you, who are not Buffalo Bill, so anxious to pry into matters concerning him?”
“I km his friend. He has no better,” sturdily replied the king of scouts.
Ilis friend, are you? It was Stella who spoke. She

had come out of her trance, and her face was pale and her eyes had dark shadows under them. “And what is your opinion of his character?”
“Didn’t you hear me? I have just given it.”
“I did not hear you,” she coldly said.
“There is no need to repeat it,” put in the wizard, with a frowning face. “It is all complimentary.”
As he'said this he turned his back, and the next instant Buffalo Bill’s chair slid from under him and the heavy cloth ceiling of the grotto fell upon and enveloped him.
Before he made a struggle to get from under the incubus, strong hands grasped the cloth about his throat. Other hands, the hand's of a man, rendered assistance in reducing him to utter submission.
After he had been bound the cloth about his face was cut away, so that he could breathe freely.
He looked about the grotto. The girl had gone. The wizard and Tadpole Tom stood over him.
“You have betrayed me, you scoundrel,” the trapped scout hissed, as he fixed his wrathful eyes on the dwarf.
“Don’t ye get'‘excited/’ was the cool response. “Thar ain’t any call fer it.”
CHAPTER III.
FROM ONE DANGER TO ANOTHER.
“I ought never to have entered this cave,” Buffalo Bill said, more to himself than to the two men who were looking at him. “If I had knocked down the dwarf, ran back, stolen his horse, and rode out of the gulch, I would have done a sensible thing.”
“You would have done a very foolish thing,” replied the wizard. “I knew you when I saw you down at Tom’s cave, and if you had tried to leave the gulch in the manner you have slated, you would have been shot dead.
I was ready for just such a move, and I would have potted you beyond the shadow of a doubt.”
“Who are you ?” interrogated the scout. “My enemy, the man who hired Whistling Raven to put me on that pony’s back?”
“I am not the man,” was the response, and there was the ring of truth in the tone. “I am but an humble instrument of justice.”
. “Justice!” sneered the prisoner. “I like that! Do you believe I am a bad man ?
“I believe you deserve punishment of the most harrowing description,” returned the wizard calmly. “It is no use for you to ask questions, for I won’t answer them.”
“You can at least inform me what you intend to do with me.”
“I can’t even , do that I must first get my instructions.”
.The two men went out, and the king of scouts was
aI°ne*	r	1 f	,1
' Half an hour passed, and then from the front chamber of the cave came a deep barytone in cold, merciless
speech:	.
“William F. Codv, you have taken the first degree,
and you are still alive. The hour is approaching when
you shall be given initiation into the frightful mysteries
of the second degree. You may live through it. My
hope is that vou mav, for I want you to suffer as no man
diver suffered before. There are other degrees, and from \ ,
all you cannot escape with life. My decree is that you shall die, but death must come slowly. You have committed a terrible crime, and ordinary punishment will not suffice.
“If I had desired your immediate death I would never have had you placed on the back of that pony. I knew there was a chance for you to escape, but I knew at the same time that before you escaped you would have to undergo an .experience that would harrow your soul. Another experience awaits you.”
The voice ceased, and Buffalo Bill, torn by curiosity, called out: “Drop this mystery. Who are^you?”
There was a Mephistophelian laugh, and then the answer: “I am a man whom you have never seen.”
“Come in and let me look upon you so that I may get acquainted with the biggest scoundrel that ever went unhung?”
“I believe I will oblige you?” was the cool reply, and into the grotto stepped a young man of about thirty, with coal-black hair, long black mustache, eyes deep-set and piercing, an aquiline nose, and high, narrow forehead.
There was a sinister smile on his face as he sat down by the table and lool<ed at the victim on the floor.
“How do you like my looks ?” he asked.
“You look like the devil,” was the quiet answer.
“You are complimentary. Satan is a very interesting character. He is rather cunning, I have been informed.” “How long have you been doing the wizard business?” questioned the scout, with a sneer on his face.
The villain started. “So you have spotted my double play, have you?”
“Your eyes gave you away. Besides, you are a bad actor. I knew all the time it was no old man who was doing the wizard act.”
“I did not care whether you penetrated my disguise, or whether you took me for wdiat I represented myself to be,” returned the young man nonchalantly. “I had you in the door, and that’s all I wanted. But life is a little dull in these diggings, and so I thought I would have a little fun with you before putting on the screws.”
“I suppose your wife was in on your game of fun.” “My wife?” lifting his eyebrows. “I wish I could say she was.”
“And, as you can’t, will you tell me who she is?” “Interested in her, are you ?” regarding the scout with amused interest. “Well, she is a daisy, and if she hears me I don’t care.”
“I do hear you,” spoke the subject of his remark as she came into the grotto, “and I would thank you to keep your compliments to yourself.”
The young man’s face turned a deep-red. He muttered something and then marched out of the grotto.
The girl waited until she was sure the man had left the cave, and then she surprised Buffalo Bill by saying: “I am not your enemy. Be not dismayed. I will spoil that fiend’s plan if I can.”
“What is the plan?- Do you know?”
“I have an idea. I think he intends to lower you into a den of rattlesnakes.”
The king of scouts felt the cold chills creep over him. “But,” he said, with a forced smile. “I wouldn’t like that.”
She turned to leave, but he stopped her.
“Why can’t you release me:” he whispered. “X am

not afraid to tackle the young devil and his imp, Tadpole Tom, with or without weapons.”
She bit her lip, then stamped her foot. A moment later Tadpole Tom came into the grotto. He noticed the frown on Stella’s face and smiled.
“Better take a spin in the open air, hadn’t ye?” he said, with a grin.
The girl tossed her pretty head and walked out. Tadpole Tom’s eyes followed her, and there was strong disapproval in their expression. “She means well,” he said to Buffalo Bill, “but she has been wrongly advised.”
“By the man who is my deadly enemy?”
“No, by the agent of ther man who has it in fer ye.*’ “By which you would have me infer that the agent is the fellow who was here a few minutes ago?”
“Sure.”	#	#
“And how do you stand? I must confess that you are a puzzle. You have stood by me, and you have stood against me. Isn’t it about time for you to leave your position on the fence, take a decided stand, and stay there?”
can’t do anything that would displease her,” was the troubled answer.
“Does she desire my death?”
“I don’t think she does, but she is engaged ter be married to ther man who aims ter do ye up.”
“See here, Tom,” said Buffalo Bill earnestly, “you are wise to some things, but you are in the (^ark as to others. This girl, whose wishes you do not to run counter to, told me that she is my friend and that she would spoil the plan of my enemy’s agent if she could. Why can’t you help her? And what is to prevent you from releasing me now? Don’t you think that we three —myself, the girl and you—are not able to cope with one man ? Why, I could handle half a dozen such fd -low's myself.”
Tadpole Tom did not answer at once. He went out of the cave and remained several minutes. When he returned he said: “We can have half an hour to ourselves. I am goin’ ter tell ye something an’ if ye can smooth away some of ther rough places in my story I may get in an’ do somethin’ fer ye.”
It is needless to say that the king of scouts was all attention at once.
“That girl’s father saved my life,” began the dwarf, “an’ when he died I found myself saddled with ther promise ter stay by her until she got married. Two years ago she got acquainted with a feller over in Mo-bile whar she war visitin’. I wasn’t with her then, bein’ down with veller jack in N’Orleans.
“I pulled outer ther fever game by ther skin of my teeth an’ war convalescin’ when she came back. Nater-ally she told me ’bout ther young man. He had gone ter Arizona on some hefty business, an’ they war ter be married arter he had transacted it. I wanted ter know all about ther feller, an’ she said he war a planter an’ ther nicest gentleman she had ever met.
“As I wanted ter know more about him I asked her what business had sent him ter Arizony. She wouldn’t tell f< r awhile, acted kinder queer about.it, but finally, knowin' she could trust me, she said he war lookin’ fer a man who had done him a fearful wrong. The man’s name war William F. Cody.”
“Ht-re is this mystery again,” growled the king of scouts. “I have said more than once that my skirts are
clean of wrong-doing. I have faults, for I am human, but no crimes can be laid at my door. What does this enemy of mine charge me with?”
“That’s what I asked Stella Bayne, an’ she told me. She said that you had murdered a woman who was related in some way to the man she had become engaged to. Not only that, but you had stolen a fortune that belonged to ther woman.”
Buffalo Bill laughed loudly. The dwarf stroked the place where his chin ought to have been. He stared hard at the prisoner.
“May I ask who it was that I murdered?” said the king of scouts, a gleam of amusement in his eyes.
“Her name war Adah Lafarge.”
‘‘Oh, I begin to see.” The scout at last had found the clue to the mystery. “How was the murder done?’ he asked quietly.
“Miss Lafarge had been presented with some valerblc jewels, an Indian chief doin’ ther presentin’, an’ you, so I war told, got on her trail, killed her, an’ stole ther gems.”
Buffalo Bill smiled. “.Now that you have seen me, do you believe that yarn ?”
Tadpole Tom answered promptly: “No, I don’t.”
“I am glad you have said that,” responded Buffalo Bill,^ without waiting for me to give my side of the affair. Here it is: Adali Lafarge, a beautiful adventuress, went to the village of the Zuni-Mojaves, ingratiated herself with the handsome, unsophisticated chief and induced him to rob the cave of gems and elope with her. He was deserted after he had been with her but a day or two, and the woman, with the gems, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, pushed on over the mountains to meet her lover, one Brazos Jake, a half-breed outlaw, who was waiting for her, the robbery having been carefully planned by them weeks before.”
The pursuit by the king of scouts and the strange adventures that he met with have been detailed in another number of this library* •
Concluding his story, Buffalo Bill said: “I recovered the stolen gems, and they were returned to the cave from winch they were stolen. If you doubt me, go to the village of the Zuni-Mojaves and you will learn that I have spoken the truth. As for the thief, she was killed, but not by me. A tomahawk, thrown by an Indian ally of hers, missed its mark and clove her skull. The proof of this statement may also be obtained in the village of which I have spoken. So you see, I have committed no murder, and I have not stolen property belonging to Adah Lafarge.”
“I believe ye,” said Tadpole Tom impulsively. “I shoref see it all, now. This Craven Starr, that’s ther feller s name, has put up a yarn ter deceive Miss Stella, all ther time knowin’ that ye did right. But right ain’t a stickin’ in his craw ter make him easy on yer. No, hff’s got it in fer ye because ye war responsible fer ther woman’s death an’ also responsible fer ther rekivery of ther jewels. I am goin’ ter tell ther gal all about it, an’ then you’ll be all right.”
“I would rather be all right before you tell her,” said Buffalo Bill. “Release me and we will go to her.”
“All right. I’ll catch fits fer interfering maybe, but I don’t care. Right’s right, an’ that settles' it.”
He squatted by the side of the prisoner and had be-

gun the work of release when the man, who had posed as the wizard, softly entered the grotto. As his eyes took in .the scene he sprang forward and dealt the dwarf a powerful blow under the ear. Tadpole Tom fell backward and did not move. After possessing himself of the weapons that the dwarf carricd on his person he coolly addressed the prostrate scout.
“You are a pretty slick one, and it’s lucky I suspected what was going on. I told Stella that she was a fool for taking Tom along- with her, and now she’ll know it. Gave things away, didn’t he?”
Buffalo Bill did not answer.
“Well, it doesn’t matter what he told you. He is not on the inside, and so could not tell you everything.” “Thar is one. thing I can say now,” said Tadpole Tom, as he raised his head from the ground, “an’ that is this: Ye have been tryin' ter make me think ye war an agent. Now I know better. Ye air ther main squeeze, an’ yer name ain’t Patterson, fer it’s Starr.” x The young man showed his teeth.
“So,” he hissed, “you are a-traitor. Well, if it will do you any good to know, I’ll acknowledge that my name is Starr, Craven Starr.. But I am not”—he paused and bit his lip,v for Stella Bayne had come in and was looking at him'with'warning eyes.
“Release that man!” she commanded. Her tone was harsh, insistent. 1	1
Craven Starr obeyed, and Buffalo Bill, looking at him, saw that he was smiling.
The cords were removed and the king of scouts arose, stretched himself, and then, stooping, lifted Tadpole Tom to his feet. “You are going with me,” he said. “This is no place for you.”
“You may do as you please, Tom,” said the girl indifferently.
The dwarf’s lips twitched as he replied: “I shall stay here until I have done my duty.”
“Very well, suit yourself. Now, Mr. Cody,”/turning to Buffalo Bill and speaking gently, “I would advise you to leave this gulch at once. I will see that you are not followed and molested by Mr. Starr. Tom, go to my room and stay there until I call you.”
The dwarf went out of the grotto without looking at Buffalo Bill. When he was out of sight the girl spoke to Starr.
“You made one mistake when you allowed me to come here.” she said coldly- “You did not figure on the appearance in this gulch of the man you were pursuing. Now that I have seen him, I know that you have lied to me. Henceforth we are strangers/
She stepped up to him and snatched a pistol from his belt and handed the weapon to Buffalo Bill.
“I could not let you go,” she said, “without means of protection. Down below the other cave you will find Tom’s horse. Take it and ride away.
“And leave you here at the mercy of this wretch?” cried the king of scouts, in hot disapproval. “Not much. I'll stay with you until Mr. Craven Starr has been put into a position' that will make it impossible for him to hurt anybody.”
“I am obliged to you;' was the quiet reply, “but I do not fear him. Tom will protect me. And—I do not wish to have him punished. Go, and have no fears on my account.”
“Yes, go,” said the voice of Tadpole Tom from the door of the boudoir, “she’s all right.”
And out of the cave of mystery, puzzled, dissatisfied, and angry, walked the king of scouts.
He reached the lower cave, and, looking below him, saw nothing but the bare sides of the gulch and the sandy opening into the canon.
“That horse she spoke of must have wandered awav,” he thought.
Just then a score of Indians appeared at the mouth' of the gulch. Buffalo Bill saw'them and looked about for a hiding-place.
Thercave was not to be thought of, for the Indians if they rode up the gulch, as they probably would if they were commanded by Whistling Raven, would likely stop and enter the cave.
There was a narrow trail across the gulch. It led upward and was bordered by mesquit bushes. By taking it the scout might be able to reach the canon in the rear of the Indians. They had not yet seen him, and if he moved at once he might escape observation.
Hurrying' along the trail, he soon arrived at the summit of the hill. Before him were two boulders with a narrow passage between them. He was going through the passage when the ground under his feet gave way and he was shot down some twenty feet into a rocky pit. The pit was alive with rattlesnakes, and where the heavy body of Buffalo Bill crushed in among them there such a hissing and rattling, and such an overpowering odor, that it is a wonder that the scout’s senses ^vere not temporarily paralyzed.
It was the other way. The snakes were for the moment the cowards, and before they could rally for an attack that would mean death, Buffalo Bill had jumped. In front of the pit was an abrupt descent of forty feet. The base was the sandy bed of the canon, and there was but one bush growing on the almost perpendicular bank.
The king of scouts struck this bush, uprooted it. and with it fell to the sand where he lay for many minutes with breath gone from his body.
But no bones had been broken, and when he rose on his elbow and looked about him, he saw that he had escaped the Indians. They had left the mouth of the gulch and were probably riding along it on their way to see Craven Starr.
Presently Buffalo Bill turned his eyes in the opposite direction, and was both surprised and pleased to see Tadpole Tom’s horse hobbled in the sand not twenty yards away.
.CHAPTER IV.
BUFFALO BILL’g REPRISAL.
The horse was a tough mustang, and Buffalo Bill sized him up for a fast stepper and a stayer.
Attached by a leather string to the horn of the saddle was a canteen. Unscrewing the mouth cover, the sa-m found that the canteen was filled with clear, cold water.
“That’s good.” he said to himself. “Now I wonder if there is any grub in the bag under the canteen." The bag was opened, and the contents found to consist of jerked beef, hardtack, and dried figs.
“Bully for the woman. Slices all right.”
He mounted and rode northward. While passing the mouth of the gulch he saw Tadpole running toward :he canon. When the dwarf beheld the king of scouts he
10

waved his hands and shouted. “Stop! I’ve got something for you.”
Buffalo Bill reined up. Tadpole Tom was soon at the side of the mustang. “Stella said I might find you down here if I hurried. Whistling Raven is at the cave, an’ he said something that made Stella want to get quick word to you. One of ther Injuns with Raven is a Yaqui, an’ this Yaqui, who is Whistling Raven’s brother’s brother-in-law, told ther Raven that ther Yaquis have got a white prisoner that they’re shore goin’ ter burn at ther stake as soon as ther Feast of ther Minneba comes on, an’ that’s next month. The name of ther white man is Hickok.”
“Wild Bill ?” ejaculated the scout in strong amazement. “Same hotnbre. He went down inter ther Yaqui country to find a cousin of his’n an’ got inter a row with some Yaquis who objected to his ridin’ through their lands. Thar war some blood-Iettin’, an’ Wild Bill war overpowered an’ taken to ther main village."
'‘Had your mistress any advice to give me?”
“No. She said as how I was to tell ye this an’ let ye do as ye pleased.”
“And it pleases me to turn about and ride like the wind for Mexico. I wish you' were going with me, Tom.”
“So do I, but I can’t leave my mistress.”
“Did this man Starr hear Miss Bayne when she requested you to run down and see me ?”
“No. He war lyin’ down in ther grotto fast asleep. He’s ai opium fiend, an’ he hit ther dope just after ye left ther cave.”
That night Buffalo Bill camped not far from the spot where he had been trapped by the Apaches. He slept but little, and the night passed without incident. He had really not feared a pursuit by the Indians under Whistling Raven, for he had the faith to believe that that strange young woman. Stella Bayne, would find some way to prevent Starr from giving any further instructions to the Apache chief.
A week’s travel without adventure brought him into the hillv country beyond Chihuahua. One night while encamped on the banks of a small stream Tadpole Tom rode up.
“Knew I’d find ye,” said he, as they shook hands, “fer ye left a clear trail. Wanted ter come, and Miss Stella consented arter she’d got some pointers from Whistling Raven.”
‘T’m awfully glad to see you, Tom, pointers or no pointers,” replied Buffalo Bill, with a smile of pleasure.
The dwarf’s eyes glistened, and his homely face shone with joy. He was like the faithful dog who has been patted on the head by his master.
“Thar air Yaquis an’ Yaquis,” he said, “an’ some of ’em air easy ter git along with s’ long’s ye treat ’em right. But thar air others who air as savage as ther ’Paches. Wild Bill was cotchcd by ther savage crowd, an’ it’s ter tell you this an’ also whar he is bein’ kept dial I’m hver ter-night.”
“Anything more?” asked the king of scouts, as the dwarf paused and looked thoughtfully at the ground.
“Nothin’ that Miss Stella told me, but I diskivered somethin’ ter-day that I don’t like a little bit. I knows when I’m bein'* follertd, an’ if I warn’t follered ter-day then my sense-works is shore outer kilter.”
Buffalo Bill looked grave. A dark suspicion entered his mind, but he instantly dismissed it.
• “Who followed you ? Do you know ?”
“Not fer sure, but I knows this, though. Thar war two of ’em, an Indian an’ a white man. They tried ter keep outer my sight, but arter I got onto ’em I played fox, an’ it warn’t long afore they got a leetle keerless."
“A white man and an Indian,” repeated Buffalo Bill musingly. “Might they not have been Whistling Raven and Craven Starr?”
“That’s what I been a-thinkiiv,” returned Tadpole Tom, with a sober expression. “I don’t like it,” he added, “fer I don’t see how they found out I war goin’ ter Mexico. No one war around when Miss Stella gimme ther points, an’ when I started off ther Injun an’ Starr war given ter understand that I war goin’ ter Tucson fer prpvisions. That route is north an’ west from ther canon, an’ I war miles ther other way an’ outer ther canon afore I seen that I war follered. Kin ye figger out how them cusses got onter my game?”
“One of them might have been listening while Miss Bayne was giving you her message,” said Buffalo Bill. “Starr may have promised to let me alone, but he never meant to keep that promise. I would not trust him farther than I can sling a cat.”
“No more would I, Mr. Cody, but he war asleep when she talked with me, doped ag’in, ye understand.”
“I’ll bet he was pretending, Tom. He fooled the girl, and now he is on my track and will try to get me in a hole. I believe,” he went on, “that he planned to have me fall into that den of rattlesnakes.”
“What’s that ye say?” exclaimed the dwarf, in marked astonishment.
The king of scouts told his companion what happened after his parting with Stella Bayne.
Tadpole Tom’s face was a study after the revelation had been made. It was some time before he spoke. Buffalo Bill, regarding him curiously, wondered what was in the dwarfs mind.
“I seen Starr,” said the little fellow slowly, “moseyin’ around that den when I went out ter look fer him while ye war in ther big cave an’ Miss Stella war a-talkin’ ter ye.”
“That was suspicious,” commented the king of scouts. “And where were the Indians then? Have you any idea?”
“They war at ther mouth of ther gulch.”
This surprising statement caused Buffalo Bill to draw a sharp breath. The suspicion that he had put down arose and persisted in remaining to disturb his mind.
Tadpole Tom was twiddling his thumbs, and his eyes were lowered.
“Then it was a put-up job,” said the king of scouts harshly. “I was sent forth from that cave with the idea that I would see the Indians and be forced to retreat up the hill to the den of rattlesnakes. And who sent me? Craven Starr? No. Stella Bayne? Read me that riddle if you can.”
“Ye kain’t make me read it so’s ter compermise Miss Stella,” replied the dwarf stoutly. “She never did ye dirt. She ain't that kind. Why, didn’t she stake out my mustang fer ye? Would she have done that if she wanted ter see ye die in that den? No, Mr. Cody, she’s squar’ as a die. She didn’t know nothin’ about ther Injuns, an’ she supposed that ye’d go down to ther canon, find ther mustang, an’ ride away. If she hadn’t counted on just sich a program she wouldn’t have sent me arter ye with that news about Wild Bill.”
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
ii
The king of- scouts appeared impressed with this view of the case. His countenance cleared. 'With a smile he said: “Tom, you are a loyal friend. I like the way you stick up for your mistress. Y ou have probably hit the bull’s-eye. Starr is the villain, and he has tried to checkmate her moves in my favor. And now we must try to checkmate him. We are in an exposed position here. After what you have told me I realize the necessity of moving. It is not very dark, and the trail is plain. We must make several miles before we stop for the night.”
After they had eaten a frugal' supper the scout and his companion rode on. Before long the trail took them into one of the wildest sections of the Sierra Madre Mountains. Less than a day's travel would bring them into the Yaqui country.
The vegetation was luxuriant, and the growth pf the vines and underbrush was so rapid that what would be a clear trail one week would, if let alone, be a mass of vines the next.
At times the progress was very slow, and Buffalo Bill, who had provided himself with a machete, the heavy, sword-bladed knife used by the Mexicans to cut their jvvay through thickets, was obliged to use it to Vender passable the way before them.
Tust before midnight they came to a bridge of vines which crossed a chasm through which tumbled a fierce mountain stream. It was serviceable for man or beast and was crossed in safety, the animals being accustomed to such p/imitfve contrivances.
Arrived at the other side of the bridge Buffalo Bill said: “Here is the place to camp. The enemy must cross that bridge to keep tip the pursuit, and that circumstance will put ‘them in our power.
There were plenty of good hiding-places, and the two friends watched and waited until daylight. But no enemy appeared.
After breakfast the king of the scouts announced his intention to go back on the trail and make an investiga-
tl0”l want to make sure,” said he, “that we are being pursued by enemies. It may be possible for me to Jearn what plot, if any, has been hatched against me. I will go on foot, and if, as I suspect Whistling Raven and Craven Starr are not far away, I shall not be gone
^Tadpole Tim urged the scout to be careful, and saw him glide away with some misgiving.
Buffalo Bill went swiftly along the trail, and less than a mile from the bridge his venture was rewarded by the sight of Whistling Raven, Craven Starr and five Indian braves. The party had camped m a hollow, and
breakfast was just over.	.
Screened by the foliage above,them the king of scouts saw Starr and the Indian chief light pipes and sit down
under a tree.	.	,	,
It was a time for conversation, and picsently Starr said: “Don’t forget what I told you about lom. He has forfeited his right to live. Kill him outright, and
leave Buffalo Bill to me.”
Whistling Raven grunted. ^ hy not kill Buffalo Bill? Too much fool play. Child do better.
“I reckon you are right, Raven, replied Starr, but I am not running this circus. The real YVizaid of W indy Gulch is the boss. T am sorry you did not meet him.”
“I did meet him. He talked with Whistling Raven in
the cave of Tadpole Tom. He said many things. Pie took the Raven for a blinking papoose. Let it be so. Whistling Raven no care.”
Starr laughed. “That means that as long as you get paid for your work it does not matter what kind of a fool yo\ir employer is.”
The Indian nodded his head. He puffed at his pipe a few moments and then continued. “But why so much fool work? Wizard hate Buffalo Bill. Why not kill him quick?”
“I'll tell )\du why. The wizard is a peculiar individual. The fact that he keeps in the background shows it. Why not come out in the-open and fight like a man?” The villain shrugged his shoulders. "Because the wizard has read books and has filled his head with a lot of cranky ideas. He has made up his mind to punish Buffalo Bill in such a way that when death comes it will come as the afterclap of something that will make the victim’s soul sizzle. He aims to put Bill through a course of devilish sprouts before shutting his w ind off for good and all. He calls these sprouts degrees. The first degree was the ride on the back of that pony which furnished meat for the coyotes. The second degree was the drop into the den of rattlesnakes. By the way, I thought that degree would wind up the performance, and Buffalo Bill must have been playing in the biggest kind of luck when he got safely out of that den.”
“What if the luck does not leave him? He is a great *warrior, Buffalo Bill. The spirit that has protected him may be more powerful than the spirit that controls the Wizard of Windy Gulch.”
“Wait until we get him into the Yac}ui country and you will see that his spirit will be out of a job. If he gets through the third degree with a whole skin then I’ll be ready to throw up my job. How quickly lie bit at that Wild Bill yarn.”
The listening scout would have used strong language had it been safe for him to open his mouth. So he had been fqoled to the limit. In shame and anger he waited for further revelations.
“I knew that he would go through fire and water for Wild Bill,” the villain went on coolly. “Thev are old pardxs, and c-ach has saved the other's life I don’t know how many times. Lucky I thought of Iiickok when I was talking with the wizard and wondering what kind of a snap we could work to get Buffalo Bill-into Mexico. And it was the frozen truth about Wild Bill’s trouble with the Yaquis. The part that wasn’t truth was the capture and the proposed burning at the stake. Hickok came off first best in his scrap with the Indians, and the last I heard of him he was hiking for Durango.”
The talk soon ended, and preparations were made for continuing the journey.
Buffalo Bill, satisfied as to the intentions of his enemies and puzzled over the identity of the fjend, who, according toVStarr’s statement, was the real Wizard of Windy Gulch, hurried back to the spot where he had left Tadpole Tom.
The story he told had a depressing cffect upon the dwarf.
“So I am to be killed, am I ? I don’t know anything about this other wizard. I never saw but one.”
“Are you sure that the person who played wizard for my benefit is the one who had played it before that?” “The dress was ther same, an’ ther voice was ther same.”
“How about the build., the height?”
Tadpole Tom considered this point. Buffalo Bill, watching the expression of his face, saw the signs of pain. The answer to the last question came with difficulty.
“Thar—was—a difference, Mr. Cody. J’d rather not say anything more.*’
•“There is no need/' responded the king of scouts gently. “I know what you think. Yon have been deceived. The blow is a hard one, but you will recover from it/’	i
“I don’t believe she ordered my death,” the dwarf said, with trembling lips and moist eyes. “She is a queer girl, but she has always been my friend,”
“No more do I, Tom,” replied Buffalo Bill warmly. “This man Starr hates you because you tried to help me. Admitting as we must, that the \Vizard of Windy Gulch is Stella Bayne and that she is my enemy, the enemy who has planned to torture and then kill me for a crime I never committed, still there exists no reason why she should wish you out of the way. And now I ^want to ask you a question. Did you give Miss Bayne 'my version of the Adah Lafarge matter?”
“No. I shore would have done so if I hadn’t thought she’d concluded to stand yer friend. Now, I wish I had, fer I'm satisfied she doesn’t know ther truth.” “W'hat relation does she bear to the Lafarge woman? Have you any idea?”
= “She had a half-sister who left New Orleans some ti?ne before I got acquainted with her father. Maybe ther half-sister war Adah Lafarge.”
Conversation came to an end. for in the near distance could be heard the sound of horses’ hoofs.
Buffalo Bill left his hiding-pl,ace close to the bridge, and, crawling to the brink of the chasm, looked down.
He had before this made an inspection of the land at the end of the bridge and1 had seen a hole in the bank just below the point where the vines were secured. This hole was not more than seven feet from the surface of the ground, and’ was partly screened by bushes.
After giving some instructions to Tadpole Tom the scout, lowered himself to the hole, and, crouching be-f hind the bushes, waited for the approach of the enemy.
Craven Starr was the first to arrive at the bridge. Instead of attempting the crossing he halted and beckoned to Whistling Raven.
“This bridge may be all right,” he said, “but I am not going to allow my pony to put foot upon it until some of the Indians have gone over/’
The Apache chief spoke to the five Indians, and they at once started to cross in single file.
“You see,” said Whistling Raven contemptuously “the bridge is strong enough to hold the five.”
At this moment Tadpole, in moving a little closer to the bridge so as to get a better view of what was going on, mada such a noise that the attention of Whistling Raven was directed toward the thicket that concealed him.
Instantly his rifle was at his shoulder, and a bullet sjx.rl across the chasm.
The five Indians were then more than half-way over ihf bridge.
A scream of agony followed the report of the rifle. Buffalo Bill was then out of the hole.
lie heard the scream, and a savage light flashed from his eyes.
Standing under the bridge, he reached upward with his machete, cut the vines, and the bridge fell.
CHAPTER V.
AN ADVENTURE AND A SURPRISE.
The five Indians fell with the bridge, and as their bodies shot downward to be crushed on the rocks seventy-five feet below, Buffalo Bill began to climb up the bank.
He was seen by both Whistling Raven- and Craven Starr, and the Indian chief had made ready to fire at the scout, when a rifle cracked just above Buffalo Bill s head, and the Indian spun around and then toppled into the abyss.
Craven Starr, startled by the shot, quickly gave evidence that his given name fitted his character. Without firing at Buffalo Bill, he fled for cover, and, therefore, no bullet crossed the chasm as the king of scouts mounted the bank.
Hurrying to the cover which he had occupied before his descent to the hole, he was delighted to find Tadpole Tom alive and unharmed. The dwarf was grinning \\ ith savage delight, and his first words were: leclcon old Raven isn’t ther only fox in ther woods. Thought he d plugged me, eh ?” A series of chuckles.
1 hought he d put ther kibosh onter ther friend of Buffler Bill, did he? Waal, I showed him a trick, didn’t I? IIow d that air scream strike ye? Sound like ther ginooine article?”
It did, lom/’ replied Buffalo Bill, with a look of appreciation. 1 thought you had gone under.”
They moved to another spot for better protection against a possible rifle attack by Craven Starr, and there coolly considered their situation.
“This Yaqui business is off,” said Buffalo Bill. “'We must manage somehow to get to the other side of that chasm, and then hunt Mr. Craven Starr.”
“He’ll strike out fer ther north—fer Windy Gulch,” said the dwarf.
"No, he won’t, Tom. He’s down here to kill you, and work some Satanic job on me. lie’ll not go back to Stella Bayne with the story of failure. Can’t you guess why? You shake your head. Then 1*11 tell you. Craven Starr is in love with the girl. She has said that she will not marry him until he has carried out hqr wishes in regard to me. He is a coward, and, therefore, I do not expect to meet him in a fair fight. Ilis Indian tools are gone, but he can find others in this country. I’ll bet he knows where to look for them, and while we are trying to beat that chasm he will be hiking for assistance.”
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
13
“We’11 have ter go up tlier mounting an’ git above tlier water,” said Tadpole Tom.
“Maybe not. It may be possible to put the bridge back in place. We’ll wait awhile; long enough to give Starr a chance to make himself scarce, and then I’ll investigate.”
Ten minutes passed, and while the king of scouts was occupied about his mustang Tadpole Tom, without saying anything to his companion, left the covert and walked boldly up to the brink of the chasm. He stood there for a minute in full view from the other side, then turned and went back to the covert.
Buffalo Bill, who had just missed him, had a frown on his face when the dwarf returned.
“Why did you expose yourself?” he asked.
“I knowed Starr had gone,” was the quiet reply, “an’ I wanted ter take a look at ther chasm.”
Buffalo Bill looked steadily at the unmoved countenance of the dwarf. Soon a smile that sent its )mth to Tadpole Tom’s heart lighted up his handsome face.
“I know why you went out there,” he said. “You did it to make sure of the situation, to protect me. Now you know that I can venture out with safety. You are all right, my boy, I hctve had many pards, but none truer than you. There, there!” as the little fellow's lip began to quiver, “get a smile on your face. We understand each other, anjl we are going to stay by each other. Come, help me with this riata business. I , want your rope as well as mine.”
“What air ye goin* ter do?”
“If the thing is possible, I am going to lower myself down the chasm and recover the loose end of the bridge. See?”
“An’ ye can do it. When I squinted down ther gap \~yc now I seen that ther end ye cut war caught on a jagged rock ’bout three-quarters of ther way down.” “Good! The combined riatas will give over a fifty-foot reach, and, they are strong enough to hold a heavier man than I am.”
It was not long before the king of scouts stood on the point where the end of the bridge had been.
After securing one of the riata-ropes to the trunk of a tree that grew near the brink, he adjusted the other end under his arms in a knot-loop, and then, with his hands grasping the rope where it touched the edge of the chasm, began to slide downward.
On the bank Tadpole Tom watched him with anxious eyes.
Slowly the king of scouts went down the rope. It held, and nt last his feet touched the severed end of the bridge of vines. It had, as the dwarf had stated, caught 011 the long, sharp end of a rock which projected from the side of the chasm. Twenty feet below the
water bubbled and foamed, as it swept fiercely along its narrow, precipitous channel.
Buffalo Bill slid to the end of the rope, and, planting his feet against the bank, reached down and grasped the thick knotted vine-work of the, bridge. It was heavier than he had anticipated, and it was all he could do to lift the end up to his waist.
It was now free of the rock. Holding it with one hand, with the other pressed against the bank, he slid down until his feet rested on the projection of rock. Then, with his back to the wall, he used both liands to fasten the vines to his person. He found holes through which he could thrust his arms, and it did not take him long to complete the work.
“Got it fixed?” called Tadpole Tom, from above. “Yes;” but there was no note of satisfaction in the scout’s voice. “I have got it fixed, but I’m doubtful about getting up with it. It’s very heavy, and the riatas may not be able to support it.”
“If ye air in doubt, don’t try ter come up,” urged the dwarf. “’Tain’t 110 time ter go inter any experimentin’ business. If ther riatas should break an’ ye should fall, that would be ther last of ye. Better give up ther notion.”
Buffalo Bill pulled at the sagging weight of the bridge, and shook his head. “I’ve bitten off more than I can chew,” he said to himself, in angrv disappointment. “I ought to have taken into consideration the weight of the bridge before I started to come down here. Drat it, but I hate to acknowledge myself beaten! I won’t!” His jaws squared. “I won’t give it up yet- There must be some way to surmount the difficulty.”
“Air ye goin’ ter give it up?” questioned the dwarf. The king of scouts quickly replied: “No! let me think awhile.” He did think, and at last a plan of raising the bridge occurred to him. “I’ve got it, Tom!” he shouted in triumph. “No danger, and a sure thing.’’
“Glad ter hear it. What’s ther new scheme?”
“We will use vines. Take my machete and cut the longest and stoutest vines you can find. Make triple strands, knot them securely together, and, when you have got a rope long enough to reach me and allow' tying-length at the top, fasten the top end to that tree and lower the slack to me. Do you understand?”
“Ye kin gamble that I do. That air scheme is a peach. Air yc safe in waitin’ thar until I git ther rope finished ?”
“Yes.”
“Then off I goes.”
It took Tadpole Tom about half an hour to execute the commission that had been entrusted to him. There were vines in plenty about the chasm, and he had no difficulty in finding the kind that Buffalo Bill desired.
When the rope of vines was lowered, the kins?/ <- f scouts expressed his satisfaction. It was strong enough
for the purpose, and when the end had been attached securely to the end of the bridge Buffalo Bill unfastened the vine^ from his person, and then ascended to the top.
On firm ground, he began to look quizzically at Tadpole Tom.
“Come here/’ he said.
"The dwarf approached, wondering what was, in the scout’s mind.
“You bear the appearance of being a tough proposition,” he said, as he took the little fellow by the hand; “but app«arances are often • deceitful. How’s your muscle ?”
He ran his hand up the dwarf’s right arm and felt of the biceps. The dwarf grinned and stiffly crooked his elbow. The muscles were like whipcords.
“I reckon you’ll do,” was the judgment. “In raising that bridge I need a partner, and that partner mustn’t be an infant. I did not look upon you as an infant, but I certainly never imagined that you were packing around the arms of a giant. Tadpole, you are a base deceiver. Why didn’t you tell me that you were able to hold your own with the biggest man that ever walked?”
The dwarf’s immense mouth opened in a grin that expressed such a high degree of delight that the king of scouts was more than ever pleased that he had made friends with this faithful, honest, simple-minded creature.
They set at work to raise the bridge. Buffalo Bill went in front, and as he pulled on the rope Tadpole Tom would wind the slack around the tree. It was a hard pull, and took all the strength that the king of scouts could muster. But he was one of the most powerful men in America, and, after many rests, the end of the bridge reached the top of the chasm and was made fast to the tree, the rope £>f vines which had raised it being used in the fastening.	1
The forenoon was now about half-spent, and, after crossing the bridge on their horses, the scout and his diminutive partner rode rapidly along the trail in pursuit of Craven Starr.
When they started out, Tadpole Tom asked: “Whar do ye expect ter meet up with Starr?”
“The nearest village is Los Huecos, and for years it has beeen the haunt of outlaws. In fact, the outlaws run the place. There are rurales there, to be sure, but I have heard that they are hand in glove with the desperadoes. Starr must know the reputation of Los Huecos, and it is/ny opinion that he will ride to the village, pick up a crew of cutthroats, and then start to round me up. I think he will figure that I have gone upstream to the summit, and tljat I will make for the road leading to San Rosa.”
“It ain’t yer idee ter ride on ter Los Huecos, is it?” “No. I gave the place the go-by when I was coming from Chihuahua, and I have no desire to pass through it now. We must cut through the woods and try to
strike Starr and his outfit somewhere between Los Huecos and the summit.”
“Supposin’ he’s got a dozen desperadoes along with
him, what then?”
“I don’t think he will take so many. ’ My idea is that half a dozen will satisfy him. But no matter,” added the scout grimly, “whether the number be six or twelve,
I am going to get him. This persecution business must stop, and stop it shall before I am ready to report at Fort Winthrop.”
“I’m with ye, Buffler,” was the quick response of Tadpole Tom. “I owe Craven Starr one, an’ I’d like ter git a chance ter pay it.”
Buffalo Bill scanned the country as they rode along* and near the noon hour, when they had reach'ed a in the hills which led upward and eastward, he said* “We will try that gap. It will take us to a point two or three miles below the summit. The traveling will be difficult, for we have but one machete, but we may the trip in time to overhaul our man.”
Before starting to cut their way through the vines and bushes that filled the gap they refreshed themselves from the contents of their wallets. They sat by the side of a cool spring, and after eating filled their pipes, and for ten minutes smoked in silence.
Ihen Buffalo Bill knocked the ashes from his p*Pe and said: I have been thinking about Wii'idy Gulch* Tom. and I have struck another puzzle. You came away leaving Stella Bayne without'a protector. Craven Starr wants to marry her, and we know that he is a double dyed scoundrel. Doesn’t it look to you as strange that she should consent to your departure, knowing that she would be left alone with a villain of the deepest dye^ With a man she has been holding at arm’s length ever since she left Louisiana?”
Craven Starr is afraid of her. An’ she ain’t a afraid of him. I know what I’m talkin’' about. She ain t afraid of anything. Bersides, he wants ter git her money. He can’t git it if he don’f marry her, an’ he knows he’s gotter walk a chalk-line .till she’s ready ter mosey up ter tlier altar with him.”
“I see. And I suppose she will stay at the cave until he returns, or some word from him or concerning' hiITl reaches her.”
“That’s ther idee. An’ mebbe we’ll take thei* word.” No more was said, and soon the two friends were working through the thickest of the gap.
Buffalo Bill was cutting vines near a tall tree, when a rustling in the branches caused him to stop in Ms labors and look up. Too late to save himself, for at the moment his eyes weVe raised a heavy body struck him in the chest, and he was flung violently to the ground. Tadpole Tom was a witness to the assault, and hurried up to Buffalo Pill’s assistance. lie saw his friend in the clutches of a cougar, one of the largest he had
THE BUFFALO BILL' STORIES.
ever seen, and, without a thought of the consequences to himself, jumped upon the savage animal’s back and began to jab with a- knife.
The cougar, held from sinking his teeth in Buffalo Bill's flesh by the scout’s desperate throat grip, wrenched himself loose, shook off the dwarf, and in a moment more would have flung himself on the little fellow if a rifle-bullet had not entered his brain.
Buffalo Bill got to his feet just as the rescuer came into view. One look at the tall form, and the king of scouts threw up his sombrero and gave utterance to a shout of joy.
“Wild Bill, by the great horn spoon!”
‘Til be derned,” exclaimed the hero of a hundred fights, “if it ain’t my old pard! Put it there.”
And, with hands clasped, the two champion spirits of the West gazed affectionately at each other.
“I heard the noise in the thicket,” Wild Bill explained, “and thought I’d investigate. But I no more expected find you, Cody, than the high-muck-a-muck of Lin-V-jm Vitey. What in tlie name of General Jackson are ^ you doing in the Sierra Madre country ?”
“Let me make you acquainted with the whitest little nian in seventeen States, and then I’ll do the explaining. Mr. Hickok, Mr. Harryman. Wild Bill, shake hands with Tadpole Tom.”
The hands met; the clasp was warm, so warm, in fact, that Wild Bill’s face wore an expression of pain when the hands were unclasped.
“Mr. Hickok,” said the dwarf, “I am glad ter know ye. If ye air a friend of Buffalo Bill, I’d be pleased ter have yer become a friend,of mine.”
“I’d hate to be your enemy," returned the tall scout, with a grimace. Then he added, with a genial smile: “Of course I am your friend. How could I be otherwise, after the high-class endorsement of Buffalo Bill?” vr.r^he three men sat down on the ground, and the king of scouts told his strange story.
Wild Bill caught his breath more than once as the story proceeded. A\ the conclusion he said: “Give me a good description of this Bayne woman. I’ve got an idea in my head.”
The description was furnished. Wild Bill nodded his head.
“Same shemale,” he remarked. “I saw her not two hours ago in Los Huecos.”
CHAPTER VI.
THE ASSASSIN^ SHOT.
, The announcement that Stella Bayne was in Los Huecos was a great surprise to the king of scouts.
“Was s]ie alone?” he asked.
“She was when I first saw her,” replied Wild Bill, “but just before I left the tillage a fellow joined her*
and they had a wordy scrapping-match. 1 didn’t hear all that was said, but I gathered she was as mad as a fjornet because the fellow failed in something she had asked him to do.”
“Was the newcomer a white man ?”
“Sure! a dandified, black-mustached galoot, with a bad eye and a high forehead. Some tin-horn gambler, I reckon.”
“Did cither of them notice you?”
“No; neither of ’em saw me. There is no hotel in the place, but there is a sort of store in a two-story adobe, and the}' let rooms in the upper part. Back stairs from the second story lead to a patio, and from the patio a gate will let you onto a plaza. I was in a back room, looking toward the plaza, when the girl rode up and halted at the gate. She dismounted, went into the patio, and sat down on a bench. Half an hour passed, and then the man appeared. After they left to go down the street, I settled with the tendero and rode out of town. Where the pair were then I don’t know. Out of sight somewhere in the village, I reckon.”
“They had gone to drum up a gang to come after me,” said Buffalo Bill. “Plenty of material there from which to make a selection.”
“I think they will have trouble in finding many men,” returned Wild Bill. “The village is well-nigh deserted. Last week the whole raft of outlaws started on a long raid over Durango way. Going to attack a mine owned by Americans. After the band left, three or four hard ( customers from Arizona hit the place. They are there now, and maybe they’d take the job of trying to do you up. Shanky Simpson is one of them. Remember him, don’t you ?”
“Yes; and he remembers me,” replied the king of scouts, with a hard smile. “I was the means of making him serve five years in the Territorial prison. He is a bad egg, and it won't take much inducement to get him to start after me.” There was a pause, and then Buffalo Bill continued: “I heard that you were over in the Yaqui country, Hickok, and that, after a little misunderstanding with the Indians, you left for Durango. What has brought you here? Going back to the Yaquis?” '‘You’ve struck it. I am going to do what I failed to do a few weeks ago. I went into the Yaqui section to rescue a cousin of mine, John Davie, who is a prisoner among the Indians. He is a mining prospector, and, while doing placer work on the Yaqui river, was captured by one of the wild bands of redskins and taken to a mountain village. His life is not in danger, but he might as well be dead, for the Yaquis intend to hold him as long as he is able to work. You see, these Indians are in the mining business themselves, but they lack the intelligence and the scientific knowledge that Davie possesses. So they use him to find gold for them and superintend the digging.
i6
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
“I tried to get to that village, and was within a mile of it when a gang of Yaquis jumped me. We had a little mix-up,‘and I didn’t get the worst of it, though I was obliged to retreat and lay up awhile for repairs.” Buffalo Bill looked at Tadpole Tom and winked. The dwarf gazed admiringly at Wild Bill, whose modesty was on a par with his reckless bravery. “I am over here,” the tall scout went on, “because I want to come upon the village from a new direction. It is not more than thirty miles from the bridge below here.”
“See here, Hickok,” said the king of scouts, after a moment’s consideration, “help me out in this matter I am engaged upon, and then I will stand in with you on your Yaqui racket. What do you say?”
“Say? I say yes, of course. I am in no hurry; and, besides, I am interested in your affair. There is fun ahead, or I am no prophet.”
Wild Bill had a machete, and the journey up the gap proceeded with less difficulty than before his appearance.
In the early part of the' afternoon the three friends rode out of the gap, and, after crossing a. thickly wooded mesa, fpund tlie trail leading from the plains tq the summit. Selecting a good hiding-place within view of the trail, they dismounted and waited for the appearance of the enemy.
As the moments passed, symptoms of uneasiness showed in the countenance of Tadpole Tom. At last he spoke.
“Buffler,” he said earnestly, “I want to ask a favor. Be easy with Miss Stella. Starr is ther one ye want ter lay out. Ther girl’s got a crazy idee in her noddle,’ an’ I berlieve we can drive it out. Let’s give her a show.”	/
“You didn’t think I intended to shoot her, did you?” replied the king of scouts, in pained surprise. “I have never had any such notion. I am willing to give her a show. If she shall prove amenable to reason, if the facts in the Lafarge case shall open her eyes, then I will let her depart to sin no more.”
. The dwarf exhibited gfeat relief at this promise. “I —I like ther girl,” lie said, “an’ I’d hate ter see her abused.”
Wild Bill looked queerly at the little man as he uttered these words.
Later the tall scout took occasion to whisper to Buffalo Bill: “Tadpole Tom has more than a sneaking affection for this woman. He’s in love with her.”
About the middle of the afternoon the sound of voices reached the ears of the hidden trio. Presently a woman’s laugh was heard. ■
“That’s Stella,” whispered Tadpole Tom, who was now pale and trembling. “I’m goin’ ter look out fer her. Any objection?”
“None in the world, if you are able to do it,” replied Buffalo Bill.	f
There were six persons in the party which shortly rode up the hill to the outskirts of the mesa. Craven Starr and Stella Bayne were in front. Behind them came three evil-faced Mexicans and a tall, raw-boned American. His.low forehead, small, greenish eyes, flat nose, and thick lips betrayed' the ruffian and the brute.
This was Shanky Simpson, the deadly enemy of Buffalo Bill.
The program of the attack had been arranged by the king of scouts. The six riders were within twenty feet of the place of concealment, when the three friends sprang into' the trail. Each was armed with a rifle, and aach rifle was cocked and pointed as Buffalo Bill issued the command: “Drop your guns and throw *up y°ur hands! We’ve got you foul.”
The riders came to- a quick halt, and abject fear was writen upon the faces of two of the party. The two were Craven Starr and Shanky Simpson. Stella Bayne showed amazement, but not alarm. She was about to speak, when Simpson, impelled by desperation, snatcl^ a pistol from his belt and fired at the head of Buffalo Bill.
But the bullet never reached its mark. The king of scouts saw the murderous motion, and ducked just in ‘ time. The next instant Wild Bill’s rifle cracked, and Shanky Simpson fell from his horse and struck the ground a dead man.
The firing of the shot was the signal for the Mexi-cans to act, and the^fight was soon on in earnest. Craven Starr, paralyzed with fear, turned his horse and was about to ride off, when a bullet from Tadpole Tom’s rifle pierced his shoulder and brought a scream from his lips fhat could have been heard a mile away. His horse gave a jump at the same moment and unseated his rider. As Starr went down, the dwarf, disregarding the rah> of bullets about him, ran to Stella Bayne and lifted r' to the grpund. She did not repulse him, though she looked at him strangely.
Hurrying into the bushes, he found a safe place for her, and then went back to the trail.
While Tadpole Tom was occupied with the girl, Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill were having an easy time of it* The three Mexicans were poor shots, and in their fright their marksmanship showed to no advantage. One them, more daring than his companions, leaped to the ground after he had fired one shot and pretended to be mortally wounded. Watching his chance after his companions had been killed, he raised his revolver and took aim at the king of scouts. Coincident with this action a bullet from an unknown source grazed the skull of Wilcft Bill. The shock took away his senses and he staggered forward, and then fell over the body of one of the Mexicans he had slain.
,The fall of the tall scout Jbrought a cry 0f exultation
from Craven Starr, and, crawling on his hands and knees, he essayed to reach the cover of the bushes.
He was near them, when Tadpole Tom came into the trail. The two men looked at each other with eyes of murderous hate, and then the dwarf, with a quick movement, brought his rifle to bear and shot Starr dead.
Buffalo Bill, who had been engaged in tying up the , Mexican who had shot the revolver - but failed to score, raised his eyes as Tadpole ,Tom fired, and, noting the expression on the dwarf’s face, shook his head.
“I am afraid you didn’t give him a show, Tom,” he said reprovingly. “You ought to have made a prisoner _ of him.”	\
“I gave him all ther show he deserved,” growled the . dwarf. ‘‘He 'was a dog, an’ deserved to die a dog’s death.”
Wild Bill was trying to get to his feet as these words were 'spoken. His senses had returned,. and he had heard what Buffalo Bill had said.
.. “I am not mourning the scoundrel’s death,” was his Remark. “He tried to put my light out a minute ago.” “Are you sure of that?” questioned Buffalo Bill.
“I didn’t see him, but who else could have fired the shot?”
“It sounded to me like a pistol-shot,” said the king of scouts; “and Starr’s pistols have not left his belt. By the way,” he continued, “where is Aliss Bayne?
“In ther bushes,” replied Tadpole Tom. “I got her outer ther shootiji’-zone as quick as I could.
The Mexican who had come out of the fight with whole skin turned his eyes on the dwarf, and said: “You looka like pootv good hombre. Gimme cigarette.” Tadpole Tom, with a smile, went to the prisoner, stooped, and lighted a cigarette. After inserting it into the Mexican’s mouth, he arose, and, approaching Wild ^JBill, put Out his hand.
" ' “I am glad ye played safe with that bullet,” he said, in deep earnestness. “A quarter of an inch, an^ ye’d have sailed up ther flume.”
Wild Bill took the outstretched hand and held it for some time. “My boy,” he replied, “I have had many narrow escapes, and I never kick at what comes, if it comes in a fair way. But it always gravels me when I set myself up as a mark for an assassin. 11 hope the assassin is dead. If he isn’t, or if she isn’t, then there’s to be a reckoning in the future.
Tadpole Tom scowled. He drew back his hand. “I hope ye don’t think Stella Bayne fired at ye?”
“Fetch her out, and let’s see what she has to say for herself,” returned Wild Bill coldly.
The dwarf hurried away, his face grave, his mind filled with gloomy thoughts.
He was gone a few moments, and returned with a sour expression on his face.
“She’s skipped/’ was his announcement, “an’ by this
time is half-way to Los Huecos. All ther hosses went ’lopin’ back that way when ther riders left ther saddles, an’ she could easy pick up one of ’em.”
“We must go in pursuit,” said Buffalo Bill promptly. “That woman must not escape us. I haven’t had my talk with her yet.”
1 “And I haven’t asked her about that bullet,” rejoined Wild Bill. “Come on, then. We’ll take the prisoner along with us. The dead cusses we’ll leave for the coyotes.”
“No, no,” pleaded the dwarf. “Ye two stay here. Let me go alone. If she sees me without ye she will stop, but if she sees Buffalo Bill, she’ll ride like the wind to get away. I can induce her ter come back; I know I can. She’ll listen ter me, an’ when I tell her what I orter told her afore, that Adah Lafarge warn’t murdered, an’ that ther warn’t no robbery, she’ll wanter come back. Lenime go alone, won’t ye?”
The king of scouts saw the force of the dwarf’s argument. “Go on, then,” he said. “We will give you two hours. If you are not back by that time, we will ride down the hill for Los Huecos.”
Wild Bill grumbled a little over the arrangement, and after Tadpole Tom had gone he said: “The little fellow means well, but I think he has taken too big a contract. The girl is sharper than a needle; all her actions show that. She'll see through Tom’s game an’ refuse to turn back. You'll see that I am right.”
“I don’t know,” returned Buffalo Bill. “I have a lot of confidence in Tom.”
“He’s a queer citizen. I’ll say that for him, Cody. I am afraid you’ll have trouble .with him if you catch the girl and want to clap her in jail.”
“I have no fears on that score. This affair is going to work out all right.”
'“I think you are overconfident. The air hasn’t cleared sufficiently for you to say that.”
“We shall see.”
The scouts did not stay long at the place where the fight had taken place. They rode dqwn the trail half a mile, and on a level spot near the bank of a small stream dismounted, and employed the time of waiting in smoking and talking. The Mexican prisoner was tied to a tree a short distance from where they sat. He was doubly bound, and the scouts had no fear that lie would get away.
An hour after Tadpole Tom’s departure Wild Bill was stretched out on the ground, snoring peacefully, and Buffalo Bill was fighting bravely against the heavy drowsiness that had fallen upon him.
His head was nodding, when a stir in the bushes close by caused him to raise his head quickly. As he did so the Mexican he had left bound to the tree brushed by him, and, with an ugly-looking knife in his hand, sprang upon Wild Bill.
xS
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
At the instant when the knife was about to descend a shot was fired, and the Mexican dropped dead upon the form of the man he had been about to slay.
The shot was not fired by Buffalo Bill, but by Stella Bayne.
CHAPTER VII.
THE FRIGHTFUL THIRD DEGREE.
Wild Bill pushed away the body of the Mexican and sat up. He stared at Stella Bayne in bewilderment.
“Did you shoot ?” he asked”.
“Yes,” was the reply, given in a steady voice, though her breast was heaving and her face was pale.
“Then all I can say is that you are a thoroughbred. I don’t care what Buffalo Bill thinks. Hereafter I am vours truly to command.”
Stella Bayne smiled. Ths warm color came to her cheeks, and she never looked more beautiful. “And what does Mr. Cody think?” was her question, as she fixed her luminous eyes on the perplexed countenance of the king of scouts.
“I think,” responded the scout slowly, “that now is the time for an explanation. But first, I would ask: Where did you leave Tadpole Tom?”
“I have not seen him since he left you to ride ddVn the trail.”
“You haven’t? Then, what brought you here?”
“My feet,” she replied, with a laugh. “I have not been away from these woods since the fight.”
“You didn’t ride away on a horse?” Buffalo, Bill’s astonishment was profound. He was confronted with another puzzle, and, try as he would, he could not read it.
“I did not. I moved from the spot Tom found for me, but I did not go far.”
She composedly seated herself 011 a rock, and waited for further questions.
“Who untied the Mexican?” asked Wild Bill.
“I do not know. I suppose he untied himself. The first I saw of him, he was stealing up to you with knife in. hand.”
“He did not untie himself,” insisted Buffalo Bill.
“I reckon you're right,” said Wild Bill. “He was untied by an snemy of mine, and that enemy gave the order that I should be killed. That proposition is as plain as can be, for if the villain hadn’t had instructions, he would have carved Cody before he paid his attention to me. He had to pass Cody to get to me, and, though ■he had a good chance to use his cleaver on my partner, he never took advantage of it. Who is this enemy? Why, the person who tried to put a bullet into me up 011 the edge of the mesa.”
Stella Bayne's face took on a sober expression. She cast her eyes to the ground. Buffalo Bill, watching her, shook his head sadly.
“She may not be the enemy who has planned to tv-**' ture me,” he thought, “but she knows who that enemy is, and is keeping silent about him.”
As she looked up and met his gaze his face hardened. “Miss Bayne,” he said calmly, “I am a blunt man, and 1 may as well tell you that before you appeared you were under suspicion. We both thought that you fired the shot which came within an ace of killing Hickok. We now believe that you are innocent of that attempt at murder. Your recent act has shown that you do not desire the death of my friend here. But there are other matters in which you are concerned, and if you can explain your part in them to my satisfaction I shall be more than pleased.”
While the king of scouts.was speaking the girl’s face grew pale. “I see that you suspect me of double-dealing,” she responded, in a low voice, and without looking at him.
“I suspect, or rather I have suspected, that you are the enemy who has been so relentlessly pursuing m<# Tell me, prove to me that I am mistaken.”	£
He spoke with such feeling that the girl’s composure returned. Her eyes were shining with gladness as she said: “You arc mistaken; but 1 can-scarcely blame you for thinking ill 0f me. I have been most peculiarly placed. I could not tell you what I knew. I could only give you aid whenever it was in my power so to do. I am not your enemy. I have said so before, and you believed me. I want you to believe me now.”
He was about to speak, when Stella Bayne went 011:
“I don t want you to accept my bare word. I will prove to you that I am your friend. I tried to save you tvhen you were in the cave at Wrindy Gulch. If you had gone north, as I wished, you would have been saved the experiences you have met with in Mexico.”
“One moment,” put in Buffalo Bill. “Yon say yoyr wanted me to go north. Why, then, did you send Tacfh<v pole Tom to me with the story of Mr. Hickok’s captivity in Mexico ?”	>
“I send Tadpole Tom to tell you that?” she said, in a tone of utter astonishment. “Why, I never knew that Tom had gone to find you until Craven Starr told me!” Buffalo Bill heard this astonishing statement with provoking calmness. Wild Bill, taking it as gospel truth, clapped his hands.
“That explains everything,” he said. “Go ahead. I’m betting on you, little girl.”
Stella Bayne gave the speaker a grateful glance. But her voice was cold when she again addressed the kin^ of scouts.
“You are not convinced, Mr. Cody,” she continued. “Then let me tell you something more. I sent out Craven Starr to find Tom and bring him back. After he had gone I became troubled over the situation. I jknew that Starr hated Tom, and I knew he hated you
THE BUFFALO BILL' STORIES.
m
because I took an interest in you. He is of a very jealous disposition.”
“Is?” repeated Buffalo Bill. “Didn't you know that lie is dead?”
“Dead!” She drew a deep breath. "I—I am no? sorry.”
“Tadpole Tom killed him,” said Wild Bill.
Now her face hardened. An ominous light gleamed m her eyes.
Buffalo Bill again found himself occupied with a puzzle.
“Tom should have minded his own business,” she snapped. “I cared nothing for Craven Starr, but Tom had no right to kill him.”
“Not when Starr had planned to kill Tom ?” said the king of scouts. “I heard Starr tell Whistling Raven that Tom must be killed. I told the dwarf what I had heard, and I reckon he felt ugly about it.”
The girl’s expression changed. She even smiled, ■yhat puts a different complexion on the matter,” she said.
Buffalo Bill looked at Wild Bill before he again spoke to the girl. His countenance was grave when he began.
“Hiss Bayne,” said he, “this is a very serious affair.
I am experiencing difficulty in getting at the truth. Your last statement tends to throw suspicion upon Tadpole Tom. In so many words you call him a liar. You say that he came to me with a cock-and-bull storv. I have been with Tom for nearly twenty-four hours. I had formed an opinion of his character before he came across the Rio Grande. That opinion was strengthened by our relationship here in Mexico. In spite of what you have said”—she flinched a little—“I refuse to believe that he is the vile bping you have pictured. You may be my friend, you may not have guilty connection with my mys-, pous enemy, but no matter how you stand, Tom is my Vriend. I am sorrv to speak to you in this way, but you must admit that you have not yet established your right to be treated otherwise.”
“Look here Cody.” spoke Wild Bill, in some heat, “ain't you going too far? Miss Bayne is a lady. She’s tangled up in a prettv bad way, and when she’s trying to untangle herself you ought to help her, instead of chucking ice at her.”
The king of scouts,-with a flicker of a smile about his lips, quietly replied : “I aim to be just, as well as generous.” Then to the girl: “Have you anything more to say?”
“Anything more?” with uplifted eyebrows. “Why, I am not half-through my explanation. It may not interest you”—she shrugged her shapely shoulders-<-‘%ut I am sure it will interest Mr. Hickok.”
“Go ahead,” said Wild Bill. “You have got one friend here.”
“She may have two,” rejoined Buffalo Bill, as he picked
up a stick and began whittling. ‘‘The .case is on trial. The verdict is in the air.”
Stella Bayne, now at her ease, resumed her explanation.
“I said that Tom-was not sent to you by me, but it may be that he was sent by Craven Starr, and that Starr told him that I wanted him to go to you with the Wild Bill story. 'And it"may be in telling you about the matter Tom may have either ignored or forgotten the part Starr played, and have stated what he believed to be the truth—that I sent him to you.”
“It may be as you say,” admitted Buffalo Bill.
“I hope that is the true explanation of his conduct/’ she went on. “But let that matter rest for the present.
I know that a short time after Craven Starr had gone in pursuit of Tom I became alarmed. I distrusted Mr. Starr. I began to fear that harm would come to Tom, as well as to you, Mr. Cody. So I saddled my pony and rode for Mexico. At Los Huecos I was fortunate in meeting Starr. He was alone. He said he had come up with Tom, and that the dwarf had not only refused to turn back, but had fired at him.”
She paused a moment, and Buffalo Bill asked: “Didn't you know that Starr took with him Whistling Raven and his braves?”
“No; the Indians had been gone from the gulch more than an hour before Starr set out. I supposed that the Raven and his braves had gone to the north, to Apache land.”
“Go on,” said the king of scouts curtly.
The girl’s eyes flashed. She was angry. She looked at Wild Bill, and, meeting sympathetic encouragement in his countenance, proceeded in a softened voice:
“I upbraided Starr for his failure, and accused him of speaking to Tom in such a way as to prevent an amicable understanding between them. Soon after this we went out to hire an escort to the Yaqui country, for I had made up my mind to find you and Tom before another day. Starr found some men, and we set out. I assure you, Mr. Cody, that I had no idea that Starr intended to use the men I had hired for any murderous purpose.”
Buffalo Bill, partly convinced, remained for a few moments in deep study. Stella Bayne looked at Wild Bill and smiled.
“There is one thing that has not been explained,” tlie king of scouts remarked. “Whose was the hand that pressed the trigger of the pistol that was aimed at Hickok’s head, and that afterward released the Indian we had taken prisoner, and who lies there dead?” “Tadpole Tom,” said Wrild Bill promptly. “It couldn't have been anybody else.”
^“What do ye say?”
, The speaker was the dwarf. He had stolen up so softly that not one of the trio had heard him.
20
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
Wild Bill was on his feet instantly. Covering the dwarf with his revolver, he said sternly: “The jig is up, you villain. Elevate your bread-hooks, or I’ll lay you alongside that Indian you let loose to kill me.”
Tadpole Tom threw up his hands. As he did so a horseman rode up and halted. When he saw Buffalo Bill he joyfully exclaimed: "Hello, Cody! what are you doing in Mexico?”
The king of scouts greeted the newcomer warmly. “That you, Martin? Haven’t seen you for an age. Where have you been keeping yourself?”
“Down Zacatecas way. But what are you up to here ? Practising a hold-up?”
Buffalo Bill, with a nod to Tadpole Tom, removed the dwarf’s weapons, and then said to Wild Bill: “Lower your gun, old man. I’ll see that he doesn’t get away.” The order was obeyed, and the king of scouts turned to the newcomer, a grizzled, honest-faced miner, and explained the situation.
“You are off your base, Mr. Hickok,” remarked the miner. “Tadpole Tom has been \vith me for over an hour. I met him several miles down the trail. He was hiking for Los Huecos, looking for a woman.”
“For me,” put in Stella Bayne, between whom and Tadpole Tom more than one glance had passed.
“Then that settles one thing,” admitted Wild Bill. “He couldn’t have released the Indian.”
“Released ther Injun,” repeated the dwarf, with a look of bewilderment. “What has happened, and what air ye suspectin’ of me?” In sorrowful reproach, his eyes sought Buffalo Bill’s face.
The king of scouts answered frankly and earnestly: “I am not suspecting you of anything. I believe you are true blue. But Miss Bayne has said things that have made Wild Bill put you on his black-list.”
“What did she say?” His voice was shaky.
The girl spoke up quickly: “I never.accused you of anything. 1 only said that I never sent you after Mr. Cody. I suppose Craven Starr told you that I wanted you to go.”
“Yes, yes,” he said, “that war ther way of it.”
He took out his bandanna and wiped his face, though he was not perspiring.
“Are you satisfied ?” asked the girl. There was a tinge of malice in her tone.
Buffalo Bill smiled. “Yes, I am satisfied,” he said. Martin, the miner, was in a hurry, and soon took his leave. He was on his way to sojne mines bordering the .Yaqui country.
After he had gone, Tadpole Tom became gloomily silent. In marked contrast to his attitude was that of the girl. She was all smiles, and seemed not to have a care 011 her mind.
Without being asked for an opinion, she paid she be-
lieved that the shot fired at Wild Bill after the fight on the mesa came from a pistol in the hands of Craven Starr. “He was lying near one of the Mexicans who had been killed,” she said, “and he probably saw the dead man’s revolver lying 011 the ground within reach, and, taking it up, fired at the man nearest to him. That man was Mr. Hickok. As for the Indian that I killed, I believe he liberated himself.” She went to the tree about which the Apache had been bound, and, picking up the cords, came bftck with them- “Yes,” she asserted, “that was the way of it. The cords are not cut. They are untied. Now, if a friend had come to his assistance, a knife would have been used, as a matter of course.”
She answered a question in Wild Bill’s eyes, saying: “I think I can explain why the Mexican on the ground there wanted to kill you. In the fight on the mesa you shot and killed the leader of the men I hired in Los Huecos. He was probably a close friend of the Mexican who escaped death. When this Mexican freed himself from his bonds, the sole thought was to kill you^ Isn’t that explanation plausible?”
“Sure, ’ said Wild Bill, looking at her in admiration.
What s your opinion ?” asked the king of scouts, with his eyes on Tadpole Tom.
“My opinionr” He .seemed dazed. “I—I haven’t any.”
“Here is the whole business in a nutshell,” said Wild Bill confidently. “Buffalo Bill’s enemy was Craven Starr. His only confederates were the Indians and the outlaw's. They are all dead. And now what? We will go 011 to Los Huecos, leave Miss Bayne and Tom there, and then you and I, Cody, will proceed to the Yaqui country and scheme out some way to rescue mv cousin.” “That program suits me,” responded Buffalo Bill. Tadpole Tom made no objection. Neither did Stella Bayne.	/	g
That night the four rested in Los Huecos, and the" next morning the two scouts parted with Tadpole Tom and his mistress. The dwarf’s face was sad, and when he shook hands with Buffalo Bill he said: “I dunno what ther future’s got fer either of us,- but I’m ahopin ter meet ye ag'in. I like ye, an’ I want ye ter keep 011 a thinkin’ well of me.”
“You can bet on that,” w'as the cordial response. “I know a white man when I see one,”
Stella Ba3'ne, in the best of spirits, invited the scouts to visit the gulch 011 their return to Arizona. “We t»h«H' stay there a month or more,” she said. “It is the wrong time of the year to return to New Orleans. Besides, 1 like the solitude. Queer, isn’t itr’’
“Jt’s a queer world,” returned Buffalo Bill.
The scouts met with no adventures 011 their way to the bridge of vines. By hard riding they made the jouincy in one day, and camped some distance fiom the tiail. About midnight Buffalo Bill, who was wide awake,
heard the sound of horse's hooTs. Some one was galloping along^the trail, going not in the direction of Los Huccos, but toward the Yaqui country. He listened for an hour, but heard no other sounds.
In the morning he mentioned the occurrence to Wild
Hill.
“Some traveler, probably ” said the tall scout. “This trail is used every day.”
“True, Hickok; but very few people travel in the night-time,”
"No reason why they shouldn’t, if they want to.” Buffalo Bill did not pursue the subject, but his expression was serious as he moved about preparing
breakfast.
Late in the afternoon the scouts were high up on one °f the loftiest mountains of the Sierra Madre range. "I he trail ran perilously close to a rocky precipice. Looking over it, one could see, a thousand feet below, a turbulent branch of the Yaqui River. The descent for more tb half the way was almost vertical.
*\rwas near this precipice, in a sheltered nook among lhc rocks and in the shade of two immense magueys, which grow on the highlands as well as on the low-Jands of Mexico, that the king of scouts and Wild Bill ' concluded to rest for the night. There was snow on the Peaks above them, and the air was cool and bracing. Having filled their canteens before beginning the ascent of the mountain, they had no need to seek for a Place convenient to water.
Although they were many miles from the habitations °f the Yaquis, and were, therefore, not apprehensive of danger, they kept alternate watch during the night.
Buffalo Bill had the late watch. It was close upon daylight, and he was thoughtfully pacing up and down the small space within the rocky enclosure, when sus-pi/ is noises outside were heard.
roused Wild Bill, and, in a whisper, said: “It looks as if we were in for it. There are people moving •ill about us."
They grasped their rifles, and, lying down behind the rocivs, waited for what was to come.
Suddenly the great branches of one of the magueys began to shake. Looking up, Buffalo Bill thought he could discern a dark figure clinging to the body of the tree.	,
lie was debating whether or not to fire, when a heavy stone struck him in the chest. The next instant Wild Bill fired, and a chorus of savage yells answered the shot.
What happened during the ensuing five minutes was of the most exciting description. Two-score of Yaqtiis bounded over the rocks and engaged in a hand-to-hand fight wrilh Buffalo Bill and his intrepid partner. No shois were fired by the Indians, but with knives and clubs they assailed the dauntless* pair, and at last, by sheer force of numbers, gained the victoiy.
But it was a dearly bought one. Six of the attacking party lay dead in the enclosure, and three others were badly wounded. Buffalo Bill had struggled to his feet as the Yaquis came pouring in, and had pistoled two before his weapon was knocked from his hand by a club wielded by a powerful Yaqui. Then he was forced to use his knife, and, had he not been assailed on all sides, might have beaten back his adversaries. He wondered, as the unequal conflict progressed, why no attempt was made to take his life. The Indians did not spare their knives, it is 'true, but the wounds they inflicted were not seriqus ones.
As for Wild Bill, he fought with his old-time courage. After sending three of his enemies to their last account, he was brought to the ground by a series of hard blows upon the back of,his head.
Daylight found the two scouts with clear minds, but
with aching bodies.
\
They had been bound hand and foot. Wrild Bill had been left in the enclosure among the dead and wounded, but Buffalo Bill had been brought out of the enclosure to a narrow shelf overlooking the precipice-
For half an hour the Indians were engaged in twisting and knotting vines which they had Brought with them to the mountain.
What their purpose was the king of scouts was soon to know.
After a heavy, twisted rope over sixty feet in length had been made, two of the Indians approached Buffalo Bill and began to wind one end of the rope about his body. The last few' windings were under his arms, and the knot was at the back.
“What are you going to do with me?” he asked, in Spanish.
One who appeared to be the chief answered: “What has been commanded.”
“And what is that?”
"Buffalo Bill will become bait for the vultures.” The Indian pointed to a deep gulf beyond the shelf.
The king of scouts understood. Brave as he was, he could not repress a shudder. All was plain to him. He was'in the power of his mysterious enemy.
' He asked no more questions, but closed his eyes and tried to still the awful feeling that was creeping over him.
His eyes did not open as the Indian lowered him over the gulf. At^last their work was ended and Buffalo Bill, suspended in the air over fifty feet from the top of the precipice, his arms bound to his sides, and with stout vines over the cords, realized that he was nearer death than he had ever been before.
And such a death! His brain reeled as he pictured it. It would come by inches, and his sufferings would be terrible while life lasted.
The hot sun would beat upon his head, the agony of thirst would assail him, and in his final moments the vultures would begin their awful work.
He opened his eyes and found that he faced the rocky wall of the precipice. He was glad of this, though he smiled bitterly the next moment at the idea of deriving any consolation from the frightful position in which he had been placed. He tried to swing his body so that his feet might touch the wall, but quickly discovered that he was not able to do so. A log had been pushed a couple of feet over the shelf and a groove made for the rope, which, dropping over the end of the log, descended so that Buffalo Bill’s body was distant from the frail about six feet.
The Indians remained on the brow of the precipice a short time, and then departed, taking with them as a prisoner Wild Bill.
An hour passed, and Buffalo Bill, who was becoming very uncomfortable, heard a voice calling him from above. The voice was cracked and wheezy, and resembled that of the "villain who had personated the Wizard of Windy Gulch.
The king of scouts raised his eyes, and saw bending over »the shelf an old man with long, white whiskers.
*‘At last, at last, William F. Cody, you are where I have long wanted you. This is the last degree. It will end in death."
CHAPTER VIII.
OUT OF THE JAWS OF DEATH.
The king of scouts made no reply to the Satanic speech of his enemy. It is doubtful if he could have made himself heard even if he had tried to speak. But he felt no inclination to open his mouth and talk to the fiend in human shape over his head.
“All three degrees were prepared weeks, ago,” the voice went on, “and I had more than one device for luring you to this part of Mexico. I have long known the-capabilities of this precipice. Do you know what it is called? The Gulf of Death.- Appropriate, isn't kit? ■There is a tree across the gulf. Do you see the vultures, in it? They are watching you. When you begin to wilt, they’ll fly over and pick out your eyes; pick them out while you are yet living.” The wizard gave a shrill, uncanny laugh. Buffalo Bill shivered. He was human, and the torture that had already begun pierced him to the marrow. But he made no moan, and he tried to control the muscles of his face, so that his devilish tormentor might not see that his words were having any effect
A slender cord dangled over the precipice. Attached to it was >a lighted cigar. The cigar reached Buffalo Bill, struck his face. He batted it with his head. The
wizard laughed again. “Don’t do that,’ he urgec-“Stick out your lips and grab it.”
The scout twisted and put his back to the cigar. The wizard tittered. “You bad boy,” he remonstrated. “Won’t take a good thing when it is offered to you-And you repulse my generous tender? Shame on you-Don’t you see that I am not at all bad? I want to givC you a few moments' comfort before leaving you to your fate. Oh, well, if you won't you won’t, I suppose.”
The cord with its attachment was drawn up, and then, in a harsher voice, the wizard said :
“Do you know that I hate you so bitterly that 1 d° not want you to die now ? I have got to go away, f*>r away, or I might be urged to haul you up, and tbca invent a fourth degree. If I could do it with safety> would keep you there on the string for years. I would make your life one long agony. But there is a risk i11 delaying your death. I think I’ll close accounts wit*1 the third degree.”
He arose to bis feet, and the tormented scout h<r he would go away and never come back, i
Lut the wizard was not yet through with his victin1. There were plenty of small stones on the mountain and, gathering a handful of them, the human fiend b*-gan to pelt the object of his undying hate. The aim " not true, and Buffalo Bill escaped without much u1' jury. One stone struck his breast, however, and anothL'** grazed his head.
Now he spoke, and. his voice, cracked and hoarse, jl,s* reached the wizard’s ears.	/
If I could get out of this,” he shouted,, “I would tie your case in short order.”
Oh, no, you wouldn’t,” was the cool reply. 011 dont know me. My home won’t be at Windy Gu^' any more. I would tell you who I am,' but tbatvwou)^ give you some comfort. I am determined that you sb^ get any more comfort out of this life. It will be tne other way. You will die never knowing who has hunted you down so remorselessly.”
With these words, the wizard left the precipice.
Two hours passed, and Buffalo Bill began to 'Suffer terribly. His bonds hurt him, he was all pins and needles, and the sun, beating pitilessly upon his head, threatened to drive him crazy. His throat was parched* and his head was buzzing. And there were the vultures. Thev had left the tree and were circling-above his head.
He was watching them with partly glazed eyes, when he felt a tug at the rope which held him. He looked up with heart of hope, and then gave a cry of joy. Pulling at the rope was Tadpole Tom.
The drawf heard the cry of the scout, faint as it was, and at once shouted: “Brace up, Buffler, .ye ah conun
up soon.”	y
He left the shelf, was gone a few minutes, and returned with two Mexicans. The three men were able

to do what was required, and in a short time the king °f scouts was drawn to the shelf and lifted to a place °f safety.
After his bonds had been removed, he was given a drink of water. But it was some time before he was able to walk without staggering.
What he said to Tadpole Tom caused the dwarf to blush like a schoolgirl.
“I, got here as soon as I could,” the little fellow said. Night afore last I s’picioned ye war in danger over this Way, an’ I set out ter warn ye 'thout waitin’ fer breakfast in ther morninY’
“What made you suspect I was in danger?'*—giving the dwarf a curious look.
Tadpole Tom hung his head. “I don t like ter tell ye»” he said.
“Then I’ll tell you, Tom. The lid is off now, and I °an speak. You knew that Stella Bayne had gone this Wav, and you knew, also, that she had evil designs a£\jst me. Don’t shake your head, for I know'that 'tell the Wizard of Windy Gulch. I talked with her, 0r rather she talked to me, about an hour ago. She was made up as .the wizard, but I recognized her voice and gestures. She is the enemy who invented the. several degrees of torture from which I have escaped alive, ladpole Tom began to cry. The king of scouts looked him compassionately.
After he had wiped his eyes, the dwarf said: “I can’t-tell ye that ye .lie, fer ye don’t. She is ther wizard, though I didn't know it until we got ter Los Huecos an’ were in ther room in ther adobe we d engaged fer ther night. An’ she’s somethin’ else. She’s my wife.” The two Mexicans were not within hearing. 'After freeing Buffalo Bill they had gone to the shade of a niaguey and stretched themselves out for a smoke. ^ /fore, they didn’t know what called forth the scout’s
ejaculation of amazement.	*
“Your wife?” he repeated. “I never thought of that.” “I know ye didn’t, an’ I didn't tell ye fer she wanted ter keep ther relationship secret. Ashamed of me, that’s ther reasori. I had some money, an* I married her when she was sick an’ penniless. f I knowed she didn’t keer fer me, but I wanted her, an’ I thought if I treated her right she’d come ter like me well enough arter awhile.” Buffalo Bill, knowing that there was an interesting story coming, took the dwarf by the arm and led him to the shade of the other maguey.
When they had seated themselves, he said : “Now, Tom, tell me everything you know. You can trust me. I will be just.”
“I’m goin’ ter trust ye. I have ter. Well, ther story I told ye back by ther bridge was some parts true. Hjsr father did save my life, an’ I promised ther old man to look out fer her when he’d gone. Ther best way ter do Jhat, so I figgered, war ter marry her. She was an
actress fer awhile, an’ blew in a big wad o’ money one way an’ another. I had some money, an’ when she knew she was up agin’ it, bein’ sick an’ broke, she took me fer better or wuss. Whar she found out about you an’ that half-sister.o’ hern I dunno. Anyhow, she found out, an’ made up her mind ter make ye sweat. She’s got a b’ilin’ temper, though she don’t look it, an’ as she thought ther world an’ all of that sister—she'd been an actress, too— she got hotter an’ hotter as she roominated on what ye had done. She told me last night, when I made her open up an’ spit out ther truth, that she was told that you killed Adah with yer own hand, an’ she wouldn’t believe me when I told her different. She said you war a liar, an’ she could prove it.
“But Fm gettin’ ahead of my story. We left N' Orleans ter come ter Arizony ter find an’ hev a reckonin' with Buffler Bill. She said thar war ter be no killin’; but she meant ter make ye suffer a bit, besides forcin’ ye ter fork over ther gems ye stole from Adah. I was glad ter come along, fer I aimed ter keep her straight on that promise of hern. No killin’ in mine. At El Paso we met Starr, a planter’s son, who had been an actor, an’ arterward a gambler. I never liked ther cuss, an’ I knew he didn’t like me. He’d been sweet on Stella, but she wouldn’t marry him because he hadn’t any money. He wanted ter come along, an’ arter he an’ Stella had had a long, secret chinnin’-match, she told me that he was cornin’ with us as her agent. He knew ther country, an’ could hurry up matters. I war a fool not ter kick, fer now I know that he wanted the chance ter git me out of ther way, so he’d have Stella all ter himself. I never knowed who war ther wizard until Stella told me in Los Huecos. I s’picioned she might be the player arter I had that talk with ye by ther bridge, but I warn't sure until she owned up.
"An’ another thing. I never thought she’d go back on her promise not ter have ye killed until arter we had that scrap on ther mesa. She sent me to find ye arter ye left Windy Gulch, an’ she gave me that yarn about Wild Bill. I know I went back on that air statement when she’d got in a hole durin’ ther talk with ye arter she'd shot ther Mexican that tried ter kill Wild Bill, but I did that ter save her.”
“I- don’t blame you, Tom,” said Buffalo Bill, as he patted the dwarf on the back. “The lie was justifiable.”
“What I did berlieve all ther time arter ye come inter ther game was that Craven Starr meant ter kill ye whether Stella liked it or not. I had faith that Stella war actin’ squar’ when she sent me out ter stake my mustang fer ye.”
“Why did she do that?”
“I asked when we were a-confabbin’ at Los Huecos, an’ she said if ye escaped ther rattlers she wanted ye ter ride on an’ take ther third degree.”
“Did you ask her what that was ?”

THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
“I did, an’ she wouldn’t tell me. Then I made up my mind that ye warn’t yet out o’ danger. Tlier talk at Los Huecos lasted till midnight, an’*when I woke up about four in ther mornin’ I war tied fast ter the bed an’ she war gone. I war gagged, too, an’ I war a-\vonderin’ how she done it, when I noticed a queer taste in my mouth. I had been doped. We had a drink—she went down-stairs fer it—just afore I turned in. It war strong enough ter keep me dead ter ther world while she put ther crjmps onten me, but not strong enough ter keep me asleep all night.
“I had a hard time gittin’ loose, but finally I got shet of the cords, an’ then I found a horse an’ rode fer keeps. This forenoon I met ther two Mexicans and hired ’em ter come along with me. They’ve been rurales, an’ air pretty decent fellows. As soon as I saw ther log an’ ther rope of vines I got wise to ther game.”
“What made you tell me that Stella had promised to marry Starr?”
“I had ter say somethin’, bein’ as I couldn’t tell ther truth,” the dwarf answered. “I war in a tangled slti-wation when I told that lie. I war hopin’ that Stella would pan out all right, an’ so it didn’t matter much what I said, s’long’s I went easy with her. Thar, Buf-fler, ye have ther hull story. I have lied tq'ye some, but I have allers been yer friend.”
“Your lies,” returned Buffalo Bill, with a smile, “have not hurt any one. As for your dee^s, put it there, my boy. I am proud to have you as a friend.”
“I’ll be glad when Wild Bill comes round to your way o’ thinkin',” said the dwarf. “He’s got a notion in his head about me, an’ it’s wrong. My wife hippener-sized him.”
'“He surely was attracted, Tom. But Hickok is all right. All right, as regards justice to you,” he added, “but he. may not be all right in a personal sense.' He is a prisoner among the Yaquis. You and I must get him out of their hands if we can, and we must not lose any time about it, either.”
The king of scouts was on his feet, and there was grim determination in his expression.
’“Don’t be in a rush, Buffier,” said Tadpole Tom quietly. “Yer friend is in no danger. Stella will pro-tect him. She has saved his life once an’ she kin do it ag’in, ’specially when she is runnin’ ther game.”
“You think she likes Hickok, do you?”
“1 knsws it. She told me he was a bird and that she’d like ter cage him an’ make a pet of him. When she shot at him she hadn’t had a good look at him.”
“I didn’t ask you to tell me who fired that shot at Wild Bill, because it was not necessary.. But what changed her mind about him? I suppose she fired the shot to get him out of the way because he was with me, and in handling me she wanted no interference.” “That’s right, Buffler. She spied.on you and Wild Bill
after you two left ther mesa and went'down ther trail ter wait fer me. She heard what you both said, and she got stuck on Wild Bill. In course, she freed ther Mexican, but she had no idee that he Would make a sneak an’ try ter stick a knife in yer pardner. She was up to a new game then. She war a-aimin'*'ter git on ther soft side of Wild Bill so in case ye suspicioned her she could call on Wild Bill ter stand up fer her.”
“And he did stand up fer her, Tom. Her beauty and her eloquence broke down his guard. But where is he ? Can you make a guess?”
“Not ten miles from hyer. He’s a prisoner, in course, but he’ll be let loose as soon as Stella’s sartin that ye air a dead one. Now my idee is ter stay right hyer an’ wait fer Stella ter come back. When she does I’ll take keer of her, an’ then we’ll look up Wild Bill.” “You’ll take care of her? What do you intend to do?”
The dwarf shut his lip^ tightly. He had the same look in his eyes when he shot Craven Starr. Buffalo^'! frowned.	-
“I don’t like the expression of your face,” he said. “Do ye want me ter meet her,, with open arms ?” the dwarf vehemently replied. “Am I a dog ter stand what. I have stood? Not on yer life. I’m done with her, ’cept so far as dealin’ jedgment. She’s lied ter me, she’s done murder an’ wuss, she’s plottin’ ter git rid o’ me now,-an’ she’s killed every spark of affection I ever felt fer her. Ye leave her ter me. I’m her jedge. I’m ther hombre she’s got ter settle with.”
He was in a fury when he ceased speaking. The king of scouts looked at him sadly. /
“You ought to remember, that she is a woman,” he said.
The dwarf was about to make a sharp reply when two horsemen rode up the trail from the west.
One of them %was Wild Bill.
CHAPTER IX
THE GULF OF DEATH.
The king of scouts, followed by Tadpole Tom, left’ the shelter of the maguey and rushed out to meet the riders.
Wild Bill’s countenance shone with joy when he saw his old comrade. “I was afraid you had gone under,-Cody,” he said. Then he looked at the dwarf. “I reckon you had a finger in getting my pard "out of his scrape. That being so and several other things being so, it's up to me to tender an apology. I didn’t size you up right yesterday, Torn. Must have had sand in my eyes. I have got a cinch on the situation now, and I want to say that you are a thoroughbred.”
Tadpole Tom’s ugly face beaded with pleasure. ITe put out his hand, and Wild Bill took it in a grasp that left no doubt of his earnestness and sincerity.
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
25
The tall scout’s companion, a short, thick-set American with a prepossessing countenance, was now introduced.
“This gentleman,'* said Wild Bill, “is my cousin, John Davie. I have spoken of him before. He escaped awhile ago from the Yaquis?'
“Same time you escaped?” asked Buffalo Bill.
“No. Let’s go over to the shade and I’ll unload my budget.” The horsemen dismounted, and, when all four were seated under the maguey, Wild Bill said: “Before I start in I want to know what happened to you, Cody, after the Indians took me away.”
The tale was told. Wild Bill showed no surprise at the revelation of the wickedness of the woman whose cause he had championed the day before.
* “She told me enough to give me an idea*of what she'd dished up for you,” he said. “I want to kick myself when I think how she pulled the wool over my eyes.” “Wliar is she now,” questioned Tadpole Tom, quickly arpsarshly.	/
S/fld Bill gave the dwarf a disapproving look and then curtly replied: “I don’t know.”
“Go on with your story,” said Buffalo Bill/ at the time shaking his head at'Tadpole Tom.
“It’s not long and it’s not very exciting. I was taken to an Indian camp about a dozen miles from here. When we had £one half the distance an old man shot out of a thicket and commanded my captors to halt and put me down. There were seven Indians with me, and they obeyed the command without a murmur. That showed that the old man was the boss.
“As I rested on the ground with my wrists and ankles tied, the old man came up and sat down by my side. ‘You are an interesting old .party,’ says I. ‘What may your game be ?’
nian ^auslie(^» an<^ it was the laugh of a
wcfoian.
“ ‘Holy smoke!’ says I, my eyes almost starting out my head. ‘You ain’t h man, then?’
“ ‘Not if I know myself,’ was the reply. ‘I am Stella Bayne/
Even then I did not suspect her of having a hand in the doings that laid you and me out, Cody. But her next words made the scales drop from my eyes. ^
,V‘ ‘I hate Buffalo Bill/ she said, ‘but I like you. I hope you won’t cease to be my friend now that I have told you this?’ Her eyes—they are dern pretty ones, Cody, were glued to mine as she spoke, and her voice was soft and appealing. Of course, I couldn’t do otherwise than tell her that Buffalo Bill could go to the devil, and that she was the entrancing personality to tie to.” The king of scouts winked at John Davie. Tadpole Tom gazed at the ground and rubbed his hands nervously.
“No, ’ continued Wild Bill, with a grin, “I was fool
enough to call her down. I told her that she was a devil and that she might go to—Beelzehub, where she belonged, before I would take a centavo’s worth of stock in her or her schemes.
“She got mighty huffy at my words—I said more, but I won’t repeat all I said—and all the devil in her popped out. She admitted that she had fooled me and that she was the enemy that had been pursuing you, Cody. ‘And/ she hissed, ‘you’ll never see your friend again. By this time to-morrow he will be food for the vultures.’
“Having relieved herself she sat for awhile with her chin between her hands. About that time I did a little responsible thinking. I sure would have no chance to ( help you, Cody, if I kept up my high-horse attitude. I determined to play fox. Pretty soon I sighed, and when she turned her eyes on me I gave her a* look that made her blush with joy. How she came to get soft on me is more than I can tell. But she was, and when I apologized for speaking roughly to her and promised to be good in future and take her and anything else that might be coming to me, she—what do you think she did? She threw her arms about my neck and kissed me.”
Tadpole Tom flinched and gritted his teeth.
Wild Bill gave the dwarf a queer look, and then went on with his story. “After she kissed me she spoke to the Indian who was bossing the party, and pretty soon I was taken up and we moved on. Stella Bayne did not go with us. She stayed behind, and her last words to me were: “You will be treated well, and I will come and release you to-morrow.”
“So ye owe yer freedom ter her, do ye?” hoarsely inquired Tadpole Tom.
“No, I don’t. I owe it to my own ingenuity. The Indians took me. td the camp, and, after I had been put under cover in a shack made of vines, the boss Indian loosened my bonds. But he didn't take away the guards. There were four of them, and two stayed in the shack with me. I had been wounded in the scuffle in that rock pen beyond us, and the Indians dressed the wounds, cuts mostly, and none of them deep ones, and* then gave me something to eat.
“Before I went into the Yaqui country to look for John here, I had picked up a smattering of the language. While the Indians were feeding me I used my knowledge in telling them that I was going to marry the woman who had appeared 011 the trail as the old man. I lauded her to the skies and said if I had known three hours before what I did then I would never have backed up Buffalo Bill.
“Such talk wouldn’t have gone with an Apache, hut these Yaquis are unsophisticated redskins, and I fooled ’em to the limit. It wasn’t long before my hands were free and I was sitting up smoking the pipe of peace with my two guards. The one nearest to me had a knife

THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
in his belt—he had on a cowboy suit—and, watching my chance, I snatched it, cut the leathers about my ankles, and had the Indian stretched on the floor from a whack on the head before he could say ‘Jad* Robinson.’
“The other Indian was near the door looking out, and he wasn’t onto my game until he heard the other Indian fall. Then we had it for about half a m>nute. Of course, we made a noise, and the two Indians outside heard it and came rushing in.
“As they got inside I was through with my man and had a stone bowl in my hand. I had been eating olla podrida out of it but a few minutes before. I let it go, and it struck one of the redskins in the jaw. He tumbled over, and the other dodged as I made a dash at him. I believe he fired at me, seems to me I heard a shot, but I wasn’t hurt. He was, and soon I was outside the shack and on a pony. Up the trail a mile I‘ met Davie, who had managed to escape the night before from the village. It is but a few miles from the camp to which I had been taken. He had swiped a pony, and we rode up here as fast as we could.”
“As you didn’t meet Stella Bayne on the way,” said Buffalo Bill, “I must conclude that she went toward the east after leaving the shelf a little over an hour ago.” ‘ “You have struck it, I reckon,” responded Wild Bill, “and as we can’t be seen from the trail, we might as well stay where we are and wait for her.”
“I am not going to stay,” announced Tadpole Tom, in savage determination. “I am going down ter meet her.” “No, you are not,” returned Buffalo Bill sharply. “Be reasonable. She has committed many crimes and should be punished. We will arrest her and let the law take its course.”
“Mexican law. Bosh,” sneered the dwarf. “Why, she’d hippenersize her jailers inside o’ t^venty-four hours. No, Buffler, let me be ther law. Be reasonable yerself.” John Davie, who had been looking toward the trail, turned quickly at Tadpole Tom’s last words and said: “Some one is coming.”
Buffalo Bill, after giving Wild Bill a meaning look, crawled forward so as to get a full view of the trail.
He could hear the sound of hoofs, and presently there rode from the east toward the shelf overlooking the gulf the Wizard of Windy Gulch.
Still disguised as the old man, the wicked woman came on until her«eyes took in the evidence of the escape of Buffalo Bill.
The log, which had projected over the shelf, had been drawn away, and there near the shelf were the ropes of vines that had held the victim of her hellish hate.
She reined up her pony and looked about her, an expression of wild terror on her face.
A voice startled her. It was that of Tadpole Tom, her husband. “Let me go,” it said. The dwarf was struggling in the grasp of Wild Bill.
She knew its import, and, with a cry like that of a fright-crazed animal, turned and would have ridden away if Buffalo Bill, armed with a rifle he had taken from the hands of one of the Mexicans, had not fired. The bullet struck the pony in a vital part and the animal dropped.
Stella Bayne was on her feet as the king of scouts. John Davie, and the Mexicans rushed to the trail.
Disregarding the command to stay where she was, she fired a pistol-shot at Buffalo Bill and then sprang into the brush.
The king of scouts, who had dodged the bullet, gave a few hurried instructions to Davie and the Mexicans, and then ran for the spot that marked the point of the woman’s disappearance/
The Mexicans ran down the trail along which the woman had come, while Davie hurried past the magueys to parall§l the course that Buffalo Bill had probably taken.
After the four men had gone Wild Bill released his grip on Tadpole Tom. “I reckon you can’t make a0)}}$ of this business now, my boy,” he said shortly. “Buniio Bill will get her, and, as your guns are in my possession, there won’t be any chance for you to cut up any nasty capers.”
A scream in the bushes not far from where Wild Bill and Tadpole Tom sat brought the two men to their feet.
Wild Bill rushed out, and, finding the trail clear, turned and ran into the brush.
Tadpole remained by the maguey.
A few minutes passed and his quick ear caught the' sound of a movement in a thicket beyond the rocky enclosure that had been the scene of the fight between Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill, and the Yaquis.
He flattened himself on the ground and waited, a demoniac smile on his ugly face.
There was silence for a short time, and then folv -d a rustling of branches and the sigh of a human being.
Just then Buffalo Bill stepped into the trail at a.poiat not twenty feet from the spot where Tadpole Tom lay-The dwarf saw him, and crawling forward a few paces, partly raised himself, and, catching Buffalo Bill’s eye, pointed to the west.
The king of scouts nodded his head and started on a run along the trail which led to the Yaqui country.
The dwarf suppressed a cljuckle and drew back to cover.
A‘minute later Stella Bayne, breathing heavily, her cheeks flushed, and with the look of a hunted deer in her eyes, stepped into the rocky enclosure.
Tadpole Tom heard the sound of her short, labored breathing, crawled past the maguey and showed his head over one of the rocks that formed the enclosure. "I he woman saw him, and would have shrieked if he had not placed a finger upon his lips.
THE BUFFALO BILL STORIES.
27
Terror now gave way to wonderment. She stood stock-still and waited for him to speak.
He held up his hands. “I am unarmed. Give me your pistol,” he whispered.
She hesitated. She could make nothing out of the expression of his face.
“Come,” he commanded. ‘‘Time is precious. If I am ter save ye, I must be quick about it.”
“You won’t hurt me?” slie.falteringly asked.
“I will do what is right by you. I have allers done that, haven’t I?”
This was not the answer she wanted. Her suspicions Were aroused. She turned as if she intended to take to the brush again.
As she did so Tadpole Tom leaped over the rock and seized her arm before she could use the revolver.
“You fool!” he hissed. “Don’t ye know that I am boss. Ye’re my wrfe, ain’t ye ?”
“Yes,” she tremblingly answered, for he was holding h<f'" -mis in a vise. She knew, their power, and knew alL ^iat he meant her harm she w'ould be powerless to defend herself.
j-Ier mind oppressed by horrible doubts, she pleaded with him.
“You don’t mean to kill me, do you, Tom ? I will not bother Buffalo Bill any more if you will promise to let me live. You will, won’t you?”
For answer the dwarf dragged her out of the enclosure.
A look of fierce satisfaction shone in his eyes as he saw that the trail was deserted. All the members of his party were still in the brush on a wild-goose chase.'
He dragged h^r to tli£ trail.
“What are you going to do ?” she shrieked, and tried to fight herself loose from his grasp. As well might she h^'^tried to release herself from the grasp of a giant.
Axe took her in his arms, and, holding her slight body against his breast with a force that drove away all her breath, hurried to the brow of the precipice.
Divining his awful intention, she screamed with all the force she could muster. The shriek she had uttered shortly before had been heard by the searchers, and when she again opened her mouth to voice her terror and despair, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill, John Davie, and the two pAlexicans came running- from different directions for the trail.
The dwarf, with his screaming burden, was near the chasm. One last, piteous appeal the wicked woman made.
“Tom,” she cried, her bloodshot eyes trying to hold his attention, “you loved me once. You told my father you would look out for me. Tom,” as he refused to look into her face, “I—I can’t die as I am.”
“Yer cant.” he yelled in her ear. “Well, ye’ve got ter. Ye say I loved ye once. So I did. An’ I love ye
now. I love ye so well that I’m goin’ ter stop ye from doin’ any more devil’s work.”
. He stood on the edge of the precipice. Below yawned the Gulf of Death. A shout from behind him made him turn his head.
“Tom!” shouted Buffalo Biil. “Come back here. Are you crazy?”
The king* of scouts would have taken desperate measures to save the woman—he would have used his rifle N—but the opportunity was denied him. But as he spoke he rushed forward. Wild Bill followed close behind.
Buffalo Bill’s words had no effect. Tadpole Tom tore the woman’s arms from his body—she had clutched him frantically by the shoulders—and, lifting her above his head, flung her down the gulf.
One shriek burst from her lips, and then all was still.
Facing the two scouts who were now within a few feet of him, the dwarf took off his sombrero and made a low bow. His eyes were rolling wildly, and foam was dripping from his thick lips.
“Down! down! in ther gulch, whar we’ll be ter-gether,” he shouted hoarsely as he leaped over the precipice.
The horfor-stricken scouts looked at each other, but not a word was said.
They walked back to the maguey and sat down. Buffalo Bill mopped the cold perspiration from his face, sighing deeply as he did so.
“I’m sorry, sorry as can be,” he said.
“For the woman?”
“No, for Tadpole Tom. He would have been a fine fellow if he had had a chance. That woman drove him insane. He was as crazy as a bedbug when he threw her over the precipice.”
“You are right, and I reckon the Lord will deal gently with him.”
But a short stay was made on the mountain. In Los Huecos the three Americans parted with the Mexicans. The latter' sold their rifles and revolvers to the two scouts, and now fully armed Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill with John Davie as companion rode out of Mexico into Arizona.
For a part of the journey from the Gulf of Death to Los Huecos the king of scouts rode behind Wild Bill, but near the scene of the fight with the Mexican outlaws he came upon a stray pony, one that had been ridden by Shanky Simpson. This animal Buffalo Bill appropriated and it proved to be as serviceable as the one he had lost.
1A stop was made at Windy Gulch.
In Tadpole Tom’s cave were found letters and documents of value. These, with the dwarf’s personal effects, wetfe forwarded to the address of an attorney in New Orleans. The address had been found on the outside of
an envelope. The letter which the envelope enclosed related to business. It stated among other things that Thomas Harryman’s one-hundred-thousand dollar investment in certain railway securities was paying an increased rate of interest.
In the larger cave no letters or papers of importance were discovered. The personal belongings of Stella Harryman were not disturbed.
There was one thing more to be done, and Buffalo Bill took a fierce pleasure in having it done. This was the destruction of the rattlesnakes in the den overlooking the canon. A large fire was built over the den, and when the logs were blazing they were shoved down upon the rattlers. Below, at the foot of the cliff that Buffalo Bill had so precipitately descended, stood Wild Bill and John Davie, and, as the snakes not killed by the flames came tumbling down the cliff, they were met by the two cousins and quickly despatched.
Buffalo Bill from above took care that not a live rattler remained in the den.
This work done, the journey to Fort Winthrop was resumed.
Arrived there, Buffalo Bill had a most satisfactory report to make.
Whistling Raven’s gang had been wiped out, and Shanky Simpson, long an eyesore in southern Arizona, had met his deserts. .
Wild Bill and Davie had business in Colorado, ^nd they parted with the king of scouts after a couple of days’ stay at the fort.
As the tall scout shook hands with his old comrade and said good-by, he began to shake his head.
‘“What’s the matter, Hickok?” inquired Buffalo Bill. “Our parting will be but a short one. I am going into Colorado myself next month.”
“I wasn’t thinking of you, Cody,” was the reply. “That woman came suddenly into my mind.
“What if she did ? Why should you shake your head ?”
“She kissed me. I wish she hadn’t.*”
THE END.
