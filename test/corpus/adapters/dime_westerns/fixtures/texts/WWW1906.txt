YOUNG WILD WEST BEATING THE BOOMERS
OR,
How Arietta Exposed a Fraud
By AN OLD SCOUT
CHAPTER I.
DIZZY WEALTH CAMP.
“Here comes ther stagecoach!”
The cry rang out in a loud, shrill voice, and the small, weazen-faced man who gave vent to it seemed to be delighted.
He was standing before the open door of a long shanty that looked as though it had been built very recently, for the boards were new and bright.
The confused murmur of voices and the jingling of glasses inside the building ceased as if by magic, and then out came a dozen or more rough-looking men.
It was near the close of a bright spring day, a few years ago, when mining camps in the region known as the Wild West were not so plentiful as they are now.
Dizzy Wealth was the name that some enthusiastic miner had given to the brand-new camp and in two weeks’ time the place had grown to a population of sixty-seven.
The rapid growth was due to a party of ten men of ;i speculative turn of inind, who called themselves “Boomers.”
The man who had named the camp did not belong to the party, but it was from him that the Boomers got the idea of rushing things in the new camp.
Jack 'Marshall had found a nice little pocket, and when he went over to Bed Gulch, thirty-five miles distant., and told about it. he declared that his sudden wealth made him dizzy.
“Dizzy Wealth is tlier name of my camp, boys/’ lie
added. “Give us all a hooker of real old tanglefoot! Wealth was made ter spend, an’ if yer .drink enough tanglefoot you’ll git mighty dizzy, too. Whoopee!”
>‘o much for the naming of the little mining camp.
An enterprising individual named Hickey had guaranteed to run three trips a week from Red Uulch as soon as there was a guaranteed population of twenty-live there.
The Boomers had come over at once, and, being imbued with the ideas of money-making, they had each staked out a claim and then sent out reports that Dizzy Wealth was the richest in gold dust of any camp in Southwestern Colorado.
The result was that the camp contained a flourishing saloon and a general store at the time of which our story opens.
The weazon-faced man was one of the Boomers, and he had stationed himself outside the saloon to watch for the stagecoach, which, according to the reports they had heard, was due about sunset.
As the crowd rushed out to welcome its arrival, Bill Spencer, the leader of the Boomers, threw up his hat and yelled:
“Three cheers fur ther stagecoach, boys! It’s bringin’ a crowd! Now, then, all together!”
The men did their best ami their voices cchocd through the gulch in which the camp located, the shrill voice of Croker, the weazcn-faced man, sounding above all the rest.
If the stagecoach had never appeared in Dizzy Wealth before, it' certainly had done long and faithful service in other parts, for it was in a rather dilapidated condition and almost entirely devoid of paint.
YOUNG WILD WEST BEATING THE BOOMEIiS.
With four good-looking horses, wearing harness that looked to be quite new, it looked to be even worse than it really was.
But the looks did not count for much; the rur.ning-gear was good and strong and that made it lit for use on the rough mountain trail.
With a flourish of his long-lashed whip, the driver uttered a cheery “Hello!” and pulled in close to the saloon.
“Whoa !” he called, and then he put on the brake and the vehicle came to a stop.
Half a dozen passengers quickly got out, while the two who were riding on top with the baggage slid down and made for the bar of the saloon.
Of the eight passengers, all told, seven of them looked to be men who had roughed it under all sorts of conditions.
The remaining one had more of a refined look about him, and wore what the miners called “store-clothes.”
He seemed to feel rather strange, for he looked at the crowd gathered in front of the shanty saloon as though he hoped to find someone he could unbosom himself to.
Bill Spencer picked him out right away, and, stepping out to him. put out his hand.
“Welcome ter Dizzy Wealth, stranger!” he exclaimed. "This are ther greatest millin' camp in ther West, an’ it's only two weeks old! Yer couldn’t have come ter n better place, if you're lookin’ fur a chance ter make money.”
The face of the tenderfoot, for such he was, lighted up as he took the Boomer’s hand.
“Well, I'll admit that I did come here to try and make money, my friend,” lie answered. “I have only been in the West. a week, and by chance I struck Ked Gulch yesterday. There I heard about how gold was being found so abundantly here in Dizzy Wealth, and I made up my mind to come over and see what there was in it. Being a stranger in these parts, 1 am, of course, rather green.”
“Oh, you're all right, stranger. You'll make a big hit by cornin' here, I’m sure. I'm Bill Spencer, an* I’m one of ther lucky ones. I've struck it rich here, an’ J. want everybody else ter do it. What's your handle?”
‘‘My mime is Esmond Dailey.”
“Glad ter know yer, Mister Dailey, i'll jest shake ag'in with yer fur good acquaintance sake.”
The tenderfoot seemed to be much pleased with the reception he had got so far at Dizzy Wealth camp.
Ite started in to tell Bill Spencer how he had invested some money a year before in Colorado mining stocks, and that he had succeeded beyond his expectation*.
This success had made him take the notion to com,, out on lhc grounds and invest more money.
Spencer led him along nicely, declaring that lu* iVa§ 0np of thi* shrewdest men ho had over met, and the tenderf + swi lled up wiih pride.	*
WJrd' thcv v ere talking a picturcsqur- parlv of i f.nuo d1: liihu up.	‘ r,< ''rf;
There was something about them that attracted the attention of both Spencer and the man from the East.
They were the only ones remaining in front of the shanty saloon, the rest having gone inside to refresh themselves.
The leader of the Boomers had been left to take care of the tenderfoot by his partners, for they knew Spencer knew his business better than any of them.
“There is something very dashing about that boy and girl in the lead,” said Esmpnd Dailey, as he looked at the approaching strangers with admiring eyes. “I wonder who they can be.”
“That’s more’n I know,” answered Spencer, shrugging his shoulders. “That tall galoot with ther long black hair an’ mustache looks as though he’s an old-time Westerner all right. • Ther two boys does, too, fur that matter, but they’re got up a little more fancy than we're in ther habit of seein’ around these parts. A young woman an’ two gals with’ em, too! An* two heathen Chinee! Well, this are a treat ter Dizzy Wealth, an’ no mistake!”
The party rode right up before the saloon before they halted.
“What camp is this, friends?” asked the dashing-look-ing boy, who, with a very pretty young girl, had led the party in, as he looked at Spencer and the tenderfoot.
“Dizzy Wealth is ther name of it, young feller,” answered" the leader of the Boomers, promptly, “an’ it’* ther boss fninin’ camp of Colorado, too! An’ only a couple of weeks old. Everybody is strikin’ it rich here.”
“Is that so?” and the boy brushed back his long chestnut hair, which hung to his shoulders, and looked at the man curiously.
“It sartinly are so; ain’t.it, pard?”
“Well, I—I don't‘just know yet. You see, I have just got here,” said Esmond Dailey, looking a bit confused at having the question put to him that way. “I heard the very best of reports from the camp, though, and that ig why 1 came here.”
The rest of the new arrivals looked interested, but none of them had anything to say just then.
“Come here ter try fur a fortune, 1 reckon?” queried Spencer, after a pause.
“No,”replied the boy, “we just struck here by accident-We didn t know there was a mining camp here at all* guess we’ll stay here overnight, though, and in the ing wc 11 look over the ground, Wc are always reatly speculate, you know.”
“Good! You’re jest like me. What i« y«“r young feller, if yer don’t mind tellin’?”
“Young Wild West.”
Esmond Dailey gave a start.	1(Jk

YOUNG WILD WEST BEATING THE BOOMERS.
“I have heard considerable about you, and I must say that 1 am more than glad to meet you.”
The boy now dismounted.
“You appear to be a stranger around here,” lie said.
“I am. I have just come on from the East. My home is in New Haven, Connecticut. I read about you in a Denver paper a couple oi' days ago. It was in connection with an Indian outbreak of some kind.”
“Oh, they are liable to print anything in a newspaper. Maybe it was not all true that you read.”
“ Well, it was enough to make me feel • like getting acquainted with you. 1 shall consider it an honor to be allowed to shake hands with you.”
Young Wild West smiled and put out his hand.
It was at this juncture that three or four of the Boomers came out.
Evidently they thought their leader had fixed tilings with the tenderfoot by this time.
So absorbed had they been, and so noisy was the crowd inside, that they had not heard the party ride up.
The men were astonished, to see the newcomers, especially the girls.
But there was enough chivalry about them to cause them to take off their hats and give a cheer.
“That's all right, boys,” said Young Wild West, smiling at them. “1 reckon you are not in the habit of seeing females out here. But we are in the habit of going anywhere; we don’t mind the rough part of it, you know.” One of the Boomers was seen whispering something to Bill Spencer just then, and the strangers could not help noticing it.
Spencer nodded in the affirmative, and then it was that the fellow who had done the whispering put on an air of importance and exclaimed:
“Boys, I reckon that boy with ther long hair is what some fool galoots calls ther champion deadshot of ther West. I jest found out from Bill that he calls himself Young Wild West, an5 if that is right he's ther so-called champion. S'pose we find out whether he is or not?”
This rather unexpected remark caused everybody to look at the dashing young fellow, who was standing near the head of the sorrel stallion lie had dismounted from, and who appeared to be perfectly at his ease.
“Gentlemen, I am the identical chap the big galoot speaks of,” said Young Wild West, coolly, addressing everybody but the man who had spoken. “I can’t help it if I have been nicknamed the Champion Deadshot of the West any more than he can keep from meddling with things that don’t concern him. I can see at a glance that lie is nothing but a big bluffer, and that he is always looking for a chance to make excitement. He has proposed to find out whether I am the champion deadshot or not, so I am ready to defend the title.”
There was such a business-like way about the boy that ihe majority of the crowd nodded their approval and looked admiringly at his athletic, manly form with undisguised admiration.
Right here we will state that Young Wild West was no,, only a boy who was strong, athletic and courageous to the very last degree, but a handsome and dashing one as well.
He was really the greatest of all the heroes of the Wild West at the time of which we write.
Fearless, brave unto recklessness and always ready to stand up for the right and do a good turn for the benefit of honest humanity, he had made a name for himself that many old enough to be his grandfather had never been able to attain.
And yet he was but a mere boy, though a man grown, and a man in every other sense of the word.
. The other boy with the party was Jim Dart, another young Westerner, and the tall man was Cheyenne Charlie, the famous government scout, who had distinguished himself in the Indian wars a few years before, and who was always in readiness at this time to give his services to the government, providing it was the wish of his dashing 3'oung leader, Young Wild West, whom he regarded as the best friend he had, as well as the only adviser, save his wife, perhaps.
The scout's wife was the young woman mentioned by Bill Spencer, and her given name was Anna.
The two 3*oung girls were Arietta Murdock and Eloise Gardner, the sweethearts of Young Wild West and Jim Dart.
The two Chinamen, who had led the pack-horses belonging to the party, were brothers named Hop Wah and Wing Wah and were employed by the dashing young dead-shot and his partners as servants.
Eloise Gardner, the darker complexioned of the two girls, had been in very poor health a couple of years before the opening of this story, and a life in the open air had been recommended to her; hence the presence of the girls, as the three were called by their escorts in that wild part of the Colorado mountains.
Young Wild West had been born and reared in the Wild W est, and he had lived a life of excitement and adventure since his earliest recollection, and that was why he went traveling about the mountains and plains—he was never better satisfied than when there wa? something going on that would stir the blood and quicken the pulse.
Both he and his partners were quite well fixed, as iar as wealth. was concerned, since thev owned and were interested in several mines that paid good dividend:?: so, really they had nothing to do but to go and come wlu n they pleased.
As our hero had stated on his arrival at the new mining camp, they had dropped there by accident.
The dashing voung deadshot had seen so much of life in the mining camps that it was easy for him to pick out the good from the bad men that were to be found in those places.
lie was satisfied right now that Bill Spencer was not over-honest, and I hat the man who had uttered the challenge was an out-and-out bad man of the regular tvpe of such fellows.
YOUNG WILD WEST BEATING THE BOOMER^.
The boy never interfered with such fellows unless they < interfered with him, and as the man had opened up the game, he felt duty bound to see it through.
“If you are anything like a good shot, step out here and show what you can do,” he said, calmly. “I don’t know who you are, but if you can shoot as good as you can let your jaw run you’re a good one at it.”
"See here,” exclaimed the bad man, angrily, as he noticed that several in the crowd were smiling, “my name is Harper Hicks, an’ Tm s’posed ter be ther boss shot of this here camp. I'll show yer what I kin do; but afore I do I'm goin’ ter chastise yer fur bein’ so blamed sassy! Jest make out that you’re ther scholar an’ I’m ther teacher, an’ that you’re ther bad boy, young feller 1”
CHAPTER II.
:THE SCHOOLMASTER AXD THE UN RELY BOY.”
There was not one in the crowd who did not think that! 8'mwthintr out °f the usual order oi things was going to happen when Harper Hicks, the bad man, told Young Wild West he was going to chastise him.
No one there had ever seen the dashing young deadshot before, but there was something about his looks and man ner that told them plainly that he might prove a dangerous one to tackle.
“If you are going to chastise me, get right ini” answered the boy. a twinkle in his eyes. “Before you do it, though, 1 want to tell you that I have never yet met anyone who was able to do anything like that to me. You’re the schoolmaster and 1 am the unruly scholar; go ahead!”
He folded his arms and looked at the bad man in a way that must have been tantalizing.
Harper Hicks uttered an oath and sprang toward him, with upraised hand.
lie made a vicious slap at him, but Young Wild West stepped nimbly aside and the blow wa9 wasted.
“If you strike at me again I’ll hit you.”
That is what the bad man heard, and there was a depth of meaning to the words Whizz—whizz!
He struck out with both hands, this time with clenched fii-'tv.
Biff!
The liov struck back as quickly as he ducked the blows, and, fts1(-hin<' the rascally fellow heavily on the short ribs, j-Rnt him In Ihe ground.
A garp and a groan came from Ilicks and then he remained p.-rl'ftily still for a few seconds.
Tho Mow had hurt; there was no question about that, but hi* \vm« quick to recover, for he was a very powerful man and hardened to almost any kind of usng*\
He ?“>t upon hi* feet by a great effort and pulled a revolver.
“Drop that!”
There was a commanding ring in Young Wild West's voice, and before the villain realized it a revolver was leveled at him.
The young deadshot had pulled the weapon from the, \?
|holster in a twinkling, and the majority of those looking on were ready to declare that it was the quickest thing they had ever seen done.
“Drop it!”
Again the command rang out.
There was no mistaking the meaning of it.
Harper Hicks let go the revolver and it struck the «
1 ground with a thud.	r
| “Now, then, proceed with the chastising, Mr. Schoolmaster.”
“I’ll bet a hundred dollars to a half dollar that ther big galoot wishes he’d never seen Young Wild West!” called out Cheyenne Charlie, with a laugh. “Give him a good lickin’, Wild! He ain’t no good, an’ I know itl If he» got a friend what wants ter take it up fur him let hiu1 step out here. I feel jest like wallopin’ a sneakin’ coyote* blamed if 1 don’t 1”
1 There was a silence that was only broken by the titter-ng of a few of the men, who thoroughly enjoyed the •cene.
They were the passengers who had just arrived in the stagecoach, for the most part.
“I—I-” stammered Harper Hicks, looking at his*
friends, helplessly; “1 reckon 1 must have sorter made a mistake.”
“I reckon so,” answered Young Wild West, nodding h»**.. head in his cool and easy way. “But never mind. We U see how well you can shoot now. You said you were the boss shot of the camp; let s see what you can do. . ,-Jga The villain hesitated.
“There ain't no use in havin’ any more of a row over it, Hicks ” spoke up Bill Spencer, nodding at the self-styled boss shot of the camp. “Show what yer kin do.”
“All right,” and, giving his side a gentle rub where he had been hit, the wan walked over and picked up the revolver he had dropped so suddenly. “You come out here, Bill, an’ hold up a card fur me. I’ll show Young Wild West that if 1 don’t know much about boxin’, I d° know somethin’ about shootin’.”
There was no doubt that Harper Hicks was very bitter against our hero for what had happened.
But he was making quite a success of swallowing *llS anger, just the same.
The leader of the Boomers stepped out without a11* hesitation.
It was plainly evident that he was not afraid to hoW 1 a card while his friend shot at it.	. oncl-
Hicks took a greasy pack of cards from his pock*-alter he had again rubbed the sore spot on b‘* ™ 1 derly, he selected the ace of diamonds.	apPcllf
“Jest hold ther card up, Bill,” he said, tryiJ1£ very cool.
\
YOUNG- WILD WEST BEATING THE BOOMERS.
“All right, Hicks/’ was the reply.
Then the boss shot of the camp stepped back about thirty feet, and when the card was held steady lie took aim and pulled the trigger of his revolver.
Crack!
As the report rang out everyone knew that the card had been hit.
They saw it move.
“Yer done it all right,” said Spencer,.and he hurried to Young Wild West and showed him where the bullet had passed through the card, just above the ace.
“Why didn’t he hit the ace-spot?” our hero asked, looking surprised. “There are plenty of people who could hit the card. I've got three right here who can do that.”
“You have?” asked the Boomer, and he looked at Charlie and Jim for a moment and then shook his head.
“Yer mean that there’s three in your crowd what could do it, an’ that you’re one of ’em,” he added.
“No; I mean that there are three besides myself.” “Yer don’t mean ter say that one of ther gals could make a shot like that, do yer?”
“I do. Et, just step out here and show him.”
Arietta, smiling, obeyed as fal* as the ■ stepping out was-concerned.
She pulled her Smith & Wesson revolver from the holster at her side, and, looking at Spencer, said, calmly: “Just hold up another card, please."
The man shook his head.
“Not much,” he answered. “I don’t want ter run no risk of gittin’ shot in ther hand. Yer may be a good shot, .W.*££, but yer might make a mistake, yer know.”
• ‘‘1 might, but I won't—not at that distance. Is there anyone here who will volunteer to hold up a card tor mo to shoot at?”
~The girl looked at the crowd questioningly.
“I will!” spoke up the weazen-faced man, called Croker, who was a reckless sort of a chap, anyhow. “I reckon I ain't afraid.”
“Very well; go ahead, then.”
The thin little man promptly took one-of the cards and took his place where Spencer had stood.
As he held it up the spectators saw that it was the king ol' hearts.
“We haven’t any use for king's in this country,” said Arietta, with a smile, “so I will just take off that fellow’s crown. Hold the card very still now.”
“Yer bet your life I will!” came the reply in a shrill voice.
Croker had been drinking heavily, but he could hold his hand steady, for all that.
The girl took her place in about the same spot that Hicks had stood when he gave his exhibition.
Up went the shining revolver on a line with the card, the rays of the declining sun glinting upon it like gold. Crack !
‘‘Ginger!” cried the weazen-faced man as he looked at the card. “She clipped off ther crown, jest as she said she
would, boys, an' part of ther blamed old king's heau with it!”
There was a burst of applause, which quickly wound Uj. into a prolonged cheer for the girl’s wonderful shot.
Then everybody had to look at the card.
“Gentlefnen,” said Young Wild West a moment later, “I guess it isn’t necessary for me to show what I can do. The young lady is one of my pupils, and she can beat the boss shot of the camp with a revolver, I think.”
“Shootin’ at a card an’ shootin’ at a man is two differ-; ent things, though,” remarked Harper Hicks, shaking his head in a dissatisfied way.
“How about shooting at a boy?” spoke up the dashing young deadshot. “I guess you want a shot at me, so get out there. You shoot at me, and I’ll shoot at you !”
“I—I reckon I don’t want ter shoot at yer, Young Wild West,” came from the man hurriedly.V
“Get out here. I am going to shoof-at you. Yon have got a chance to shoot at me. Hurry up. I mean business.”
A sudden silence came over the gathering.
Here was something unexpected.
Hicks cast an appealing glance at his friends, but no one spoke and he stepped out and did something that showed him up for just what he was.
He threw up both hands and stood there, the picture of fear.
'The bright red handkerchief that was loosely knotted about his neck showed in great contrast to the pale, sallow face of the bluffing villain.
“So vou don't want a shot at me, eh?” said Young Wild West, coolly. “All right. Just stand around sideways and I'll take a shot at you. I won't hurt you, though. 1 won't touch your skin, even. I'll untie that handkerchief that is around your neck, that’s all. Drop your arms!”
The Boomers looked relieved.
Hicks stepped around in a mechanical way and lowered his hands.
Wild whipped out a shooter, and, taking a quick aim, pressed the trigger.
Crack!
The whip-like report rang out and the handkerchief about the man's neck moved with a jerk.
The bullet had hit the knot squarely, and though it did not come entirely loose, the spectators realized that it was a remarkable shot.
“That will do,” said the boy. “I always hit what I shoot at, and I knew I wouldn't hurt you. If you are all satisfied we will look for a place around here to pitch our camp. It is getting late, ami 1 feel a bit hungry.”
A cheer went up from the majority of the men.
Those who remained silent belonged to Bill Spencer's gang of Boomers.
'They did not seem to like 1*he dashing young deadshot much.
But that oulv went to prove that they were not as honest a< lliey ought to be.
fc	YOUXG WILD WEST BE
It was strange as it was true that men inclined to be dishonest and villainous, even to a small degree*, always took a strong dislike to Young Wild West.
But he did not mind that, rather thinking it a sort of honor, instead.
The boy wanted no friends unless they were straight.
Jack Marshall, the man who had named the camp, and who was looked upon as a sort of leader by the miners, now walked out of the c-rowd and exclaimed:
“ Put up j'our tent wherever yer see fit ter, Young Wild West. I say that you an’ your friends is welcome ter Dizzy Wealth. That settles it!”
“Thank you, my friend/* retorted Wild, who sized the man up to be a pretty good sort of a fellow, a little inclined to go to the bad. “We will stop right over there near the brook, if no one has^any objections.”
Xo one had, so the party moved over to the spot and got at work putting their camp in shape.
The two Chinamen put up the tents in a way that showed how well they knew their business, while Young Wild West and his partners saw to it that the horses were well taken care of.
By the time the sun had disappeared below the line of the western horizon the camp was in pretty good shape and Wing Wall, the cook, hail started a fire.
The girls assisted him, and soon a pot of coffee was over the fire and some venison steaks spitted and ready for broiling.
But that was not all, either. The scout's wife was making sorae of her famous corn muffins, which she baked in a double pan, after the blaze got down.
It was a sort of improvised oven, the two frying pans fastened together, for she could turn it over at will, and biscuits and muffins could be made with great success.
Young Wild West and his friends always lived good, so long as they could get what they wanted froai the stores in the mining camps and settlements.
In half an hour from the time the fire had been lighted by the Chinaman the supper was ready, and they sat down and did full justice to it.
Venison, mutfins and coffee isn't such a very bad meal to take, anyhow.
When they were through eating it was quite dark, and the lights in the few scattered shanties at the mouth of the gulch were shining like stars out from a background of dark green.
The mantle of night had been cast upon Dizzy Wealth camp.
CHAPTER U\.

It wa^ tiitt lout; after our .friends had e>ilen their i-ven-iiis.r when K ui'-’iid Dailey, ilu* lend^rf'mt^ oygj. to tiit*ir camp.
ATIN'G THE BOOMERS.
“Excuse me/’ he said as he approached Wild, made up my mind that I was going to come over to »e« j you. I was much impressed by what you did to the ha man, and 1 made up my mind then and there that v°u could no doubt give me" a little- advice. Are there auy objections?”	1
As he asked the question he looked at the res^ a manner of respect.
“I guess there are no objections whatever, my friend,, answered the young deadshot, smiling at his extrem0 politeness. “I can tell quite easily that you are a strange1" in these parts.”
“That is right. 1 am what you folks no doubt call tenderfoot. But I can’t help that. If I remain in West very long I may become something different.”
“Oh, you are all right, I guess. I have a way of sizing strangers up, and I made up my mind what sort of a fello"' you were when I first saw you in front of the saloon. B«*
1 don’t think much of the galoot you were talking to whe» we rode up, though.”
“Well, that is something I want to talk about. He said his name was Bill Spencer, and that he and his friends-" something like a dozen of them—own the best claims in the camp. He wants to sell mo a claim.”
“Oh, he does, eh? Well, what do you want to buy ** claim for? Why don’t you stake one out ?”
Dailey then told who he was, and what he had come to
Dizzy Wealth camp for.
He took a seat, on being invited to by our hero, and then they had quite a little chat, the rest joining in.
Wild learned from him that he had a large amount o.f money with him, and that he had been worrying ever since he had been in the wilderness about being robbed of it.
“So .vou mean to invest in some mining property, (l° you?” lie said to him, after lie had thought the thing ow*-“Well, that is quite a risky thing to do. Such a fellow you can do about as well by remaining in the East taking chances on the game, I think. You know veC' little about gold desposits, and if a man tried to fleece y°x\ vou wouldn't know it. But I'll say this much: Don't h11' any property of Bill Spencer. I never saw him until j arrived here a little over an hour ago, but I atn that he is a crook.”	,«
“1 am more than obliged to you for your opin*011^, replied the tenderfoot, and he was deeply in earnest ^1,1 he said it.	•	|#
'‘Well, if I didn’t think that way I wouldn’t tf?l1 If you want more advice just stay around here 11 "rp|ii'p before you invest vour money in any mining land*

I guess you are right on that.”	i^ce llA Bill Spencer and hix crowd are booming	* * ■»u*l ioMhe purpose of makim. money,, no more claims they can sell the letter they will be
“I see. I’m going to take your advice to the very letter. Do you propose to stake out a claim here?”
“'Well, I had no such intention. You see, we had no idea that there was a camp here. We happened along by accident, as I said over in front of the saloon.”
The man from the East looked disappointed.
“I thought if you were I might get one next to you,” lie said. “I don’t know anything about prospecting, but I would run the chances of staking out a claim alongside of one you had.”
“Well, we may take a notion to stake out one in the morning. If we do I’ll let you know before we pick it out, and you can go with us.”
“Thank you, Mr. West. I only hope you do make up your mind to do it. I came to' Dizzy Wealth with the expectation of making money and I hate to have to leave without having a try at it. Now there is one more thing I would like to ask of you.”
“What is that, Mr. Dailey?”
“I have engaged sleeping quarters at the saloon, or hotel, as the owner calls it, and I am to bunk in a room with three others. What you said about Spencer just now has led me to believe that it would not be safe for me to go to sleep with all my money on my person. I wish yQU would agree to keep about ten thousand dollars for me till I call for it.”
“That is something 1 don't like lo do,” and Young Wild West shook his head. “You s<?e, it might be that we got robbed ourselves. Then we would be placed in a rather awkward position. No one is exactly secure in -these parts, you know.”
“(Jli, but I feel.quite sure that none of those men would rob you,” said Dailey, earnestly. “They all fear you, .since you handled the fellow who calls himself the boss shot of the camp the way you did. They wouldn’t dare to bother you.”
“Don’t you believe that. While they might be afraid to face me, they would not. fear to do something on the sly. Why, I’ll bet a five-dollar gold-piece to a silver quarter that Harper Hicks is even now trying to think of some way to get square with me. ^ ou see, I have met so many of his class that 1 know them like a book. ’
“Well, you ought to know, I am sure. But 1 will run ihe risk of letting you have ten thousand dollars oj my monov, and vou needn’t "ive a receipt for it, either. 1 will theij have two thousand dollars in my pockets. 1 have more money in the Denver bank, too.”
“Well, I’ll agree to keep it for you, then.”
It was just then that our hero heard the sound of a foot fall close to the camp.
It was now as dark as it would be during the night, and, though he could not. see anything, he w;is pretty certain that there was someone behind the bushes near them.
An eavesdropper!
Wild did not let on that he had heard anything, and he continued :
“I’ll take the ten thousand dollars, and I’ll hide it in
' the camp here. I’ll show you just where 1 put it, so if anything happens to me you can c-ome and get it yourself. No one but you and I will know just where it is.”
“All right. But I think it would be quite safe on your person, Mr. West,” said the tenderfoot, who could not understand why it was that the boy wanted to hide it somewhere around the camp.
But he was willing to anything he said, so he promptly produced a fat wallet and counted out ten bills of a thousand denomination each.
Wild took them, and when he had counted them over he arose to his feet.
“Come on,” he said. “We will hide the money.”
“Here is a buckskin bag I bought in Denver; vou can
O	O
put the bills in that,” and Dailey produced the article in question and handed it over.
Wild did so, and then he led the way to a small clump of evergreen trees not far from the bank of the stream that came down through the gulch.
There was a flat stone there, which ho had seen when he was putting out the horses, and ai'ter looking to see that none of those in the camp were watching, lie turned the stone over and placed the bag in the hollow.
Then he pushed the stone back mi place and said: “There, Mr. Dailey, I guess your ten thousand will be safe there. I'll keep an eye on the stone.’’
“All right, Mr. West,” was the reply.
They wen I back to the rest and our hero took a position where he could see the exact spot the money had been placed in.
The tenderfoot remained there an hour longer, and when he had gone Wild promptly got up.
“Charlie,” said he, “just take a walk around the camp and see if anyone is spying on us.”
“All right,” answered the scout, not knowing that there was anything up.
He did as he was told and soon came back and reported that everything was all right.
“Good !’ said our hero, who knew very well that Charlie had made no mistake.
rI hen he went over to the stone, turned it over and picked up the buckskin bag.
tearing a leaf Irom a small memorandum book he carried, he scribbled' the following upon it:
“Compliments of Young Wild West."
He then wrapped the piece of paper about some leaves, and, taking the money from the hag. pm in Ihe leaves and paper.
Under the stone the bag went, and with ihe ten thousand dollars in his pocket, Wild went b.iek to- his friends. Later on he gave Dailey the money ba<-k.
“What in thunder did yer want ter pm all that money over there fur. Wild?” asked Charlie, looking shaT-pb- at the young deadshot.
“Just for a bluIV.” was ihe reply. “Them wjm soiy-eunc listening when Hailey and I wore talking aii-'.ni. d**ir.f> is and i am quite sure that we were wateln-d when it wav. puf
there. 1 heard someone in the bushes over there. I wasn't mistaken, 1 know. Now just wait and sec what happens.”
“Great gimlets1/’ exclaimed the scout, using his favorite expression when he was surprised.	1
“ Don’t say any more about it, but act the same as you! would if there was never such a thing as ten thousand dollars of an outsider's money in the camp.”
**Mister Wild, me likee takee lillee walk,” spoke up Hop Wah. the man-of-all-work, just then.	1
“Want some tanglefoot, I reckon,” said the scout, with' a chuckle. “Welt, I'll go with yer/*
“ Alice light, Misler Charlie/' and the Chinaman smiled olandly.	I
Hop was probably as innocent-looking as any Chinaman I that ever saw a tea garden.
But that was as far as it went; his looks belied him.
He was really one of the most clever of his race ini some things.	1
He was an expert sleight-of-hand performer, quite al ventriloquist, a thorough card-sharp and a practical joker. | Added to this, he liked whisky, which he always called tanglefoot, having first heard it by that name when he was beginning to acquire English.
He was very amusing sometimes, and there was not a member of the party who did not think that Hop was the best Chinaman that ever sailed over the Pacific.
On more than one occasion he had saved the lives of different ones in Die party, sojely by his cleverness.
His brother was not like him.
Wing was just an ordinary Chinaman, who knew how to cook well and was honest and willing.
Wild declared that he guessed ho would wait until morning before he looked the mining camp over, as he wanted to clean his weapons and mend his saddle.
.So Charlie and Hop sallied forth.
Of course they headed straight for the saloon.
The scout, like most all of his class, was in the habit of taking a drink of whisky now and then.
Young Wild West and Jim Dart never touched it, and since he had been associated with them the scout took very 351 tie of the stuff.
But he happened to feel in the humor just now, and, i knowing that Hop would probably get too much if he went alone, and then get into trouble, he thought he would go with him.
They went direct to the saloon and found it filled with the miners of Dizzy Wealth camp.
Some of the men were gambling, others were drinkirnr and smoking, and two or three were just intoxicated ‘■iiough to make them think they could sing and dance, and were very earnest in their efforts to prove if.
It was the same old thing that the scout had witnessed in everv place of the kind he had ever visited, so he paid lihle attention t.o what was going on and walked up to (ho bar. followed by (In.- innocent-looking Chinaman.
“'I iinL'iofuoi Vur two.’' he said, and the bottle and {.•li'sses were promptly set out by the owner of the saloon
himself, who, by the way, was making money a great »
I faster than ihe majority of the miners were.	;
^ But as he got the most of what they did make, this *a? j not surprising.	\
i Bill Spencer and his Boomers were all there, but the' ^ jwcre nearly all engaged in gambling, so they did not I1*- • lanv attention io the two newcomers.	j ^
I Charlie and Hop got their drink and then they look®1 , I around to see what was going on.
The saloonkeeper had a faro layout in the rear T°°1^ land it was here that the most of the miners were gather^ They went in and watched the men win and lose at 11
J turn of a card.
/ ^
Harper Hicks gave up playing in disgust just then, ’
raising his voice so it could be heard all through the sh®11 •
structure, he exclaimed:
“ I'll play any galoot in the house three hands of pok0^
i show-down, fur a thousand dollars. I’ve jest got. thJl
I much left, an’ I’ll double it or go broke. Who’s
\ victim V”
I w^lc takee lillee hand in urn game,** answered ii^l \ meekly.
CHAPTER IV.
1101* WIXS A THOUSAND.
Hicks looked amazed when he heard the C^naniaii accept his challenge.
He recognized Cheyenne Charlie as one of the partner*1 of Young Wild West, of course, and what he might hav* said and done had he not been there might he imagined.
All eyes were turned upon Hop, who looked as innoce?^ as a little child.
“ Vou want ter play threp hands of poker fur a thousand dollars?” Hicks asked, acting as though he hardly believed that lie had hrtird aright.
“Lat whattee me sav,” was the reply,-while a child-1 ike smile flitted over the yellow countenance of the Celestial*
“Have yer got a thousand dollars, you heathen galoot?*’
“Yes, me allee samee gottee money,” and to prove it he took a leather hag from one of his many pockets a ad showed a roll of bills of large denomination.
Then he ealinlv counted out a thousand dollars looked at the boss shot of the camp expectantly.
“Come on,” exclaimed that individual. “]?11 stick ter my proposition, even if ver are a heathen Chinee. rather play with a man, thongh,”
“Me play pokeo allee samee .Melican man,” Hop assured him.
"All right.”
Me learn um gamee in um Sunday school in I* list.
" Ver did, ehr’’
^!’?	mn «He«« samee vollv goodee Chinee.
<l N'c II won so;, how goo. I ver are. We’re goin’ lcr l’''
jest three hands, no draw, sho\y,-down, best two out of three.”	"
“Me undelstahd.”
“Well, yer want ter understand, fur if there is any kick coinin' alter yer lose there’ll be a dead Chinee here, most likely.”
“Me no kickee.”
“An* there won’t be no one ter put rice puddin’ an* roast pork on your grave, either,” went on Hicks, with a grin. “It will be a very plain funeral, yer kin bet.”
“Me undelstand.”
“Come on, then. Here's a table. Lay your money down. Your friend kin see that yer git fair play.” .
“Yer kin bet your boots I will!” spoke up the scout. “If he don’t git fair play there’s apt ter be a dead c-oyote around these diggin’s, instead of a Chinee. Jest mark that on your hat-band fur future reference!”
Charlie was not the least bit afraid to speak his mind in the place.
He knew the man he was addressing was a pretty cowardly fellow, and lie did not care for his friends any more than he did for him.
He also knew that Hop could beat the best of cardsharps at any game they proposed, so he was not worrying abou£ him losing his money.
Hop always had plenty of money, for he won a great deal that our hero and his friends knew nothing about.
Of course he got a great deal of it by means that were questionable, but that was his way, and as lie generally had to deal with cheats, it might be said that it was fair for one as another.
The two now sat down, and then the faro game was broken up.
The card games ceased, too, for a short game with a thousand dollar bet was sufficient to interest all there.
The money was placed on the table by both and Charlie took up a position where he could not only watch Hicks, but the rest of the men, too.
The scout did not intend to interfere with ihe game at all, but if Hop won the money he was going to see that he got out of the place with it.
The proprietor brought in a new deck of cards, saying as he did so:
“Ther winner pays me twenty dollars fur ther use of ther table tin' cards. 1 reckon he kin afford it.”
They both noddl'd at this and the man was satisfied.
Hop got hold of the cards and proceeded to shuttle them.
Ho kept at them until he had thoroughly mixed them, as everyone supposed, and then laid them down.
“We cuttee for urn deal,” he said, smiling blandly.
Hicks promptly reached over and cut.
It was a king that he turned over and he looked pleased.
Hop smiled more than ever and then calmly c-ut an ace.
“You win flier deal: go ahead,’’ said Hicks, who was a lilfle. disappointed, for 1 hat meant that: his opponent would have two deals in his one.
The lari was that Hop knew lu> was going to cut an ace.
His gift of sl^ight-of-hand permitted him to do things with the cards that no one would take notice of.
He now shuffled them thoroughly, at the same time getting certain cards together and just where he wanted them.
Hicks cut them and the deal took place.
The innocent smile never left the Chinaman’s face as he dealt the cards.
. Hicks waited until he got all his cards before he picked them up.
Charlie was standing where he could see his hand, and lie grinned when he saw that he did not have a pair.
“What have yer got?” asked the rascally fellow, as he laid down the hand, face up. “I’ve got ace high.”
“Me gottee lillee pair of deuces,” was the bland retort and they were promptly shown.
“Ther first leg fur you,” said Hicks, trying to appear unconcerned. “I reckon I kin deal better than you did.”
“Allee light,” was tlie reply.
The Boomer now shuffled the deck and passed it over for his opponent to cut.
Hop cut them in about the middle, the same as an ordinary player usually does.
That was just what Hicks wanted, for he had them fixed.
He dealt Hop two pair and took three aces for himself, getting them by unfair means, of course.
Every gambler there knew this, for they had seen him sorting over the cards after he first picked them up to go ahead with the deal. '
Hop had not appeared to notice it, however.
The hands were laid down and Hicks won.
“Even up!” he cried, jubilantly.
. “Now my deal, so be,” added the Chinaman, with a low laugh that sounded like the cackle of a hen more than anything else.
Hicks now grew decidedly nervous, for he had a thousand dollars staked on the game, and this was the hand that would tell the tale.
There is a wonderful fascination about a gambling game where there is a large amount of money at stake, and a deathly silence came over the room.
The miners ceased’ making comments and remained perfectly silent.
Hop ripped the cards, taking care to keep a certain few together.
Then he gave them a good shuttle and laid them down tor the cut to be made.
“They’re good enough as they are, I reckon; let ''em run,” said Hieks, no doubt thinking he was doing the best thing lie could in order to stop the Chinaman if he had “stacked the deck.”
The ehild-like expression never once left the Celestial's face and the same old smile lingered.
Hieks mopped his forehead and showed how uneasily he felt as the cards were dealt.
lle waited until Hop laid down the deck and picked up his hand before he touched his cards.
Then he picked them up one at a time.
The first was a ten spot, the second a king and the third an ace.
The fourth card was another king, and something like a sign of relief came from his lips.
The last card he picked up as though he was almost afraid to look at it.
But when he did look he could not repress an exultant chuckle.
11 was another king, making three in all.
‘‘If yer beat that hand yer beat me, an’ ther thousand dollars is yourn !" he exclaimed as he laid the cards on the table, face up.
Hop never changed expression, but acted as though lie knew it was all right, anyhow—and he clid, too.
Over went his five cards and then a simultaneous cry of amazement went up from those looking on.
‘‘Me gof.tee thlee lillee aces; allee samee beatee thlee kings!"
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when he reached over and took the stake-money.
Hicks turned as white as a sheet.
For tlie space of three or four seconds he did not speak.
Then he slowly arose from his chair and exclaimed:
“It's all right: I ain't no squealer."
“ Velly meee game*.* pokee," observed Hop, as lm tucked the money away.
Then he produced a fifty dollar bill from another pocket and tendered it to the saloonkeeper.
“Takee um twenty dollee. and givee evelybody in house mn dlinfc,*’ he said, pleasantly. “Me allee sarnee bully boy with urn glassee eye!"
Charlie went out into the barroom with him, and the crowd followed.
“That beat anything I ever .*aw in the line of gambling in my whole life!" Esmond Dailey whispered to Charlie.
The tenderfoot had witnessed the game and had been amazed from the *tart.
“Oh, that ain't nothin’,'* the scout replied. “Hop has won more?n a thousand dollars, an' quicker than that. He kin beat ther galoot what made ther cards, he kin."
“I suppose he has lots of luck.”
“Oh. int. it's his good playin'."
The man from the Hast acted as though ho did not lnirdly believe* it was due to good playing.
The fact that Hop had held throe aers against three kings looked like pure luck to him.
11 irkr Hwmed to take his loss like a philosopher.
“It*-* all right,” he said, as he took his drink with the victor. “A thousand dollars ain't much. I kin maki* that much in a day or two off ther claim f've got. Dizzy Wealth Camp i> ther richest minin’ camp in all Colorado, an' don’t ver furgit it!"
‘‘That’s right!” exclaimed Bill .Spencer. “Here's ther place ter make money, boys!"
These remarks were made for the benefit of those " w had conic over in the stagecoach, and no one knew it any better than did Cheyenne Charlie.
But the scout said nothing.
He noticed that Dailey was interested, too.
But he was satisfied that lie would not buy a claim, after having promised Wild that he was going to do as he had advised him.
Hop managed to get a few drinks and also a bottle t° take with him to the camp, which Charlie knew nothiu£ about, though he had been watching him pretty close, too.
They went back to«the camp a* little later, as thero appeared to be nothing further in the saloon for them.
The miners soon forgot the incident and turned their attention to the pastimes they were indulging in when the thousand-dollar game started.
“Well, how did you make out?” Wild asked, as the scout and Hop came back, and he saw that the Chinaman*3 face wa3|wreathed in smiles.
“I reckon it was a lucky trip fur ther heathen," was Charlie’s reply. “He won a thousand from ther galoot you licked to-night.”
“Is that so?”
“Yes; it was a flim-flam game, an’ Hop won. He wa* entitled to ther money all right.”
“Me havee velly nicee lillee timee,” npokc* up Hop, and lie did a few steps of a jig before the fire.
Charlie toid just what had happened.
"Gambling is poor business, I think," said our hero-shaking his head. “But I suppose there is no use in trying to°stop Hop from doing it. ^ He would sooner pla/ poker than eat his meals, I think.
“Lat light, Misler Wild," spoke up the Celestial. allee samee velly muchee smartee. Me gottee uncle China whattee velly muchec smartee, and me likee n1.'
uncle. My unde-”
“Shet up!" interrupted the ecout. “We don't want t°r hear about that uncle of yours to-night. Jest go ter roo-^ now. Vou've had your fun, an’ its time yer was asleep-The Celestial said no more, but made for the tent llt? occupied with the other male members of the party.
It was not long afier that when they all retired but Ho was to stand watch for the first part of the ai£^ just the same as though they were in some place wh^ there was someone likely to make an attack on the cauM^ It was a rule our hero had laid down, and he had it to bo a good one.
When Jim did his share Charlie would take his plflC and then Wild would do duty the rest of the night. j Hut no one bothered them, though Charlie ^.li’ that he was pretty certain that he had heard someone 1 the clump of cedars during his watch.	^,1*1
Wild nodded when he heard this in the mornin^^ then he went over to the spot and rolled the stone o The buckskin hag was gone.
CHAPTER V.
THE BOOMERS ARE MUCH DISAPPOINTED.
Bill Spencer and his men occupied shanties that adjoined each other.
There were only four of the shanties, for three men occupied each one.
One big shanty would have been cheaper for them, but they wanted to make it appear that they were not working together to the strangers that came, anyhow.
The fact was that outside of the pocket Jack Marshall had found but little gold had been struck by the miners.
Of course they got enough to about allow them a living and spending money, but as far as getting rich was concerned, it would take a lifetime to do it at the rate they were going, and even then they would have to be very economical.
There were twelve claims that the Boomers had staked out, making one for each, but the property lying around it Bill Spencer claimed to own, declaring that he had a deed from a man who had owned it before anyone came to the place.
Jock Marshall, the prospector, who had first discovered gold there, knew better than this, but he said nothing, letting the Boomers go ahead with their game.
If they could sell claims to strangers and make money by the operation, it was no business of his, since he had the only real claim that was worth as much as a thousand dollars.
The Boomers had not sold a claim as yet, but they all had plenty of money, since they had been in the same business in another camp but a short time before they struck Dizzy Wealth.
Spencer had figured on getting what money Esmond Dailey had the moment ho heard him say that he had come there to invest in mining property.
The rascally Boomers knew that Young Wild West stood in the way, so when he saw Dailey start toward the camp along the ctfeek he called Croker, the little man with the weazen face, and told him to sneak over there and listen to the conversation that took place.
Croker did not get a chance to make his report until after Cheyenne Charlie and the Chinaman paid their visit to the saloon, as Spencer was busy playing poker with two of the new arrivals at the camp.
But Spencer did not go back to the game when the scout and Hop took their departure, and then the little sneak called his leader aside and told him all he had heard, and incidentally what he had seen.
Spencer was enraged at Young Wild West for giving the tenderfoot such advice, but he was also delighted to hear that Dailey had left ten thousand dollars of his good money with the boy, and that it had been hidden beneath a *tone near the camp.
“Well,” said the villain, consolingly. “I reckon if we
can't sell no land ter ther tenderfoot we’ll git his money, anyhow. Croker, I want that bag yer seen Young Wild West put under that rock, an’ I want it alore mornin’, too. Yer hear what I say?”
“Sartin,” was the reply. “There won’t be much trouble about gittin’ it, Bill. I didn’t think Young Wild West was sich a fool as ter hide ther money. But he said- he didn't like ter carry other people’s money around with him, an* he didn’t ’pear ter want ter take it, by ther way he talked.”
“Well, you git to, do yer hear. An’ don’t open ther bag, either. I want yer ter hand it ter me jest as yer take it from under ther stone. I’m ther boss of this gang, an’ 1*11 ’tend ter ther money matters. If there’s any openin’ of wallets ter be done I’m ther one ter do it.”
“All right, Bill. I won’t look inside ther bag. But I know what you’ll find in it, jest as though I had put it there myself. Whew! But this will be one on Young Wild West, won’t it?”
"It sartinly will, Croker. It might teach ther young galoot ter let other people’s business alone after this. They won’t know jest who took it, though they might lay it ter Hicks, ’cause they know he must be putty down on Young Wild West. This are what 1 calls putty good when 1 come ter think of it.”
Then the leader of the Boomers enjoyed a good laugh. It was dead easy, as he thought.
In less than an hour all the members of the gang were notified as to what was in the wind.
“Meet in my shanty at two in ther mornin’,” was the orders of Spencer.
ft was a few minutes before that hour when the gang congregated there.
Some were so much under the influence of the liquor they had imbibed during the night that they took very little interest in what was going on.
Harper Hicks was one of them.	•
He had lost about all the money he had at faro, and the show-down game with the Chinaman, so he had tried to drown his troubles in tanglefoot rum.
But when he heard Spencer tell Croker to go audvget the bag of money he brightened up a bit.
“Arc yer goin’ ter divide it up, Bill?” he asked, as he rubbed his eyes and tried to straighten himself.
‘‘Yes,” was the reply, “we'll divide ther money as soon as we git it. That’s about ther be.sl way. I U take one thousand, Croker a thousand fur doin’ ther work, an ther other eight thousand kin be divided, among ther ten of yer what’s left. 1 reckon no one aiu’t goin’ ter object ter that.”
No one did.
It was a very satisfactory arrangement, so they sat clown and waited for Croker to come back.
It was fully twenty minutes hoi ore he showed up, and when ho did there was a broad grin on his face, which told his waiting companions that he had been successful.
‘‘Well, I've got ther ten thousand!” he exclaimed. “Here she is, Bill!”
He handed the bag to the leader, who gave a nod of satisfaction.
“Young Wild West ain’t a very good one fur a galoot ter let take care of his dough, I reckon,’’ he remarked.
The villains—for that was the proper name for them— crowded around to get a look at the money when the bag. was opened.
Spencer seemed in no hurry to open it.
He seemed to enjoy the eagerness of his friends, and he no doubt wished to prolong the suspense a little.
“Boys, what are yer goin’ ter do with ther tenderfoot’s money when yer git it?” he asked with a chuckle.
Various replies were given, and then the leader tossed the bag to the ceiling and caught it as it came down.
“It’s there all right,” he declared. “I kin feel it, boys. Croker said he seen ten one thousand dollar bills put in ther bag, an’ yer kin bet your life they’re there yet!” “Thunder!” exclaimed Hicks; “open it, Bill. I’m about ther only one in ther gang what’s putty nigh broke, an’ Vm anxious ter see ther money.”
“All right, I’ll open it. Here she goes!”
Then Spencer opened the bag and pulled out the contents.
As he laid what it contained on the little square table there wras a sudden silence.
A piece of paper spread out, showing spine leaves. Spencer gave a gasp and looked at his companions in mute amazement.
“Jumpin’ jack-rabbit«!” he cried, ae he found the use nf his tongue. “What does thij? mean ?”
“It means that we’ve been flim-flammed, I reckon,” said Hicks, bitterly. “I thought it was too good ter be true.” For the next few minutes the conversation in the shanty was such that would have made a timid person’s hair stand on end.
Oaths were used on every hand, and the bad names that Young Wild West was called were many.
Then they all turned upon Croker.
“Yer skinny-faced galoot!” noared Hick?. “You’ve gone an’ made monkeys out of ther whole lot of us! J’ve a notion ter lick yer!”
“It ain’t my fault,” protested the man, who was perfectly innocent, as far as the deception was concerned. “I seen Young Wild West put ther bag under ther stone an’ 1 know ther money was in it when he done it. If he took ther money out an’ put in tlior piece of paper an' leaves after I went away, it ain t tault, is it? An’ as fur you givin’ me a lickin', Harper Hicks, yer can’t do it, as big as yer are!”
There would have bepn a fight then if the leader of the bad not interfered.
He managed to quiet. the two, though they looked ai. •■a<h other tie reel y for some time after that, and showed how much they would like to get at each other and have it out.
One of the men began sorting over the leaves, as though he had an idea that the money might be hidden among them, after all.
But if that was his idea he was disappointed.
He picked up the piece of paper next, and‘then it was that he discovered writing upon it.
He could not read, so he handed it to Spencer.
“What’s writ on ther paper?” he asked.
Spencer could read, and when he saw the words he . uttered a savage oath.
“What is it, Bill?” several asked in unison.
“Why, it says on this paper, ‘Compliments of Young Wild West,' ” was the retort.
There was a short silence.
“Well, there is one way ter think, an’ only one,” served the leader of the Boomers, after a. pause. uYo«®^ Wild West must have knowed that Croker was listen111 when they was talkin’ about ther money, an’ he put ther leaveB an’ paper in ther bag jest ter make fools of lt?' Now, Croker, yer want ter be on ther lookout fur tn® boy. He knows that you’re ther galoot what tried steal ther money.”
“Maybe he does an’ maybe he don’t,” was the repl)* “But I reckon I ain’t in no danger of gittin’ hurt. Wh® do I want ter be afraid of a couple of boys an’ one man flir* when I’ve got ’leven good, brave friends what ain’t afra* of nothin’?”
He cast a sneering glance at Hicks as he spoke, and ,
hands noticed it.
“1 reckon 1 wouldn’t interfere if 1 seen Young \V>lf West shoot in’ your carcass full of holes,” retorted Hi<*l:> scowling fiercely at him.
“No; of course yer wouldn’t. You’d be afraid tfer. Thc| boy jest knocked ther stuffin’ out of yer an’ made yer }lC like a baby, more’n anything else. I know fur a fact tb*1 you stood more from him than I would. 1 would died right then an’ there, afore I would have showed th3 I was a rank coward!”
That was the last straw.	...
Before anyone could prevent him Hieks drew shooter and fired at the weazen-faced man.	j
But as close as the range was, the bullet merely a lock of hair from his head and buried itself in a he< that helped support the roof of the shanty.
Croker tried to answer the shot, but someone thrc"
his arm and knocked the revolver from his hand.	.i*
f fl*-
Hicks was disarmed, too, but he made out to Se enough to grab the little man.	I,j«i
"Jest let us alone!” cried Croker. “i'll show	I
coward that lie ain’t no good! 1 kin lick him, J
know it.”	. jl
“ i'll1
“Let ’em fight it out,” spoke up Spencer. ^ either of cm tries ter use a knife or a sho«ter 1 H iL on him. Le|. em go it. That's ther only way tei sc
I he leader was obeyed instantly.	. .^jd
The Boomers drew back as much as they couM ‘ the struggle g0 on.
Hicks had caught the little man about the body with his sinewy arm and seemed to have the best of it at the start.
But Croker was like an eel, and in less than the time it takes to record it he had wriggled himself free and had his left arm around the neck of his opponent.
Then down they went upon the floor.
Croker landed underneath, but he was not there more than a second, for his quickness enabled him to turn the big man over, and then he went at him with both fists.
He rained the blows fast and furious, and the first thing the lookers-on knew Hicks was crying enough.
Bill Spencer pulled the little man off him and then the big villain got up and ran from the shanty.
"There!” exclaimed Croker, his shrill voice sounding above the din. “I reckon that galoot will know his place after this. If a boy kin lick him I kin! I felt that way when I tackled him, an’ I’ve showed that I was right. Now if he don’t let me alone I’ll shoot him, that’s all.” "He’ll let yer alone,” said Spencer. “Just cool down a little. You’re worse than a banty rooster.”
“A banty rooster kin generally fight, too,” was the reply. “Well, I’ll put you ag'in Young Wild West ther first time I git ther chance, Croker. You’re sartinly a dandy!” “Oh, I ain’t afraid ter tackle Young Wild West, nor no' one else!” was the boastful rejoinder. “It’s too bad that we got beat out of that ten thousand, but it ain’t mv fault, on* any as says it is a liar!”	^
No one. said it was his fault, so in triumph, Croker took his departure and repaired to his own shanty.
CHAPTER VI.
CROKER MEETS HIS WATERLOO. -
There was a smile all around in Young Wild West’s camp when it became known that a thief had visited them during the night.
“It is a lucky thing that you heard the fellow when he was sneaking around last night, Wild,” said Arietta.
“Well, I don’t know about that so much, Et,” was the reply. “If 1 had not heard someone in the bushes; listening to what was being said, 1 shouldn’t have put the bag of money under the stone. That was quite a foolish thing t(-» do, you know.”
"Yes, that is so‘. I forgot about that. But it might havo been thut the villains would have attacked us during the night, 'fen thousand dollars is a big lot of money, you must admit.”
“Well, if they had attacked us I guess they would have &°t sill that was due them. It, is all right. Now we Know j“*5t what kind of people we have run up against here in •’uzy Wealth Camp. I guess we’ll stay hero a couple of days, for 1 have an idea that there will be livch’ times hero before long.”
“Yer kin bet your life there will be!" spoke up Cheyenne Charlie. “This gang of Boomers ain't none of 'em no good. Thejr?ll be lookin’ fur all kinds of trouble afore long, see if they ain’t!”
“Well, there is an old saying that anyone who looks for trouble is bound to find it, providing he don't stop looking too soon,” remarked Jim Dart.
Wing, the cook, was busy getting breakfast ready. The sun had been up but a few minutes and there was a general stillness that was only broken by the songs of the birds and the noise made by the rippling water that tumbled over a miniature rajnds a short distance up the creek.
It was just the sort of a morning to make a healthy person feel as though there was something realty worth living for, and Young Wild West and his friends were of that very sort.
The solitude of the forest, plains and mountains was what they enjoyed at times, and, though there was so much life and activity in the little mining camp right by them, they seemed to forget it as they waited for the breakfast that was being prepared.
They had been fortunate enough to shoot an abundant supply of game the day before, and they now found that it stood them in good stead.
If they had not decided to stop at Dizzy Wealth for a while, and had continued on through the vast wilderness, they would have been tempted to shoot more game, and then it would have been a sin to do it, for one who shoots what he cannot use is surely not doing the right thing.
By the time they had finished their breakfast the mining camp was astir for fair.
The miners were congregated near the store and saloon, talking over things in general before they went to their work.
“I reckon some of them fellers ain't gittin’ rich here/’ observed the scout, as he east his eye over the sloping stretch to the south, where most of the claims were located. “There ain't been a great deal of dirt throwod out. anyhow. I reckon it must, be mostly placer ore that's been found.”
“1 don’t know,” answered Wild. “But 1 mean to-.find out what the prospect is here before long. I have taken enough interest in the tenderfoot to try and set him on the right track, if 1 can.”
“Me is a good fellow, with very poor ideas of gold mining,’’ ssiid Dart.
“Those fellows don’t seem to be in any hurry about going to work, so I tntess we had better take a walk over there and find out what is going on, «»b.-er\ed our hero, a minute or two later, wlu-n he ssiw the men were still gathered where tlu*v had seen them first.
Charlie and >liiu were agreeable, of course, so, leaving the camp in charge of the girls, they walked over.
Nearly ihe entire population was gathered near the store and saloon, and our Iriends saw that: the stage, coach was being got in readiness fo leave.
“1 secy’ said Wild. “1 heard last night that the stage.
route here was a new thing. The miners are much the same as little children: they are waiting to see it off.” They found the Boomers there, too, mingling with the crowd, and our hero undertook to try and pick out the man who had paid the visit to their camp the night before.
He looked them over keenly and was not long in coming to the conclusion that it was the weazen-faced man.
He seemed very uneasy every time he looked at him, and that was pretty good evidence.
Wild said nothing, but. seeing Esmond Dailey coming cut of the saloon^ he beckoned to him.
"Good morning, gentlemen,” said the tenderfoot, his face lighting up when he saw the three. "This is a splendid morning, isn't it?'5
"Yes, as fine as could be,” answered our hero. "Say, Mr. Dailey, you know the bag you gave me to keep for you?”
"’Why, yes,” exclaimed the man, and he looked surprised.
"You saw where I put it, didn’t you?”
"Why, I—er—certainly did.”
The tenderfoot was surprised to hear the boy say any thing about it in public.
"Well, someone stole it last night while we were asleep There must have been a sneak thief watching when I put the money bag under the stone.”
As Young Wild West said this lie was looking squarely at the villain Croker, who was only a few yards distant. The little man winced and became very fidgety.	’
"Somebody stole it!” echoed Dailey, his face turning pale.
“That is just what's the matter. But don’t worry. I’ll make good for the money. I'll find out who it was that took it, too, before we leave Dizzy Wealth.”
Croker turned to walk away at this.
"Hello, you little galoot!” called out Wild. "What is your hurry? I am a mind reader, and I pick you out as the one who was sneaking around our camp last night. I'll give you just ten minutes to return that buckskin bag. I want the bag, but you can have what you found in it.” "What do yer mean?” cried Croker, affecting surprise. "I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.”
"Oh, yes, you do,” replied Wild, who was now certain that he had made no mistake.
Dailey could not understand it at all.
He had heard Young Wild West accuse the man of having stole the buckskin bag, and now he heard him say that the thief must return the bag, but could keep what he had found in it.
It was a little too much for the tenderfoot.
The Boomers looked angrily at the young deadshot, for they had not expected that he would accuse anyone so soon.
H struck thorn that-he must have been watching when Croker snea^d to the spot where the bag was hidden under the stone, and that was why he knew who it was. They crowded up so as to get around the accused, and
thus give him a chance to get away, but just then Cheyenne Charlie whipped out a pair of revolvers and exclaimed :
“Git back there, yer measly coyotes! There’s goin' tor be a fair shake here. Ther trouble is between Young Wild West an’ ther little galoot with ther hatchet-face-Let ’em settle it. Do yer hear what I say ?”
There was no question but that the scout was ready t° let hot lead fly, and those present seemed to fully realize it, too.
Jim was ready, with his hand on the butt of his rc-^ volver.
He knew that Wild knew what he was doing, and should a fight start he would not be standing idly by.
But if there was to be a fight it was not to be a genera one just then, for the Boomers fell back and allowed ott* hero to Teach the side of Croker.
The weazen-faced man was spunky, too. When he sa" that he had to face the music he did not attempt to ge away.
"What do yer mean, anyhow?” he demanded, shrilly* "I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about, young feller.” “Don’t you?” was the calm retort. "Well, you hear* what I said, I guess. The ten minutes will soon be UP‘ If that buckekin bag is not in my hands by that time y°u are going to get your medicine. Is that plain enough, °r do you want me to write it down for you?”
“If you say I took anything from yer you’re a li--■’
That was as far as he got, for with a quick punch, W11 caught him in the mouth and sent him rolling over a heap of dirt.
"Lick him, yer little fool!” shouted a voice-that our friends quickly recognized as that of Hicks. "Yer sai yer could do it last night; now go ahead an’ show us how easy it is.”
Croker got up as mad as a hornet.
He did not attempt to pull a shooter, but rushed a Wild like a wildcat springing at its prey.
Slap!
Our hero caught him on the side of the head with the flat of his hand and sent him sprawling again.
The young deadshot was as cool as an iceberg, and that enabled him to use the best of judgment.
Hicks laughed so uproariously that Bill Spencer called him for it.
"I can’t help it,” was the reply. “Ther little gal°ot' thought lie could wallop that boy, when there ain’t a m ther crowd what kin do it. I was up ag’in him, an oughter know. Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! But that was jest what I call somethin’!”
Croker was up in a twinkling.
This time he whipped out his revolver.	.
But Wild was watching for him to do this and he g° ahead of him.
Crack!
It was a wonderfully quick shot, but the bullet e straight, to the mark.
It hit the cylinder of the weapon and the little man dropped it as though he had been stung by a tarantula.
“Wow!" he yelled.
Crack!
Wild fired again and chipped a piece off the lieel of his hoot.
The spunk left Croker then.
“I'll git what yer want!" he yelled. “Don't shoot ag in, Ydung Wild West! i know you're a deadshot, but yer might make a mistake. The smartest people makes mistakes sometimes. 1 made one last night, an’ I'm sorry fur it. Don't shoot ag'in !”
“Hurry up, then,” was the calm retort.
Croker looked around helplessly.
It was plain that he did not know what had become of the buckskin bag he had stolen from beneath the stone.
He started for the shanty occupied by Bill Spencer.
The leader of the Boomers shrugged his shoulders as he saw him going, and then turned and walked into'the saloon.
He had been the last one to handle the bag, and he had tossed it iu a corner of the shanty.
He knew that Croker would find it. if he looked around, and he. did not want to get any further mixed up in the game than he was.
The little man ran swiftly to the shanty.
The distance was short, so he coon reached it.
The next minute lie came out, holding the bag in his hand.
' He came right up to Wild, aud, with a very white face, handed it over to him.	*	’
“Ah see how much trouble you could have avoided if you-had got it when 1 flr3t told you to." said our hero, smiling at him.
“Ypn’te too much fur me, Young Wild West,” was the reply. “I’ll never lift a hand ag’in yer a»’in.”
“I hope you mean that.”	&
“I do mean it. I’m a blamed little fool, that’s what I am!”
Just then the stagecoach drove up.
The attention of the miners was drawn to that for the time being, so, thinking he had gone far enough for the present, our hero turned to Dailey, who stood near, looking very much puzzled, and said:
“I guess 1 had better explain matters to you. Your money is all right, Mr. Dailey, for I took it out of the buckskin bag as soon as you left our camp last night. I heard someone near us in the bushes while we were talking, and that is why 1 told you to come to the group of cedars and that we would hide the money there. I knew somebody was watching. Do you see into it now?”
“Yes, I think I do,’’ was the reply. “My, but. this beats anything I ever heard of! I never dreamed of such a thing happening. I thought the money was gone, and I hud about made up my mind that 1 would not permit you to make good for it. I was responsible, since 1 insisted on you taking it.?’
“Well, the money is safe in my pocket. Do you want it?"
“Xo, no, you keep it till I call for it. won't you?"
“Just as you say."
As soon as the stagecoach drove off the men dispersed and went to their work, or at least the most of them did.
The majority of the Boomers had no work to do, so they simply hung around the saloon.
“I guess we had better have a drink on the strength of what has happened,” suggested the tenderfoot, with a smile. “Come inside, I want to treat the crowd.”
“Well, I feel like smoking a cigar, so I’ll go with you. Come on, boys.”
Jim and the scout followed them in, and then Dailey ordered the bartender to give everybody what they wanted.
Then Wild suggested that they have a look about the place in view of staking out a claim.
CHAPTER MI.
THE PLACER CLAIMS.
“I heard considerable talk last night, and from what I can understand a man named .lack Marshall has got a good-paying claim,” said Esmond Dailey, as they left the .saloon to take a look around the diggings. "I have found out about where his claim is. so suppose we go there first?"
’“Just as well as not," answered our hero. ** It makes no difference to me."
But the tenderfoot was a rather poor hand at remembering, so they had to ask a miner, who was sitting -ome dirt near the bank of the creek, where Marshall's claim was.
He pointed it out to them and they went up to it.
The man who had named the camp was there himself.
He was working the pocket he had struck in a wid»j crack under an overhanging ledge.
Marshall was a man who was not averse to talking about his luck, so he stopped work and gave them a glowing account of what he had been doing.
Wild questioned him in an off-handed way and soon came to the conclusion that he was not in league with tin-Boomers.
“ How did you come to strike this place?" he questioned, after a while.
“Well, T happened ter notice that it wasn t all rock right here, and when I found it was nothin' moiv'n filled with dirt I started in ter digging was the reply. “I wain putty hard luck, an' 1 was willin’ ter work hard for strike somethin' what was worth while. 1 hadn x durr more'n a foot or two when 1 struck some liitle chunks tluu 1 knowed was ther real stuff. They didn't amount ter a great deal, fur sure, but it was enough t^v make ;i •* i ;
Ion goin* under ther cliff. Ther lu-xt- day I stru-vk it ri<-?i.
an.' Vve been livin’ on ther sunny side of ther voad ever since."
Our hero looked flown the slope and saw that there was evidence ot a dry watercourse leading from the cruel under the cliff.	}
“Who owns the claim next to you—below, I mean?’ he quc-tUmed.
‘’Well, I reckon no one does that I know oL Bill Spencer has ?ive it out that him and his pards.has bought the whole stretch along ther creek, though.”
“ You don't believe he has bought it, then?”
“Tor tell ther truth, 1 don't, Young; Wild West.”
“Well, I guess we'll stake out a couple of claims here,' anyhow. If the Boomers own the land, and can give pmi] of it, we'll vacate if they tell us to; otherwise we'll hold on to them until we find ont that they are no good.”
The miner nodded.
'*1 reckon Spencer won't bother you folks much,” tie^h said. “ I guess he's putty square, in his way, anyhow.” i “Jn his way he may be, but I don't think much of his \ wav. But never mind. So long as he don't bother us we j won’t bother him.”
Then they asked Marshall to loan them his ax, and as Charlie received it from him Wild went to the stake on the lower .end of the claim and began pacing down the hill;
The scout was cutting some stakes, and when ho had them ready our hero showed him where to put them.
In about an hour they had staked out two claims, the tenderfoot helping them all he could, and wondering what* it all meant.
“Are you going to occupy this land while you stay herer” he asked, when the job was done.
“Yes, for a while. There are two claims here; which one do you wantr”
“Well, 1*11 leave that to you. You know more about it than 1 do.”
“1 don't know anything about this place, any more than that I saw that Jack "Marshall is digging out good rich dirt up there. Of course I have an idea that there might be some on these two claims we have staked out, but if there is it will not amount to anything very great. It will be very near the surface, for if we find anything here it will be a plat-er.”
“A placer, t-h? i have heard of plater claims, but 1 don't just know what they are like.”
“Wull, I can give you a pretty good idea about it in a very few words. Do yon notice the crooked, hollow streak that runs down this way from Marshall's claim?”
“Yes, it looks as though water comes down when it rains.”
“ Exactly. Xow do you note the course of the creek? K runs almost parallel with that streak, don’t it?”
“Yes. it certainly does.”
“W<*11. it may have been that the water came down through h<-re at one time, instead of where it does now. If that is the easy it is a pretty sure tiling that there is gold in the dry watercourse, for it has no doubt been
■" " " . \ t * washed out of that creek in the rock, \' tere - ^
ipocket it. It there is any here it will be pj’Acer g • ^
\cause it has been placed here l>y the running wa 1 ^
\will be found in scales and small particles, mixed 'u ^
the dirt. Now before we prospect any 1 guess we ^
better move our camp up here. There is nothi^c
Ibeing near your work, you know.”
\ “That's right, Mr, West. I think I will buy a ^ \
\eles at the stove and camp right near you, if yott r 'mind.”	pV I
“No need of that, Mr. Dailey. You just buy a c° ^ V of blankets and come and put up with us. We NVl t1' '
[here long enough to find out whether it will pay S°" :
\ remain.”
\ ilf1'
“ Thank you, Young Wild West \” exclaimed, the
foot. “Wasn 11 lucky when I fell in with you an^ • ^
, friends i 1 am mote than glad. 1 supposed I wonhl x ,
tbeen fleeced out of all ray money if you had not c° t
1 along by accident, for I realty believed what Bill Spe*
“Well, 1 hardly suppose you would have been f°°U[u- \ enough to invest all your money in land that is practi^J \ 'vorthless. \ou would ha« probably gone a little first. However, if the villains found out that you U (much money with you they would have got it froi* ^ anyhow. What happened last night is proo£ enou^1 that.”
“1 should say so.”
They now walked back to the camp, and Wild, prompt bade the Chinamen to get things ready to move.
“Which way now, Wild?” Arietta asked.
“We’ll move up the creek about a quarter of a mile; v,c have just staked out a couple of claims. One i» for Mr-Dailey, and I guess you can call the other one yours, «/.
I taJi think Ly will amount to much, though « may
find enough deposits to pay us for ^e	. . -i
“Ml right,” was the reply- “I’l take the clam,, and
Til bet I’ll have pretty good luck wi \i'.
The wo* ot moving their niters soon began Charlie and helped the Clunamen while W.ld woo* to the store with -Dailey to pick out the lew things W needed.
Our her<» had taken just enough interest in the tender foot to see him through right.
In case the claims turned out to be worthless he me*111* to try and discourage hitn from investing his money 1,1 mining property.
It was too much of a risk for a person who knew notl*' ing at all about the business.
The two reached the store and went inside.	,
They found Harper Hicks there. He was purcha81’^ a bottle of liniment to apply to the bruised portions 1 anatomy that had been caused by the rough handling had received from our hero, and also from Croker. ^ The best the storekeeper could do for him was him have a bottle of stuff that was labeled horse I11111*
but tlie villain sai(l he thought that would be all right, j and, paying for it, he lel't the building in a hurry.
The coward was afraid to be near where the young dead-shot was.
It it had not been for our hero Dailey would have been charged about four times what the blankets he bought were worth; as it was, he got an amount equal to double their value.
W hen he was fixed up Wild looked at the storekeeper keenly and said:
“Are you doing much business here?”
"A putty good business, I reckon/’ was the reply. “If it only keeps up like it started 1*11 be satisfied.”
“Don’t you think it is going to keep up?”
“Well, I don’t know. I ain't heard of anything great keiV done here yet There’s been lots of money afloat* it is blamed little gold dust I ve seen.”
“You haven't got dizzy from the wealth that’s here yet, then?”
“No. I reckon there's only one galoot that has, an’ that's Jack Marshall.”
“Well, there will be more to strike it rich here pretty
“I hope you’re right.”
Wild and the tenderfoot now went out.
They were just in time to see their friends moving away ^r°iii the spot they had camped at overnight.
“Mr. Dailey,” said our hero, “according tp what the storekeeper says, this is not such a wonderful place, after all. I guess the most of it is wind. The storekeeper »ot Pooled when he came lieie, and I think he knows it ton M “It looks that way,” was the reply.
“Well, I hope things do turn out all right, but it is my opinion that in a couple of months from now' Dizzy Wealth °ainp will be about deserted.”
“Do you really think so?”
“Yes. About all the gold there is around here is the P°cket Jack Marshall found and what has washed from it (^llHng the years gone by.”
<<?Well, I suppose it won’t be the first place that has been * failure.”
^ ‘Oh, no. There are more failures in this line than are ^ °r heard of. The rascally boomers to be found through ,West are responsible for the loss of a good deal of tj^y from the unwary ones. When a fellow can walk vlfh, a camp and see men working away and finding the i)i'iu hero and there, then you know there is some-w°rth while. But here it is different. We haven't worth while, except the claim of Mar-
r\
tllat is verytrae- Bnt the P,ace is new yct’mi
V^iiri1’? ll{^en’t had a chance to find out just what may ,	hoi-o ”
Mi- exactly. They are living in liopes. 1 te"
''v	if * wasn’t; for the h°1,es of Wtcr things
• 0 tlwre would bo a long list of sxiici.los.”
8 I guess. The majority live m hopes.
They now joined the party and moved up 10 the spot where the staking out had been done.
“Which claim do you want, Dailey?” our hero asked.
“Whichever you say,” was the answer.
“All right, then. You take the one to the right and we will try the one to the left. Hop, just get the tents up over there by that tree.”
It was settled in a hurry.
All hands assisted and things were in ship-shape order.
The grass was rank and nutritious along the bank of ih** creek, so the horses were well provided for.
“Now, then, we'll start in at work,” said Young Wil l West. “Come on, Dailey; a little exercise with a pick an>l shovel won’t hurt you a bit. You need it, in fact.”
“I know that,” was the laughing rejoinder. “I'll show you that I can work pretty well when I make up my mind to.”
Wild showed him about where to go at it, aud then he went over to where Charlie and Jim were starting in.
The girls were watching in an interested way, for the}’ expected to see good results.
Young Wild West generally had good results when he started to work a claim.
In less than hall’ an hour from the time the work began Wild found some very rich deposits.
“We have struck a placer all right,” he said, calmly. “There may be something in it that is worth our while.’’
A few pans of dirt were washed and then he became satisfied that a hundred dollars a day could be easily made there, as long as it lasted, anyhow.
He wont over to where the tenderfoot was digging away, and perspiring rather freely.
“Found anything yet?” he asked.
“I think so,” replied Dailey. “But I don’t know for sure.”
“Well, you ought to find something. You are working the same streak that we are. Let me see how the dirt looks.”
The boy got down on his knees and began examining the earth the man had been digging up.
It was full of lliiky particles that were bright and shining, and of a reddish color.
“Is that gold, or is it copper?” asked Dailey.
“ It is gold, as sure as vou're horn !” exclaimed the young* deadshot, rising to his feet. “Hailey, you have struck it all right! Thorp are more deposits hero than where wr are working, and our claim promises to pay pretty well. I guess we were in a streak of luck when wo staked out these claims.”
“Hurrah!” cried the tenderfoot, throwing down his shovel and waving his hat in the air.
Just then half a dozen men came running toward them. Bill Spencer was at their head, and when Wild saw Ih. m he knew that trouble was brewing.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE CLAIMS A HE IN DISPUTE.
Bill Spencer and five of his men were coming direct for the spot where our friends were standing.
There was nothing hostile in their manner, either, but our hero knew that something was up.
“I redcon you?ve made a little mistake, Young Wild West," the leader of the Boomers called out. “This land belongs ter me. I bought it ter speculate on, yer know. I'll be glad ter sell these claims to y.er if yer want ter buy.''
l*Oh, I guess the land don't belong to you," Wild answered, in his cool and easy way. “You are only bluffing, that's all.”
“Xo, 1 ain't bluffin'. I've got ther documents ter prove that ther land is mine,-' Spencer insisted.
Then, he drew a document from his pocket and held it out.
“Read that/’ he said.
Wild took it and read it over.
It really was what purported to be a deed for certain land near the mining camp of Dizzy Wealth, and the rude diagram was surely meant for that part of the land, for the creek was the starting point.
The name of a government land agent was on it, too, but there was no seal to make it look authentic.
Wild quickly decided that the document was a fraud.
It struck him right away that Spencer could not have had time to get a deed of that kind for the property, since it would take weeks to do it.
“Who gave you this deed?" lie asked, coolly.
“T. H. Harley, ther man what's in charge of ther government lands here. There's his name in his own writin*', sight on ther paper."
“Where did you get the paper from him?”
“Over in Red Gulch, a week ago."
“Why didn't he put the seal on it:"
“I don’t know nothin' about that. I paid him ther money, an’ that's ther paper be give me in receipt fur it. He said ther land was mine, an* that no one could bother it. I own a thousand acres here.”
“You do, eh? Well, .Mr. Spencer, I guess I'll have to . have better proof of your ownership than this document. We will stay right here until I do. We have staked out two claims in the regular way, and we are going (o keep them until we find out that they don't belong to us. How does that strike you ?”
“ You?re foolish ter try arr go ag'in ther law," wa? the reply.
“Am I? Well, we'll wait and see about that. You just move off! now, and let us alone.”
“We don’t want no trouble with ver, Young Wild West.
I didn’t come here fur that. But what's mine is mine. I j want five thousand dollars ajjiece for these two claims.” !
“Perhaps we had better pay him," spoke up Esmond Dailey, who was not a little frightened at what the villain said.
“Perhaps we had better not," retorted Wild, who had seen enough deeds from land agents to know that this <>ne was nothing more thau a forgery. “We'll stay right hen* until we get better proof that the land belongs to him, Dailey. You do as 1 say and you’ll come out at the top ol the heap."
“All right. 1 won't say anything more.”
“Do yev want ter pay me five thousand dollars fur thei claim you’ve started ter work on, Dailev?” asked Spencer, turning to the tenderfoot.
“No," was the retort.
“All right, then. Maybe you'Jl wish yer had afore thei thing is settled."
“See here," said Wild, coolly, “you seem to want that ten thousand dollars Dailey gave* me to keep for him pretty bad. You wanted it so badly that you sent one of your men to steal it last night. But you didn't get it ! An’ let me tell you, you won’t, either. You have got ?ixty seconds to get out of sight. Vamoose !”
The young deadshot drew his revolver and stood in h business-like attitude;
The Boomers turned and walked away without another word.
It was/plain that they did not want to have a scrimmage with our friends, even if they outnumbered them.
Their leader put the document he had shown in his pocket as he went, and it was evident that he was much disappointed.
About twenty minutes later one of the strangers, who had arrived in the stagecoach the day before, came along-He carried some prospecting tools with him, and, after speaking to our friends pleasantly, started in to staking out a claim next to them.	’
“Tve bought this claim," he said. “1 am taking tl chances on it, since I heard that yon have struck, it rich. “Who told you that we had struck it rich?" Wild asked. “Why, Bill Spencer, the man who sold the claims to you," was the quick reply. “You have found gold dust all right, haven't you??
“Yes, we have struck a little of it. But if Bill Spencer said he sold us any land lie lied. We staked this out, and we are not going to pay him a cent for the land."
The man was much surprised.
“lie said you give him five thousand dollars apiece for ther claims," he declared. “1 only paid (wo thousand for mine. 1 thought I was gottin' it dirt cheap."
“You have been swindled out of two thousand dollars, then, that's all. Hill Spencer never owned this property, and you’ll find that out before we go away from here."
The miner was surprised, as well as sore, when he heard this.
But he was one of the sort who are bound to make the best of everything, and he went right on a ml meamircxl oil tlie piece of land.	. '
‘‘If Bill Spencer is a fraud I’ll try an? git my money hack when ther time comes,” he said.
He went at work digging as soon as he had driven the necessary stakes, and as part of the dry watercourse cut through a corner of his claim, he found a little pay-dirt right at the start.
“I guess I’ll git my two thousand dollars back,” he called out,'as he paused and looked over at our friends. “There’s somethin’ here. I ain’t made no mistake.” •
“ Good! Go ahead and win out. But you might better have kept your two thousand dollars, though.”
When it came noon Wild gave up work.
There was nothing exciting about sifting out pretty good pay-dirt for him, since he had been through the same thing so many times and had been very successful.
He began to think that the Boomers were a pretty tame lot of villains, for they did not put up any fight.
But the chances were that they were waiting for the proper time.
The girls were helping the cook get a tempting meal ready when Wild, Charlie, Jim and Dailey quit work and Went over to where the tents were located.
As they had not been compelled to hurry with it, the same as they would have done if they had been traveling, and had merely halted for the purpose before continuing on their way, they were getting up a bill of faro that was a little extra.
"Well, what is it to-day, Wing?” our hero asked the cook, as he sniffed the air and nodded approvingly.
“Venison stew, bloil quail, bakec potatee, hot corn muffins and um finee coffee; evelyting cookee velly muchee nicee, Misler Wild,” answered the Chinaman.
The eyes of Dailey sparkled with pleasure.
* ' "I hardly think I would have such a bill of fare as that ^ oyer at the hotel,” he said. “I ought to be thankful that I have changed my boarding place.”
“Well, you won’t get any better at any of the hotels, I guess,” answered Wild. “We generally live pretty good, unless it is impossible to get the food to cook. We have been compelled to go without coffee and anything in the line of bread for two or three days at a time, but we ’always manage to have meat or fowl.”
If ever there was a pleased man it was the tenderfoot '▼hen he began to eat his first meal with Young Wild West and his friends.
He found that his appetite was bigger than he expected, but that made no difference, as there was an abun-dance of food.	'
“1 don’t feel like going to work now,” he said, as he ai’ose. “I must have a good cigar before I do, anyhow. 1 Avill go over to the hotel and buy some. I meant to stock llP this morning before I left, but forgot to.”
^I’lI go with you,” spoke up Wild. “It might be that Boomers would try to make trouble for you if you AVGnt alone. They are none too good to do it.” shall he glad to have you go, Mr. West.”
jf y,-,n please. T guess you know me well enough
now to call me by the name all my friends and acquaintances call me.”
“Very well, Wild. You will please me better if you will drop ‘mistering5 me, too.”
“I have been doing that off and on, Dailey,” was the smiling retort.
The two soon started off and walked leisurely toward the collection of 6hanties.
They founcl the majority of the miners, as well as tlic rascally Boomers, gathered around the store and saloon.
There was something unusual going on as our two friends came up.
A green-looking German stood in front of the saloon, smiling at the crowd and acting as though he was pretty tired.
Near him were three saddle horses and a pack-mule that was loaded with a camping outfit.	i
Bill Spencer was questioning the man about something, but when he saw Wild and the tenderfoot come up he ceased and stepped back a few paces.
The German nodded at the two and smiled pleasantly. “Dis vos a fine day alretty,” he observed.
‘‘Yes,” answered the young deadshot. “You look as though you are lost. What is the trouble?”
“Dere vos no troubles, my dear boy, only dot 1 vos putty hungry alretty. Der boss und his sister vos try to get somedings to eat in der hotel, und if dey vos gid it t vos gid it, too, putty quick.”
Our hero knew very well that there was one or more with him, and as one of the horses had a side-saddle on it, it was easy to judge that one of them was a female.
No wonder, then, that the minors were interested.
The girls with Young Wild West had been the first of their sex to come to Dizzy Wealth Camp, and now in less than twenty-four hours another had arrived.
The German was certainly a comical-looking fellow, but when the men grinned at him he only smiled.
Our hero sized him up and made up his nu'ud that he was not just what he was made up for.
It struck him right away that the mau was disguised, and that being the case, it was not likely that he was a green German at all.
He did not question him, however, but wrrt inside the saloon.
It was not hard to pick out. the man's boss.
Standing at the further end of the bar. talking to the man who owned the place, was a man of thiriy-ilre. attired in a corduroy suit and wearing a t<»nrir-t s nap.
He was armed with a rifle. revolver and hunting knife and appeared to he. one. who was familiar with the customs of that wild part of the country.
“r*m sorry ter say that yer can’t git nothin’ ter eat just now,” the proprietor was saying as the two entered. “Ther man what does ther cookin' has gone an’ got drunk, an’ there ain't, a thing cooked in ther house.”
“That is too had,” answered the strati^er. “Welt, I
guess we’ll have to make out with what little we brought with us from Red Gulch.”
He turned and walked through a doorway into another part of .the shanty, and the next minute he appeared on the porch with a good-looking girl of twenty.
Wild waited for Dailey to buy the cigars he had come for and then he went out and approached the couple.
“Excuse me,” he said. “I heard what the landlord said about supplying you with something to eat. If you will just ride over to our camp you will be accommodated. There are ladies there, too, so that will make it pleasant for the young lady.”
They both brightened up at this invitation.
'To whom am 1 indebted to for this kindness?” asked the man.
“ Young Wild West is my name, sir.”
“What?”
The stranger put out his hand.
“ I have heard so much about you that I ought to know you,” he went on to say. ‘‘Certainly we will aceept your invitation." 1 am John Gregory, and this is my sister Kate Shake hands with the greatest young hero of the West there is now, or ever was. Kate.”
The girl blushingly obeyed.
Wild took it very calm. He did not get puffed up when he received praise, for that was not his way.
He always took it for what it was worth.
He introduced Dailey to the two, and then they all started for the camp along the creek, leaving the miners and Boomers staring at them in wonder.
There was plenty there to lot the strangers have what thev wanted to eat, and Wild knew it.
His partners and the girls were surprised when they w them come up, and Hop grinned as he looked the German over, and then he nodded in a pleased way.
CHAPTER IX.
WILD JS PUZZLED.
.John Gregory and his sister were soon'introduced by Venn** Wild West, and as soon as the situation was made plain'preparation.- to get them something to cat were under way.-
Growirv explained that lie had a little business over that wav, which had come upon him rather unexpected, and a.- he did not wish to leave his sister in such a place as [?"<} i;„|rh ;don*\ he had brought her with him.
The Gorman had been pieked up by him a few weeks before, and he had engaged him to go with him on his travel?- throughout the mining district ol the Slate as a helper.
(fe did n»f. .-tale what hi.: !>u.-i)Kvs was, Hnd, of course, no one asked him.
But he proved to be a very nice sort of a guest and the girls were delighted with Kate, his sister.
Arietta thought it a bit strange that their guests should insist that the German servant should eat with them, and she spoke to Wild about it.
"I think there is something peculiar about that fellow, ’ she said. “1 don’t think he is a real greenhorn. I really believe he is disguised.” '
“So do I, Et,” was the calm reply.
“You do, Wild?”
“Yes.”
“What can it mean?”
“I don’t know, but I guess I won’t be long finding out* “Do you think there is anything wrong with Gregory or his sister?”
“No, I don’t. I don’t believe there is anything wrong with the German, either—that is, as far ag his honesty or character goes. I think that he has come here for a purpose.”
“What can the purpose be, Wild?”
“Perhaps to buy land from the Boomers,” an^ ^ie young deadshot laughed.
The conversation was checked just then, for Gregory came up.
«I want to pay you for the very fine meal your cook served us,” he said, pulling a roll of bills from his pocket-“It is the best meal I ever ate that was cooked by a campfire.”
“Well, put your money in your pocket,” replied oUr hero. “We never charge anything for meals that our cook serves. You can consider yourselves our guests as long a?, we remain here in. Dizzy Wealth.”
“Young Wild West, I want to ask you a question,” sa*1* Gregory, as he put his money back in his pocket changed the subject rather abruptly.
“Well, what is it?”
“What did you come here for?”
“Well, Sir. Gregory, we landed here by aeciden*‘ Neither I nor my friends knew that there was place as Dizzy Wealth.”	(j
“Ah, 1 see,” and the man looked at him in a pllzZ
-	'	A
“We would not have stayed as long as this if we ha (t. found that there was a gang here who are fleecing ers by selling them claims that are practically It was more for the sake of Dailey than anything dsC 1 decided to stay here and see the thing through. ^e considerable money, and the Boomers want it.”* “Boomers, eh? Well, I rather think they^nust bc 51 lot.”	i
“Oh, there is nothing so very dangerous about ordered half a dozen of them off the premises I,er°fp|it»y morning and they went lik,. ^o many little	&
are no good, Mr. Gregory, but they might be <«im, thu got a chance. The leader of them sa,Vs 1 ,{nJt this tal Wft,re occupying at (his nliliute. He	10
a deed, nine!) I believe lo be hocus, and so I told
out. He wanted us to pay ten thousand dollars for the two claims we have staked out.”
“Ah, he has what purports to be a deed, eh?”
"Yes, and it has the name of T. H. Harley, the Government Land Agent, signed to it.”
“Do you know Harlej'?”
“No. But I have heard of him.”
“You don’t think he signed his name to the paper, then?”
“No, I don’t. I think the paper is a forgery, and that the Boomers are all rank frauds.”
“Well, I guess you think just right.”
“Why, do you know anything about them?”
“I have heard considerable about Bill Spencer and .his crowd of ‘Boomers/ This is not the first place they have struck. They have fleeced innocent buyers out of something like two hundred thousand dollars in the past year.” “Is that so?”
“Yes, as far as I can learn.”
“Well, if you wait here a couple of days I’ll show you how we will beat the Boomers. j\ly partners and I always take delight in straightening out crooked things. We’ll beat the Boomers, all right.”
“I’ll bet you will! I know all about you and your pards, Young Wild West, though I never met you until now. You go ahead and clean them up. Don’t kill any of them, though, unless you have to. I hale killing.-”
“Oh, we won’t have to kill any of them. They haven’t got sand enough in them to run the risk of gelling shot.” While this conversation was taking place Esmond Dailey and Kate Gregory worn getting along nicely.
The two had taken to each other “like a pair of wood ducks,” as Cheyenne Charlie put it.
There was nothing very strange about this, for Dailey was' a good-looking young man and. had very pleasing ' manners.
And the girl was of the same stamp.
After he had walked over the two claims with him, Gregory turned to Wild and said:
“It seems that these claims am worth something, after all. But don’t buy them of Bill Spencer.’’
“Oh, don't.think we will do anything like that. I wouldn’t buy if I found out he was really the owner of the land. I would simply get oil’, that's all.”
“Well, since you have invited us to be your gnosis, 1 think we will put up our tent ami slop here with you. Wc may not stay more than a couple of days, tor t am anxious to get to Denver with my sister. I had no idea of coining here when I started out with her/’
“Well, she will be all right while she is here in Dizzy Wealth,” Wild assured him.
“Yes, I am almost certain of that. The i*1 .veur party will no doubt make it pleasant for her.”
“And Dailey will help along, I guess. ’
“What sort of a fellow is Dailey?'* asked Oregon, .».> he noticed that his sister seemed to be enjoying his company very much.
“I consider him to be a very fine fellow. He has made quite a pile of money in mining stocks, and got it in his head that he would come out here on the grounds and invest some of it in real mines. He is what you might call a very innocent tenderfoot.”
“Ah, I see. Well, I shan’t interfere with your work any longer. I am going to take a walk over to the store. Go ahead with jrour gold-digging; 1 wish you luck.”
“Oh, we don’t propose to do an awful lot of digging here. We are going to sell the claim as soon as we find that we own it. I staked it out in the name of my sweetheart over there. It is hers, providing Bill Spencer don’t own it.”
“I don’t think Bill Spencer owns it.”
So saying, Gregory walked off, leaving our hero rather puzzled as to who and what he was.
As Wild turned to join Charlie and Jim, who were washing out some dirt at the creek, he looked around and found that Hop and the German were nowhere to be seen.
He asked Arietta where they were.
“They walked over in the direction of the saloon.” was the reply. “I thought maybe you sent Hop after something.”
“I didn't send him after anything. But never mind. 1 guess he’ll be safe enough there. 1 am going over in a few minutes myself.”
It was not Jong before Dailey returned to his work.
Kale Gregory joined the girls, Wir.g got into a comfortable position under a tree and went to sleep and then the scene became one of industry and idleness combined.
“Charlie,” said Wild, aI guess there is no need of us doing much work here. Wc can sell out before long and make as much as we would if we worked, 1 think, .lust take a walk over to the saloon with me. I want to see what is going on there. Hop and the Dutchman have gone there.”
“AH right,” answered the scout, who was rather glad to quit the work of washing dirt, even if it di»l pay pretty well.
Charlie was not much of a miner, though he knew a!! about it.
Jim was satisfied to remain and keep the company of the girls, so he gave up work, too.
Then Dailey quit and came over by them, while Wild and Charlie went on to the collection of the shanljes near at hand.
When they got to the saloon they louud Hop and the German at the bar, throwing dice for drinks.
It was quite certain that the Chinaman had picked the fellow out t.o make a victim ot him, but the best ln> li;n| been able to do so far was to gel him to throw lor drinks.
Kinstein, as he said Jiis name was, re I used to make ji for money.
• Wild paid little or no atlention to them alter W. found out that, there was no money j»t .-take.
Me walked into the rear room and found Gregory there talking with Bill Spencer.
\
/
Spencer had the document he had shown Wild out on a table and was evidently bargaining to sell Gregory some land.
rfhe villain turned slightly pale when he saw the young dc-adshot and grew very uneasy.
“Going to buy some land, Mr. Gregory?” Wild asked.
“Well, I was thinking something about it,” was the reply. “This looks all right,” and he held up the paper.
“Do you think so?”
“ Yes. I guess this man owns the property all right.”
“Well, he will have to fetch better proof than that paper before I vacate.”
The boy was a little astonished at hearing Gregory talk that way, but it quickly came to him that he was but playing a part.
He did not interfere any further,*but took a seat at another table with the scout.
-Iust then Hop and the German came in.
They sat down at the same table.
The clever Chinaman looked around, and finally his eyes rested upon Hicks, who sat in a corner making out that he was interested in an old newspaper.
“.Me likee play lillee poker,” he said blandlv.
But there was no one there who cared to tackle him.
They had seen what he could do the night before in that line, and they were not willing to risk their monev.
“M»e got tee uncfe in China whattec vellv muchee smartee,” said Hop a moment later; “me allee samee likee um uncle/’
Wild knew what he was driving at.
He was going to show them one of his sleight-of-hand tricks.
Our hero nodded for him to go ahead, as he saw him look at. him questioningly.
Out came the big yellow silk handkerchief the clever Celestial always carried.
He waved it over his head to show that there was nothing in it, and then turning to the German, said :
"You holdee um handkelchief and inc puttee somet'ing velly nicee in um.”
“ Yot is dot?” asked Einstein, looking very innocent.
Hop showed him how he wanted him to hold the handkerchief.
‘‘All right,’' nodded the German, and he obliged.
“ Evelybody watehee.”
All came over closer, even to JJill Spencer.
Micks was interested, too, for he had an idea that the Chinaman was something more ihan ordinary, anyhow.
Hop jiow took a little box from under his coat and opened it
Then, much to the surprise of all hands, he let what appeared to be a. live snake drop into the handkerchief.
u Dunnerwetter!” cried Einstein, as he dropped the handkerchief und sprang to his feet. “I vos see me snakes al realty!”
“Lat nicee lillee snake,” said Hop, smiling sweetly, and
he picked it up and wrapped it in the handkerchief, while the audience stood at respectful distance.
He placed it on the table, and then looking at Spencer, he exclaimed:
“Me bettee live dollee lat um Bnake havce turned h^0 um pack of cards, allee samee!”
“What!” cried the Boomer. “Ther snake has turned into a pack of cards, you sav?”
"Lat light.”
“You’re crazy. But I won’t bet. I wouldn’t bet agi11 anything you said, ’cause you’re too smart a Chinee fur me.”
Then Hop, finding that ho was not going, to get a bet. picked up the handkerchief and a pack of cards droppe(* upon the table.
It was not much of a trick, but it surprised and please the audience just the same.
CHAPTER X.
THE SCHEME THAT FAILED.
Hop Wah did some more of his clever tricks after th®^ and the miners were greatly pleased.
But he failed to get any of them to go into a gambit game with him.
The Boomers did not appear to be as much interested as the rest of the crowd, so after a while they went ottk one or two at. a time.
The fact was that Bill Spencer had made up his nri^ that something desperate had to be done, if ho expected t° do any business in Dizzy Wealth.
He passed the word for all hands to come to his shanty as soon as it? was convenient for them to do so.
Half an hour later they were gathered there.
"Well, boys,” said the leader, "it begins ter look though we ain’t goin’ ter pan out so well here as we*vC been doin’ in other places. There’s a young galoot in the* way, an’ he is goin’ ter spile ther whole garne.”
“Why don’t, someone shoot Young Wild West, an’ ha',e done with it?” spoke up Ilieks, shaking his head bitterly* “He oughter git his medicine, anyhow, fur what he*s done.”
“Why don’t you pop him over?” asked one of the v'^ lains, looking at him and grinning.
“1 would if 1 got a good chanco,” was the reply. like ter shoot his partners, too—ther whole three of ’em once. Then there wouldn’t be no more trouble with ’erf1* “That would fie a putty good idea,” admitted Spe>icer* “But there's a big risk ter run in doin’ it. It might t>e ‘ failure jest when we thought it was all right, ver But, anyhow, I’ve got a scheme in my head which I th,J^ will work putty good. I’ve been sizin’ up things p* ^ good, an’ I’ve eornc ter ther conclusion that Young ,g WeJst has got a gal what he thinks an awful lot of.
ther one with ther reddish-yeller hair—very putty hair, I reckon—and she is sartinly a good looker.”
“We]], what does that amount ter?'' asked one of them. “It amounts ter jest this much : If we coukl mask ourselves, some of us, an' steal ther gal away an' hide her somewhere, Young Wild West would most likely go ter look fur her, wouldn't he ?”
“He sartinly would.”
“An’ he’d look fur us, too!” spoke up Croker in his shrill voice.
“He wouldn’t be s'posed ter know it was us what done it, you little fool,” corrected the leader. “We’d make oui; that we was a band of road agents, jest come in town ter niake a raid.”
“That would be easy enough ter do if ther gal woult walk out all alone somewhere.”
There was a tinge of sarcasm in the voice of the weazen faced man now.
It was evident that he took very little stock in the scheme Spencer was trying to put through.
What he said seemed to impress the rest pretty well, too. Spencer admitted that he had not figured on just how they could get the girl.
He looked out of the open door of the shanty in a thoughtful way.
4
Sti’ange things happen sometimes, and luck comes to the bad, as well as the good.
It just happened at that moment that Arietta and Kate Gregory were walking along less than a hundred yards from the shanty.
Ivate had heard how Arietta could shoot, and after a while she had coaxed her to take her out and show her how she could do it.
Arietta wanted to oblige her, so she took her rifle, and, telling the rest that they would* not go very far, she started out with fbeir guest.
The brave girl, who understood hunting so well; looket around as they left the camp, and, seeing a spot on the side of the hill that looked as though it might be a feeding ground for quail and partridge, she headed that way “When I shoot I want to bring somethiug down,” shg said. “J may shoot some quail.”
“But you have a rifle,” answered Kate, in surprise. “You surely don’t expect to shoot quail with a rifle.”
“Oh, yes, I do. I can hit one now and then.”
“Well, I can hit one now and then with a shotgun myself, but I never saw anyone use a rifle to shoot quail.”
Arietta smiled.
They walked on and had to pass within view of the shanty where the Boomers were, as we have slated.
Of course they had not the least idea that any danger lurked.
, But^even if it did. Arietta was not going to be caught in any sort of fashion.
teaching the hiII, the brave girl started in to look for something to shoot at.
It was not lo'ug before a partridge got up with a buzz and whin' that caused Kate to utter a cry of fright.
Arietta did not attempt to shoot at the bird until it was crossing an open place between the stunted trees.
Then she fired and brought it down when it was a hundred yards from her.
“My!” exclaimed Kate; “what a splendid shot?”
“Oh, that was easy,” replied Arietta. “1 would never have got the bird if it had not flown where 1 could see it. You can’t take any chances with a rifle, you know; you must have the object you want to hit covered perfectly before you fire. With a shotgun it is different, for the shot scatters, and one shot will bring down a bird if it hits him right.”
NThey hastened to the spot where the partridge had dropped, and just as they reached it a small flock of quail arose.
Crack, crack!
Arietta fired twice and dropped both birds she shot at. “Well, this is wonderful!” exclaimed Kate Gregory.
I wonder if I ooukl ever learn how to do that? Who taught you, Miss Murdock?”
Well, I suppose T taught myself how to shoot, for I haVe been at it ever since I was big enough to hold a rifle out straight. But it was Wild who taught me how to make difficult shots. Pie it? called the Champion Deadsliot of the West, you know, and if anyone could teach a person iow to shoot well, it is he.”
The girls found the birds that had fallen under the unerring aim of Young Wild West's sweetheart, and then tilery stood in a little hollow among the bushes, talking.
And creeping toward them from one direction were |three men with masks on their faces and from another one man without a mask.
The three men were Bill Spencer, Hicks and another of the Boomers.
The one man was Croker.
Croker had told Wild that he would never lift hi:- hand to do anything against him again, and when he said it he meant it.
And he also decided that he would not only not lift a hand against any of his friends either, hut that he would prevent, others from doing so, it’ it lay in his power.
The last decision was made when Bill Spencer and hi* two men started out to surprise and capture the two girl*.
“Young Wild Wojst teached me a mighty good lesson, an’ I ain’t goin' ter furgit it,” the little man muttered, as he saw the throe men start on their loul mission. “I ain’t got nothin' but jeers an' snoerv ever si nee 1 went an' got that buckskin bag. 1 was all right when I told how I had heard about ther hidiu* of ther ten thousand dollar.-', but jest because Young Wild West got on ter ther game an5 took ther money, so's ter tool us, I got ter h- no good.
I'll show Bill Spencer how good I am. ^ er kin bet your life he ain’t goin' ter git them gals in his power.”
Croker walked out of the shanty leisurely, just as though he had nothing in view whatever.
But when he got around behind it, and under the* cover! of some bushes, he started oli' straight in the direction the j two girls had gone.
The three who meant to capture them and carry them away to some hiding place were going in a roundabout way, so Croker was pretty sure that he could get there ahead, and be in time to warn them of their danger.
•‘One of ther gals has got a rifle, an’ it might be that she'll use it on 'em,” he muttered, shrugging his shoulders. “But that won’t no inore’n serve ’em right. Bill Spencer is goin’ a little too fur, I think. It’s about time lie stopped it. He made a mistake when he ordered Young Wild West ter git off ther land lie’s camped on, too. I’ve got ther map of ther land what was ter be fur them what wanted ter stake it out furminin’ purposes, an’ this is all in it. Bill has done this sort of business before, but this are ther first time he ever had Young Wild West ter deal with. I feel mighty mean ter think that I acted ther part of a sneak thief last night, an’ I m goin’ ter try an’ square myself if I can. I wouldn’t have cared if ther gang hadn’t all turned ag’in me. I’ve jest woke up, I have.”
He hurried along, and heard the shots that Arietta fired when he was yet a couple of* hundred yards from the spot where the girls were.
Once he caught a glimpse of the three men who were sneaking that wav, and when he saw that they had masks on he grinned.
“As if that game would work, anyhow!” he exclaimed under his breath. “Why, Young Wild West would surely' find out who done it, an' then there would be a funeral or two here in Dizzy Wealth Camp.”
Croker knew he must be cautious about surprising the girls, for he did not want them to cry out.
He simply wanted them to be on the. lookout and foil the plan of Spencer.
And in case they could not do it lie meant to help them. In another minute he was within a few feet of the two girls, who were standing where they had picked up the last quail Arietta had brought down.
“Ilello!*’ he called out in a shrill whisper.
The girls turned in surprise.
“Don't git scared,” said Croker as he showed himself. “I jest come ter tell yer that three galoots is sneakin’ up after yer. They want ter git yer jest ter spite Young Wild West. I’m telliir ther truth, I am. Be ready fur 'em, an’ if yer can't manage 'em alone 1*11 help ver, though I don’t want ’em ter know it, 'cause th»*v re s posed ter be my friends.”
Kate Gregory would have uttered a scream when the man first showed himself if Arietta had not placed her hand over her mouth.
Young Wild West's pretty ftweethearl was one of the cool sort. and she felt that flip woawn-facKl man wtis fell mg strietly U»o truth.
“All risrht.’' sin* answered, suiilinur at Croker, much to his surprise. <fY<m jud stay behind that rock over there,
and I’ll show you how we will attend to the three men. They are the Bomners, of course?”
Croker nodded in the affirmative.
Arietta looked around.
There was a big tree right near by, and, taking Kate by the arm, she led her to it.
“You get behind there, and don’t you get frightened,” she said, in a whisper. “That man has done us# a good turn, and I know it. I’ll make the Boomers think they have got up the wrong tree when they show themselves!
Kate was very much frightened, but the calmness of the girl with her partially allayed her fears, and she whispered that she would do just as she was told.
The next minute there was a rustle, in the bushes to the left of them.
Arietta did not appear to notice it, but she had her riAe turned that way in a hurry.
But it did not seem as though she moved it that way i°l
a purpose.	. j
“I guess we won’t get another chance to shoot,” she. sa1 to her companion, “^o we may as well go back to the camp* Yrou can carry the game, if you like.”
Just then tliTee masked men burst from the bushes.
In the twinkling of an eye Arietta had the foremost o them covered.
“Stop right where you aTe!” she exclaimed, in. a voi^ that rang through the woods. “Kate, I made a niistfl^0* when I said I wouldn’t get another chance to shoot.”
Bill Spencer and his two companions were thunde*" struck.
They certainly had not expected anything like this. Each of them had a revolver in his hand, but they stoo^ stock still and never attempted to raise them.
“I want you three scoundrels to take off your masks*’ exclaimed Arietta, calmly. “I want to see your faces. \ you don’t do it I will be compelled to shofct them off, that 9 all!”
One of them obeyed right away.
It was Hicks.
“Ah!” said the brave girl. “I thought you were Roomers? Well, I guess your time is getting pretty sho1’^ Bill Spencer gave a leap at that moment ami) lead10 the cover of the bushes.
Crang!
Arietta fired and off went his hat.	,c\\
But the villain never stopped running, and, getting " out of sight in the bushes, lie made good his escape*
The other masked villain also flew now, lor he bo"' s-e the girl was trying to get a shot at Spcncer and that him the chance.
Crang!	-i t‘1
• *i j v
Arietta turned and fired at him, but she only (ll( frighten him, and off went his hat.
“You go, too!” she said to Hicks.	bilJt $°
He started off like a hunted deer, and she le without firing at him.
CHAPTER XI. hop 'makes a little fun for the crowd.
C'roker now arose from behind the rook.
There was a broad grin on his ugly countenance. “Miss, that was tlier best I ever seen!” he declared. “They ain't no good! They’re rank frauds, from ther word go! I’ve been in with ’em fur some time now, air I’ve helped skin people by scllin’ ’em land that belonged to ther slate an* government. Jest ter show yer that 1 mean ter be straight hereafter, 111 give yer this paper, which is proof that ther land you an’ your friends is camped on ain’t owned by Bill Spencer.”
He took a rather dirty folded paper from his pocket and handed it to the girl, and then, without another word, took his departure.
Arietta opened the paper and looked it over.
She could not tell much about it, hut she was sure that the man had told the truth, so she turned to Ivate Gregory and said:	!
“Come on! we will go and look for Wild and your brother. I want Wild to know this right away. The Boomers are frauds, and the quicker they are exposed the better it will he for the innocent strangers who come here.”
“I think my brother came here for the purpose of looking for some men who were engaged in a fraudulent business of some kind,” answered Kate, timidly, acting very much as though she was telling something she ought not to.”
“Well, I am not surprised to hear that. It looked a hit suspicious when I saw a disguised man with you and your brother. That man with you is not a German greenhorn, as he pretends to be.”
“Why, how do you know?”
Kate showed how surprised she was.
“I can tell by looking at him. He wears a wig, and he doesn’t act J^ie part of a greenhorn, altogether, lie certainly did not eat like one when you all sat down to dinner in our camp.”
“I have nothing more to say just now,” was the retort. “1 suppose I have said too much already.”
“Oh, J guess you haven’t said anything that will hurt. Come on: we'll go and look for Wild.”
Kate picked up the game Arietta had shot. tor she was Hot going to leave that behind, after having seen it shot with a rifle, and the two-headed for the shanlv hotel.
It wap less than half a mile from where they wore, and r*s they got out of the woods Ihrv saw it right before them.
I ho two girls walked rapidly.
I’ho Boomers were nowhere to be seen, and neither was mu it who bad given them tlu* warning.
When they got to (he store they saw Charlie and Jina doming.
•Arietta at once called <ml to Itiern.
“Where k Wild?*’ .Jio asked, as they came up.
'“He's gone back to ther cam])," answered the scout. ‘‘We came down ter help Wing carry up something from ther store, which is needed.”
‘‘Well, I have found -out that Bill Spencer and his gang are frauds. They don’t own the land where we are camped.”
“Well, 1 thought that ever since Wild said it,” answered dim. “But how did you find out, Arietta?”
“One of Spencer's gang gave me the information. Here it is; you can understand it belter than I can, perhaps.” Jim took the map of the lands that had been set aside for mining claims and looked it over hurriedly.
A glance was sufficient to satisfy him that the girl was right.
But when she told him all that had happened in a few short minutes he looked at her in surprise.
“So it was the. weazen-faced galoot, that did you a good turn, eh?” he observed. “Well, that was real good in him. It sorts of pays up for the thieving business he did in getting hold of the bag that had the leaves and piece of paper in it.”
“That is right. I think the man should have a chance to reform.
He says he is done doing had, and I feel quite certain that he means it. Why. he was going to help us beat off the villains if 1. had not been able to do it alone.”
“The man means to do right, I am sure,” spoke up Kate Gregory.
“I heard you shooting. Arietta,” said .Tim, as he looked at. the game Kate had in her hand, “but I had no idea that you were shooting the hats off masked villains’ heads as well as quail,”
“Hurry Wing up a little, and we’ll go back to the camp. I want Wild to know what I have discovered as soon as ppssible.”
Just then John Gregory came out of the saloon and walked over to where the four were standing.
“Oh, John!” exclaimed Kate, rushing to him. “I have had an awful experience.”
“What!” cried the man, looking amazed.
“That is right. John. But it is all right now.”
She told him just, •what had happened, not omitting a single detail, while the others remained perfectly silent. ‘“Well, this is rather strange,” said Gregory, and he ooked at the German.
“ Yes, very,” canic the reply.
All eyes turned upon the man instantly, for they noticed that he did not speak in broken bnglish.
“I guess you forgot, yourself that time, Mr. I'-instein,” said Arietta, with a laugh. .
“ I vos make a leedle misLook, already,” wa.- the reply, ami then he laughed.
“Say no more,’’ said Gregory, hurriedly. ‘*1 believe we have got the very men w<- are alter. Lake. Oue thing, we know that they are frauds, am how.”
“Lot u.s uW gr> o\<*r to (lie camp hwfcthcT," .-‘poke up
Arietta. “1 want to let Wild know for certain that the Boomers are frauds.”
** All right, niiss.*’
Charlie and Jim went into the store to see how near "Wing was ready.
At that moment Hop came out of the saloon.
He had managed to get a little more tanglefoot than was good for him, and he was in a very jolly humor.
“Hoolay!” he shouted. “Me allee samee Melican man. "Me shootee allee samee stlaight, likee Young Wild West!” He pulled a big revolver from his pocket and fired a .5hot in the air.
A dozen or more miners, who were not working, crowded around, grinning in anticipation of some fun.
Then who should come along but Croker.
The little man had not gone back to his companions, but had waited around a while and then come down to ihe mining camp.
Hop knew he was one of the Boomer*, and the moment lie saw him he called out:
“Hip hi! Lillee Melican man thlow up urn hat! Mo wantee shoo tee!”
He did not expect he would do it, hut Croker was in a pretty good humor, after what had happened, and he pulled otT his hat and threw it. up right away.
Bang!
Hop fired without taking aim.
There was a jingling sound of broken glass, and then the spectators saw that the only pane of glass that was in the window of a shahty opposite had received the bullet. But Hop did not seem to think he had done any damage. He ran over and picked up the hat.
When he saw that lie had not hit it he* nodded and said: “Mi> tly nm some more, so be. Lis time me makec hole thlough urn hat!”
Placing the hat over the muzzle of his revolver, he held it over his head and pulled the trigger.
Bang!
He put a hole through it that time, surf* enough!
The revolver was one of the old-fashioned kind that load with powder and hall.
That particular chamber nutft have had an extra quantity of powder in it, for the hat was sot on fire.
There was a roar of laughter from the miners, but contrary to the expectations of the majority, Croker did not g«*t. mad.
“That’s all right.” he said. “1 reckon I’ve got money ter buy another hat/’
“If you haven’t I have." .«poke up A riel la.
Hut Hop was not done with that hat ju-t yet.
ITo picked it up. beat out the lire, and then looked at it I'tiefnily.
“Lai too muehee bad,*'’ h«* ^aid. f‘Me havee makee fixee.”
The < lc’"i* < Liiiiiiitva. up to one of his tricks1, and our friend* knew ii right awav.
Looking around, he found a stick which he carefully thrust into the yielding soil.
Then he placed the ruined hat on the end- of the stick, which was about three feet from the ground.
“Evelybody watchee,” he said, pulling out his big handkerchief. “Me fixee um hat allee samee putty quickee, so be. Me gottee uncle in China whattee velly smartee: nie allee samee likee my uncle; me velly muche smortee, too.’’ “You’re mighty smart if yer kin fix that hat so it’s fit ter wear agin,” observed Croker, with a grin.
“Evelybody watchee!” called out Hop.
Everybody did watch.
Over the hat went the handkerchief.
Then, after he had carefully wrapped the handkerchief around the ruined piece of headgear, the clever Celestial stepped back.
“My uncle in China will now fixee um hat. Me ask him and he say allee light.”
He looked up toward the sky and called out, loudly:
“My unele in China, comee and fixee um hat; no lettee somebody see, so be.”
“Allee light, Hop,” came the answer, apparently from far above the heads of the gathering.
The Chinaman was bringing his gift of ventriloquism into play.
Those who did not know this were amazed, especially Croker and the more ignorant of the miners.
"You fixee um hat, my uncle?” asked Hop, still looking upward.
“ Yes, me fixee, but me havee makec lillee difelent color, so he,” came the reply from far away.
“Allee light; lillee Melican man no care. Makee velly •< goodee hat.”	v (
“Allee light, Hop.”	'4.
Then, with a smile that was “child-like and bland," J Hop lifted the handkerchief from the hat.
“Thunderation!” gasped Croker, in his squeaky voice. t “What do yer think of that?”	.-jj
A soft hat, of a light color and in excellent condition* was resting upon the stick, the dilapidated one having vanished.
“Takee um hat,” said Hop, tossing it to the little man' “.My unele allee samee velly goodee; me «hoot nm hat an*l he makee fixee velly muehee nicee.”
Gregory applauded the cleverness of the Chinaman ^ dapping his hands, and Dailey, who had come up bcfr|1 fhis, joined' him.
The miners, most of whom were superstitious, did n°* know what to make of the proceeding.
M’hey were all positive that the Chinaman had not d<1,,r a thing to the hat.
'They had seen him place it on the end of the stick cover it with his handkerchief.
Mut it never occurred to them that when ho put ,,lt handkerchief over it he placed another hat there, ' he had taken from hi* pocket unseen by them.
It was easy for a sleight-of-hand performer, and Hop 'vas certainly a pretty good one.
“It jest fits!” declared Croker, as he put the hat on. ‘I m much obliged to yer, Mister Chinee.”
At any pther time he would have called rioji a heathen, hut now it was different.
He regarded him as something far above an ordinary Chinee.
Hop turned to go back to the saloon, but Arietta called him back.
“I guess you have had enough tanglefoot for one day,” she said. “Just help your brother fetch the articles he came to the store for. Do as I say or there will be trouble.”
“Allee light, Missy Alietta,” replied the Chinaman, meekly. ‘*Me velly goodee Chinee; me go to um Flisco Sunday-school, and me velly, velly goodee.”
Dailey and Gregory laughed heartily.
“I never knew a Chinaman could be so funny,” the latter declared.
“There are not many like this one, I guess,” the tenderfoot replied.
Hop now went in the store, and a minute later he came out with his brother.
He was carrying a sack of flour, and Wing had his arms filled with other articles.
“Have yer got everything, Wing?” asked the scout.
“Yes, Misler Charlie,” came the reply.
“All right, then. I guess we’ll go hack to the camp. Come on, everybody! We’ll tell Wild what Arietta has found out, an’ then we’ll start in an’ make it warm fur ther Boomers. Whoopee!”
As they started for the camp Arietta took the lead, the paper Croker had given her in her hand.
CHAPTER XII.
CONCLUSION.
Wild had gone hack to the camp more for the sake of giving Charlie and Jim a chance to take a walk around than anything else.
But when he found that Wing needed some stores he told them they could help him carry back what ho bought.
The boy then went over to where Charlie and Jim had been working that morning.
He was getting tired of Dizzy Wealth Camp, for there Were such a cowardly lot of villains there that he felt like getting out.
But he did not mean to go until he became satisfied tliat the land upon which they were camped did not belong to I he Boomers.
He remained there for nearly twenty minutes, and then, },s he was starting to go back to the two girls he suddenly three men coming.
One of them was Bill Spencer.
The others were a couple of his companions.
After being defeated so handily by Arietta, Spencer and his men had grown desperate.
Two of the gang were for going over and cleaning out Young Wild West's camp, but the rest only shook their heads.
They had seen too much of the dashing young deadshot and his partners to feel like trying anything of that kind.
But they all agreed to sneak up close and watch what was taking place at the camp.
When they got there, and became convinced that there was no one there but Young Wild West, and two of the girls, the two who had been in favor of cleaning out the camp were eager to begin operations.
“Do yer mean ter say that we couldn’t clean out. Young Wild West now?” asked one of them. “I don't say that we’ve got ter kill him, but a good 1113111111’ would do him a lot of good.% An’ if we was .ter destroy them tents an* things I reckon we could have a whole lot of satisfaction. If he was ter come after us with his pards we could jest §ay it was as fair fur us ter lick him as it was fur him ter lick a couple of our men. He wouldn't do 110 shootin’, unless we was ter start it. What do yer say, Bill ?*’
“All right, then,” answered Spencer. ‘‘I’ll go with yer. We’ll jest punch thunder out of ther young galoot, an’ after we git him laid out we’ll tear up ther tents an’ smash things in general. Come on! There ain't 110 use in 1 foolin' about it any longer. Young Wild West has got ter git off ther land which I claim is mine. I reckon ther miners here will bear us out on that p’int.”
There were only two of them who were willing to go with him, so with an oath on his lips, Bill Spencer started boldly with them for the spot where Young Wild West was standing.
Spencer knew he was in for it now, so he put on a bold front and made up his mind to keejT right at it.
“Well, yer ain't moved yet, I see,” he said, as he walked up.
“That’s right,” answered Wild, coolly.
“Well, we’ve come ter tell yer that if yer ain't off this land inside of half an hour we’ll have ter pick yer up air throw yer oil*. That's plain talk, but if? got ter he did. What’s mine ain't yours. You ain't got no right here, so you’ve got ter go by force, if yer won't go no other way.
“Is that so? Well, we are not going to go away from here till we get good and ready. We are not ready yet.”
“Well, we’ll make you go right now! An we won r use nothin’ lmt our hands ter do it. It- ain t tur us ter go ter shootin* anyone, like vou seem so ready ter do. So long as you don't pull a uun wo won t. Hut if yer do veil jest defend ourselves, that's all! ’	^
“So you want to tackle me and put me off this claim, without using anything hut. the weapons- that Nature provider! you with, do yon?" he said. “Well, come on. th.11! You waited until v.»u saw I wn< alone here, too. 11. y. there, girls! Ju^t riin down to the store and fetch Ch..r!>
and .Jim here, will you? There is going to be some fun!” Then Spencer and his two companions ran forward to grab the boy.
Spat!
Wild hit Spencer between the eyes and sent him rolling on the ground.
But one of the others grabbed him around the legs and threw him before lie could get clear of him.
But getting Young Wild West down was not keeping him there.
Up went his feet, and catching them squarely in his stomach, the third man, who had been in the act of throwing himself upon the boy, uttered a gasp and fell over backward.
W ild was upon his feet in a jiffy.
Biff!
Jle hit the other fellow on the neck and sent him rolling.
♦
At thi> juncture another of the Boomers came running to the scene.
At the same time Spencer got upon his feet and was ready to renew the conflict
Anna and Eloise had started on a run for the store 1o get help.
But Wild did not seem to be much worried.
Bill'! Spa l! Whack!
The young dead-hot was on his mettle now, and lie was making ten-ping of th<- four Banners.
The first galoot that pulls a v. ill be a dead man I” he .shouted. This is a fjuht with hands and feet, and if T don’t come pretty close i0 giving you what you’re looking for Til miss my calculation!"
ioung Wild West was having a lively lime of it with the Boomers, when a shout, ran^ out. and Arietta came in view, followed by a crowd.
“I've got the proof, Wild!” shouted the girl. “They are frauds!”
Spence%had picked up a short stick, and was in the act of striking the boy as the hhout rang out.
Another of the villains had hold of him from behind.
Wild caught, the leader of the Boomers by the throat, and kicked out at the same time.
Down went the man behind him, while Spencer dropped the stick and gave a gasp.
He tried to get away, but it was no go.
“The rest ean run if they feel like it, hut you can't!” exclaimed the dashing young doad.-hot'. who had escaped
with verv few bruises.
The other three did run. mid-joining their companions,
made JV»r the shanties below.
Wild saw Charlie act as though he wa» going to open
fire on them, .-:o he called out:	.
k.s i i- . t. •	clinotinw cowards. 1 liev
Don I. f h;irli<*! Jt is no use M snooim^,
did not offer to shoot me.”
Arietta was delighted when she saw ll0r (1:lfilnn- •Vo1,n-lover was not hurl.
“Here’s the map of this land. Wild” *1>e said, as Jim
Dart was tying Spencers hands behind him. ‘‘It don't belong to that villain, and it never did!”
“That is quite right!” said Einstein, the German—or the make-believe German, tearing off a frowsy wig and stepping forward. "Bill Spencer, you are my prisoner. I am a government detective. I have been looking for you for months. You are wanted for counterfeiting United States money, as well as swindling innocent people by selling them land that never belonged to you.”
Gregory now stepped up.
“Young Wild West,” said he, "I have been deceiving you a little, but I thought it was the best tiling to do until things got just right. I did not want to interfere with the detective, who thought that Spencer was the man he wanted, but was hot sure. He just found out that he was the right man from the little man who warned the girls ft little while ago. Now everything is all right. I am T. H. Harley, and I never signed the paper Spencer has been showing.”
This was a genuine surprise.	1
But Young Wild West and his friends were used to surprises of all kinds.
Of course, there was a wdiole lot that had to be said before they all thoroughly understood each other, but when they did it was as plain as day, so Charlie declared.
Bill Spencer admitted right then and there that he was the man the detective had been after so long, and he also admitted that he had been practicing a fraudulent land scheme for over a year.
The detective took him in charge, and the next day he was taken away from Dizzy Wealth Camp, never to return, for he was just old enough to make his term in prison about wind up his days on earth.
Through the interference of Wild the rest of the Boomers were not arrested, but they were given an hour to get out of the mining camp.
That same afternoon Wild and Dailey sold the two claims, for they had no use for them.
Dailey left the camp in the company of Harley, alias Gregory, and his sister, and Cheyenne Charlie remarked, as they bade them good-by, “that there would be a wed-diu’ in tber near future.”
Whether* there was or not our friends did not hear.
But Young Wild West had beaten the Boomers all right, and it was Arietta who had exposed the fraud just at the right time.
THE END.
