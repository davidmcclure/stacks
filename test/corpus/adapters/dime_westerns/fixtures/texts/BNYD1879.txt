CHAPTER L
MISSOURI C. SMITH.
■B1 Bank full and rising. ”
KA broad and mighty river now,, the yellow ^Kansas, In^hin^ the crumbling banks with its ■Klees, surging waves, and every now and then Hjng off a slice of earth and carrying it on-PBmtoward the aea, entombed in lte mighty
feStnithville Landing—«ix o’clock on on April 'morning, and a horse and rider come galloping down to the river.
|g A noble pair that horse and rider, t The horse, a cream-colored mustang, curious-Syfleeked with patches of black; the rider, a Bwtng and beautiful girl who sat on the steed ■ke a very prairie queen.
8 She was tall in stature, straight and slender, $jftt supple and willowy in her build; her face, Kperbly beautiful, the features clearly cut, and
perfect in their outlines; the complexion rich in its olive, sun-warmed tint: the Hkin so thin that the warm blood could be clearly discerned beneath. Her jet black hair—fine as finest silk, nnr) so luxuriantin its growth, that, loose, it descended to her waist—was brushed carelessly back from her forehead, and gathered in a single knot behind, fastened by a little golden dagger, Her eyes, black as the hair, were large, full and brilliant—eyes that could melt into liquid softness when her heart was moved to pleasure, or could flash with angry fires when passion beat swelled within her veins. The low,
yet broad forehead, the little rose-bud Ilk* mouth, with ita full, dewy lips and pearly white teeth; the proud, Imperious chin—afi went niatchless.
No Eastern monarch, with senses charmed by the subtle drugs, and imagination roused by tbs strangd, mystic perfumes of "Farther Ind," dreaming of the paradise to come beyon4 tli» tomb, ever saw a sweeter face than that of the Arkansas girl, Missouri C. Smith, sole child of General Leonidas Washington Smith, direct an<$ only descendant of “the Smith” who. a hundred vaars before, founded Smithville, at
the Arkansas, a mile dr so above the outlet, of the sluggish ersek, known as Catfish Bayoi.
The giri was attired ij»a dpk-green riding-habit, rad on h«C head she w»n * black Tel ret hat, from which a little white plume curled down, nestling against the silken hair.
At the levee she turned to the left and cantered off dowa tho river road.
In Just about a minute she left the metropolis of 8mithrills behind; It was mot as large as Memphis or even Fort Smith.
frown by the plantations, past the magnolia trees, with their dark-green wax-like leave* and white blossoms, so rich in svreet incense, and in among the tall clumpe of cotton* wood, which announced the neighborhood of Catfish Bayou, ahe rode, aud at testrhalted on the little point of land between the two streams.
Usually then was quite a difference between th. yellow current of the Arkansas on one side, and the black waters of the Bayou on the other; but now the back water of the river had forced Its way up the mouth of the creek, completely swallowingtbe current of the Catfish, and extinguishing it
On the very extremity of the point of land was a huge cottonwood tree, which had been struck and killed by lightning.
Generally it was some ten or fifteen feet from the tree to the water, but now the turbid tide washed within a foot of tie tree-trunk.	,
_ JU the girl sat in the saddle and gazed out upon the sur-; i»ce of the water rushing so steadily onward, and -splashing Up against the shelving banks with many a hoarse and menacing sound, she felt a strong impulse to dismount, and, from the base of the blasted cottonwood, watch the splash and ripple of the surging tide, which was hurrying onward toward It* doom like a living, guilty thing.
Down from the saddle, light as a bird, the girl dismounted. *0 need to fasten the rein of the mustang. Mustard was too well-bred to move from the spot where his mistress had left
him
Gathering up the long skirt of her riding-dress in her hand, with light, springy steps, that told of perfect health, and of every muscle in true play, the girl proceeded to the very extremity of the point of lead, where on either side the angry waters seemed to threaten the lonely tree.
Leaning against the cottonwood, jwhi*' inclined over th^ stream, Missouri, with a careless motloi), dipped the lash of her little ridlng-whip into the river, and whisked the glistening drops here and there in the sunlight, like a score of' pol-jflhfld diamonds.
And as the girl leaned against the tree-trunk, idly lashing the surface of the water, and watching the glittering drops as they went swiftly through the air, and then sought again the parent stream, old-time memories came back to her. Sew minds, watching the mad current of a great river, rushing restlessly pa, or the surf of old ocean beating in on the rocks, *>r beach, with its restless waves, but will give way to sad reflections.
And before the face of the girl, Missouri, rate the image of the handsome young Southern officer, who had won her girlish heart, pot the gage of love, the betrothal ring, upon her finger; and then, a month afterward, had fallen by a re> volver-shot flred by one of Merrell’s Light-Home, when the Yankee General, Steele, rode into Little Bock, after the skirmish at Bayoa Fouche.
About five yean had passed since that had happened; the war had ended, and she had even danced with one of the Union officers. And now, as she gazed listlessly upon the yellow waters, die reflected how greatly she bad changed in a few short years. Only fifteen at the time of her lover’s death, die M thought life lost all its	and
nightly went to sleep praying that she might die, and thus meet her bethrothed beyond the tomb. But death doee not come for wishing, and as year succeeded year, and the girl ripened into womanhood, little by little she forgot the grief, and ike memory of her early love faded slowly away.
' And now, as she gated vacantly down upon the turbid waters, she caught herself wondering if die should have been happy had her lover lived, and if she would really have married him if the Yankee bullet had not so suddenly cot short Us life.
And then a frown came over her handsome face as abe lashed the skirt of her habit impatiently with the whip, and strove to banish the ugly thoughts from her mind, and to ■till remain kal aad true to the memory of tiw dead love.
Pressing hsr hand against her brows, she half dosed her heavily afrit* the trunk of the blasted
For full five minutes die remained motionless, striving, be* in v^n, to recall the old-time memories and to banish thr thoughts which whispered that possibly in the futon she would meet a man whom abe would like ten times better thee
the old
Angry at the thought, she started, and resting her hand against the tree, prepared to return to the mustang-, who war lazily cropping the fresh young spring grass, aane fifty pace* off.	_.
But the spirits of the yellow flood had marked the fait young girl for their prey, and, wbile.she had bein-neditatlng with half-shut eyes, by the tree trunk, the sapping current of the river had cut a channel beneath the bank under her feet, and as she turned to go, the weight of her tread, light as i was, completed the work.
She felt a sudden tremulous motion beneath her feet Bhf comprehended the danger, and strove to flee.
Too late.'
Ten feet of solid earth, the entire extremity of the point bearing the blasted cottonwood and the fieah young giri 01 its surface, slid into the river.
Around the slight flgun of the girl, and the tossing trunk of the old tree, foamed the yellow waters. The solid earth, which had but a moment before sustained the two, ha4 melted into nothing within the embrace of the flood, as though touched by the wand of an enchanter.
Sucked under by the treacherous current of the Arkansas the girl for a moment disappeared beneath the wave. But Missouri had ran presence of mind, and knew enough wbe> the turbid water blinded her eyes to keep her mouth sfiut, and to strike out vigorously with both hands and feet.
In a second, although it seemed five minutes at least to her, she rose again to the surface. The tree-trunk floating serenely on the bosom of the flood, was only some five feet from her With a desperate effort she managed to paddle her way tefc and clutch a branch of the tree, within a foot of the trunk.
" If I ever get out, I’ll learn to swim!" the girl exclaimed, as she sputtered the water out of her mouth.
The envious wave had loosened the fastenings of her hair, and the coal-black locks wen streaming down wildly ove* her shoulders, and floating on the surface of the turbid river that idly tossed them up and down, caressing the silken haix with many a little wavelet
Down the Arkansas, past Catfish Bayou, home on the sui face of the rushing tide, went the cottonwood and the gin clinging to it
Three or tour times Missouri had attempted to climb up on the tree, and each time the trunk had rolled over, yielding to her weight, and ducked her over head and ears in the water.
Finally giving up the attempt, abe contented herself witb simply clinging to the log, trusting that, by some eddy In the current, the tree-trunk would be carried in to the bank, and thus afford her a chance to escape.
Just below when the bayou came Into the Arkansas tht river made a sharp turn to the left, and Missouri, who knew the river for ten wiles up and down from Smithville as well as any pilot, hoped that, once past the bend, the current would carry her and her huge life-preserver in near to the shore.
Around the point swept the tree and Its living burden, and. as Missouri had expected, she came nearer to the bank, but was yet some twenty feet from It To leave the tree, then, and attempt to gain the shore, would only result in her finding a grave beneath the yellow wave.
u Oh, dearr cried the girl, disconsolatdy, “it’s three miles to the Ozark place, and I shall die before I get down then, I know.”
But, hardly had the words left her llpe, when sharp on the fresh morning air rung the hoof-stnkes of a horse, apparently coming up the river road.
A cry of Joy came from Missouri's llpe as, with eager eara, she caught the sound; and soon a horseman emerged from • dump of trees which masked the road beyond.
Just a single glanoe, and the face and flgun of the stranger wen photographed forever on the maiden’s mseaory, He was within a hundred feet of her, and had rained to hi* horse so abruptly at sight of the giri that the aalmd was forced beck almost upon his haunches, with his head forced up in the air by the end pressure of the heavy Mexican bit, jnsi ss if the hArse sad rider wen “ poeing" for the purpose of affording some rising young backwoods artist a model for an equestrian statue, to be done to marble at the expense of
•	grateful republic, which lota its heroes starve while living and theatres them a magnificent bnrid sad a statre wfcaa
And Missouri, a true American girt, first thought What a splendid-looking fellow the stranger was, and then what a decided disadvantage she labored under at that moment la regard tO her personal appearance!
The rider was a tall, handsome young fellow, broad-shouldered and muscular in build, and' yet not clumsily. “ put together,** *dt extremely well proportioned. Hi* face was the long oral, Italian-like one, so common to the men of the South-west; cheek-bones as high as an Indian’s, sallow complexion, thin mustache and “ goatee,” of a sandy yellow, ai was also the long hair which came down over his ears,
" clubbed ** in true South-western style. His eyes, dart-brown in color, possessed the remarkable property of ap pearing to be jet-black, a dozen paces off. The stranger was oddly attired in a" blanket-coat ” made of a red army blanket, the black stripes of which had been so arranged in the cutting of the garment that they served as an ornamei/ V) the skirts; a pair of butternut-colored pantaloons—evi dently of homespun stuff—tucked into a pair of high riding boots; a white shirt, the linen bosom of which was curious-ly frilled and ruffled; and over his brows a broad-brimmed black felt hat—of the Mexican sombrero pattern—was pulled. A leather belt girded his waist, and as the wind swayed back the folds of the coat-skirts, the butts of a pair of re. rolvers, navy-size, and the silver-mounted hilt of a twe> re-inch bowie, were plainly visible.
Just a single glance at the solitary horseman, and Missouri felt convinced that she should never forget the appearance of the young stranger, so utterly unlike any one that sb^ had ever seen.
Already, in imagination, the stranger’s strong arm bad rescued her from the yellow flood; and for such a servire there could be but one recompense—herself I	(
In just about two seconds, Missouri, proud, high-spirited Southern girl as she was, came to the deliberate conclusion that the horseman was the most noble-looking mrn she had ever seen, and that, for the first time in her life, she really was In lore, and that the early passion which had seemed to her to be so strong and lasting was but a girlish fancy.
But, amid all these conflicting thoughts, she could not help thinking what a disgraceful appearance she would present when she got out of the water, and the thought came to her that the stranger would not think ahe was pretty, with her hair hanging down, all wet and tangled around her neck, and her clothing clinging to her, drowned-rat fashion.
Just a second the horseman gazed in astonishment; then he dismounted, came to the edge of the bank, and looked up the strum toward the girl	)
“ 8avb me I" exclaimed Missouri, as she floated on, coming nearer and nearer to where the stranger stood. As she spoke she had involuntarily striven to lift herself out of the water, and the consequence was that the tre e-trunk rolled over and soused her under the treacherous element, from which, after a moment, she emerged, sputtering like a very mermaid.
When she had fairly get the water out of her eyes, and glanced at the shore, to her utter horror and rage she detected a broad grin on the face of the stranger. The ducking she h#d so abruptly received had struck him as being funny!
“ The big brute T Between the little white teeth, clenched firmly together, came the expression, and in one little Instant her opinion of the horseman changed, and in her mind came the wild wish that he would mount his ugly, claybank •teed and gallop on, leaving her to her fate.
" Look out—catch I”
Despite her indignation, Missouri could not refrain from •ooklng (gain at the stranger, at the warning command. The horseman had taken a leather cord, which had been hanging on the horn of his saddle, and as she turned her head toward him he whirled a coil of - it through the air, retaining one end of the line in his hand. The girl recognized the Mexican lasso at once, although it was the first time that «he ted ever seen the world-renowned weapon
Thrown with the skill which long practice on the plains st Texas had given to the horseman, the loop of the lasso me coiling down around the maiden’s neck.
“Can you hold on with your hands while I pull yon to shore f* ha asked, speaking as coolly as though ft was the fife of a pig that was aft stake rather than that of a human
“Yes." ntn mu eomsthlnt In the tons of her toios
lasso, which ahe had removed from her neck, and the other
stm clutching the tree-trunk, felt.half tempted, as ahe seat that smile, to drop the leather cord and trust to the log to sustain her until some one else should come to ha rescue. But, beginning to feel -chilled by remaining to long in the water, she swallowed her resentment, and quitting her hold of the cottonwood, she grasped the leather oord with both-, hands, while the stranger drew her, not over-gently, to the bank, and then pulled her out on dry land once more.
Out of breath from her rapid transit through the yellow ffood, Missouri was unable to stand, and was per fore* obliged to accept the proffered support of the horseman's arm.
But as her breath and strength came slowly back to her, and she withdrew herself from the stranger's embrace with the air of a tragedy queen, the unfeeling horseman completely spoiled all the romance by observing tersely that she looked like a drowned rat
Missouri w« just preparing to thank the man for his timely service, nut after such a remark she felt that words of thanks would have choked her.
“ Quite a bad situation for you, maim,” the horseman added, as the girl turned half-away from him, wringing the water out of the tangled masses of the superb hair.
This was adding insult to injury; and the girl mentally observed to herself that the man must bo a natural bee* Idiot not to perceive at a glance that she was a “ miss " serf not a f' inarm. ”
Then the stranger, with his honest, big brown eyee, It# ed curiously at the glrL The wet garments, clinging tight to her, betrayed the rounded perfections of her well-nigh perfect form, and Missouri, happening to turn her head as she coiled the hair up in a knot as it had been before and plunged the golden dagger through it, caught the stranger’s glance of admiration. The hot blood rushed into her face, and she blushed from the roots of the coal-black hair that fringed her forehead clear down to the back of her neck
And the stranger, on Ms part, finding himself detected, colored up guiltily, and, turning away, hid his confusion by adjusting the lassb again on the horn of the saddle.
“ Tk» fellow has some sense,” muttered the girt, as shn stooped down and wrung the water out of the skirt of hst dress.
When she rose to her feet, the stranger was standing If his horse, with his arm resting on the saddle, and regarding her with a stolid face.
Mlssburi had now come to the conclusion that she ought to smother her dislike for the fellow and thank him for his timely aid, although it was difficult to do so in a proper m^J ner, so strangely had the horseman Irritated her by his offhand, careless manner.
“ I am very much obliged to you, sir, for the service yon have done me,” she said.
The words were well enough, but even she herself was conscious that there was a stiffness and a formality about her manner that suited but 111 with the Bentlment of gratitude which ahe should feel to the man who had possibly saved her life.
“Don’t speak of It, marmi" the horseman exclaimed, ha his careless way, that was so extremely offensive to the girt. “ I kinder hesitated for a moment because I hadn’t been Introduced to you, and I thought maybe that you would object to a fellow’s scraping acquaintance with you in such an extremely unceremonious way.”
Missouri, not lacking in discernment, with all her pride and haughtiness, instantly came to the conclusion that the stranger was laughing at her in a quiet way and the thought nettled her.
“ Fm sorry that you didn’t wait, then, and follow an down the bank until you came across some one who could have introduced us,” she rejoined, quickly, a smile oa her face that intimated she was paying the stranger back in his own coin.
The horseman laughed but replied not. Ha was evidently pleased with the retort
“ And that your mind may be easy, TO introduce myteU to yon at once,1* ahe continued. “ My name is -Missouri Q Smith, and I am the daughter ot General L W. Smith.”
“ General Leonidas Smith, who wss colonel of the Tenth Arkansas at Fen Ridger the stranger asked, evidently s»
sir,” Missouri replisd; “and now wrl hsweths honor of knowing tbs nsass ef ths gentleman to who* 1 Ml Indebted for my liler
v It was ■ simple bat very natural. question under the circumstances, and yet the trow of the stranger clouded up and fee was evidently perplexed.
1 lie girl'noticed liis embarrassment in amazement “ Why, Miss,’'*Jia said, slowly—lie had dropped \b«
“ mann,” much to the girl’s relief—“ I don’t see why you ikmfrl can to know who 1 am.”
"Only* simple wish to know the name of the man to / whom I owe my Ufe,’’ she replied, “ and 1 am sure that you wiU not refuse auch a small request’’
•	" You mijriit coll me the man from Texas," he said, with a laugh ( ” tlint would cover the ground, you*now, for that’s where I come from.”
" I couldn't very well introduce you to my fauei by such a name as that,” she.remarked,.and as she spoke she looked him fuii in the face with her big black eyes, as if seeking to reail there the reason why he was reluctant to give his name.
" Of course, Miss, I was” only joking," he said, avoiding her glance; “ there's no reason why I shouldn't give my name. It’s Francis Winnie.”	9
“ Any relation to Lieutenant Winnie, of tile United State* army?" the girl asked, quickly, and evidently not a little astonished.
Again the mui seemed confused, but after a moment replied that he did not think that he was a relative of that sfflcer.
“ I kt.ow the lieutenant; he’s in Smlthvillc,” she said.
“ la he?” the man said, absently, and then, after, a moment, continued: “ If you are General Smith’s daughter, perhaps you can tell me whether he’s got an overseer yet on his place.”
“ No, air,” the girl answered.
“ Well, I'm glad ol that!" he said, “ because I’ve come on purpose to apply for the place; and I hope, Miss, that you'll put in a good word for me.”
" My father is not at home at present,” she answered;
“ bi. is at Little Rock, but will come on the first boat”
Then the handsome fellow who had saved her life was only an overseer? The keen eyes of The-Man-from-Texas detected the instant change in her manner, and he shrewdly goened the cause.
“ Be up on the first boat, eh?" be observed, thoughtfully;
** well, I suppose I can wait. Would you be so good, Miss, an to toll me where I would be apt to find accommodation sntll your father comes? I ain’t particular, you know—any -a'cv of a roosting-place will do.”
Missouri, accustomed though she was to hearing the rude phrases of the border, felt that her sensibilities were terribly outraged by the free and careless speech of the handsome Houetnan, and in her own. mind set him down at once as *>eicg the greatest boor she had ever seen. But for the un-*ortuoate termination of the stranger’s speech she would instantly have replied that the door of her father’s mansion always itood open to receive the stranger guest, and that the General,
•	her father, would have regarded it as an insult if any (hanger should pass his house without partaking of his hospitality; but now, for the first time in her life, she felt a reluctance to,tender the courtesy of a welcome beneath her /ailH-r’s roof .tree. -.Anil if she had been called upon to give her reasons for the dislike, to the man who really had a great claim 'upon her gratitude, she could only Jiave defended her conduct by saying that the horseman didn’t “ speak nice.”
After hesitating for a moment, she replied that perhaps he oould get accommodations at the Adair Place, up the bayou.
“ Who is this Mister Adair?” the horseman asked; “ not ofe of your grand folks, I hope. I don’t like these folks that put on style. I’m a right plain man, myself, you see.” Missouri began to think the man was doing every thing in his power to make her hate him, and with an effort she restrained the impulse to tell him that be was tery plain, indeed; but,-conqueringherself, she replied, simply:
« '*“ Mr. Aduir has wdy a. little, place, about twenty acres, and Is more liuntcr than planter; air the folks about here call tterSwapping GoL Ufa first name.ls, Gol lah, and'‘they say that he would rather trade by swapping than eat Bo you -■eajr-Hue** what Mfrt.ofjk Rprs«a,bo i&V. -	- ...

*» With-plvn/nlre. si*, ^-rlt’s about half; a mile up the baycu from where the roa-i crosses. The terry is on his place.”
Miss, if■ jtoo'll. just; mount my horse, I'll be happy mufeadulw criUet^oyou to..carry,.ypu .homo." s
“ I'm Biuch obliged to. you, air,” Mi»£<url said^.witb stately
courtesy, “but my own horse Is Just on the other sidetht biiyou, whore the bank caved In with mo.”	(
" Better get on and ride to him then, Miai; tbat is if yc* can ride on my saddle.”	.
‘ I never saw saddle yet .that I couldn’t ride onl" replied the girl, quickly, her dark eyes Hashing.
“ Well, Miss, I reckon now you’re a learer!” the Norseman said, with a sober face, but there was a twinkle In iua »>e» which betrayed suppressed merriment
Missouri was extremely annoyed at the coarse remark, and quietly proceeded to get on the stranger’s horse without re-plying.
In the saddle she spoke:
“ I’U show you the way, sir," and giving the mustang his bead, sho proceeded onward while the stranger followed be hind, his face lit up with a smile and the look in his eysa plainly revealing how much he admired-the girl who sat la the saddle sideways, and rode the “ clay-bank ” with an ease and grace,that a Comanche warrior or a circus queen wou!4 have envied.
' The road bent abruptly to the right on coming near U.a bayou, and followed the stream up about hail a mile; then, taking advantage of a hollow in the ban'.:, swooped dc»n to the bayou and ascended again on the ether side.
A rude scow, large enough to support a good-sized *&goa with aNrope attached to each end, and two long poles lying in It, served as a means to cross the stream This wrs th« ferry. ^
On a scrub oak to which one of thi. rope* was attached, was a rudely-painted sign, wnich read:
“ CATFISH FKRRY.
" 25 cents. Put tlie money in the knot-hole underneath.
^	“ Ool Adair."
“ The knot-hole underneath,” referred to by the sign, was a small cavity in the tree-trunk about as big as a man's fist The interior of the trunk evidently was hollow.
The horseman read the sign and looked astonished.
“ Well, this beats mcf he exclaimed; “ how does the mas get the money out of the tree?"
“ lie has a pet squirrel,” explained the girl, “ that has been taught to go after it lie only has six or soven crossing the ferry a week, and lie says it’s worth more than h brings to look after tlie ferry, so he arranged liis ‘ bank ’— the tree is his bank—and now the ferry takes care of itself.” The horseman deposited a silver quarter in Gol Adair’s “bank,” and then poled himself, the girl and the horse over the stream, which was only fifty feet wide.
“ We have solid stufT down in Texas,” he said, referring t* the silver; “ we don’t take much stock in rags."
On the other side of the stream, the girl pointed to a little path leading through a tangled mass of'blackborry bushes to the thicket which fringed both sides of the bayou abpve th« ferry.
“ That path leads to Mr. Adair’s cabin,” sbe said; “ it is only a hundred yards or so through the bush and then you’ll jome to liis elearinjt.”
Then tho girl jumped lightly down from the horse.
“ If your horse I? down, at the point, suppose you wait here, Miss, while I go and patch him for you,” suggested her escort, and then, without waiting for reply, he ISaped itjto the saddle and dashed ofl at a rate of spceu which caused the girl to look after him with admiring eyes.
Seating herself upon a fallen tree, she tried to ans!yze her feelings toward this certainly very handsome stranger.
“I hate bin- one.minute and I admire him the nertt” she reflected, petulantly. "I really think the fellow has bewitched me! 1 m sure that I shan’t say any thing in his favor to father, although I suppose of course that X shall have to tell how he saved me front a .lingering death 1 wish it had been Gol Adair or even Will Fayette; I late to feel under an obljgatign to this unknown man. He’s impudent enough for any thing, and I really believe lie makes those coarse remark? just tq annoy me. To be pure, nearly all the men rotind.horc talk th^ same.wfjr, but somehow, file ugljr,sUM?g never,«;emed tQ grpte on my, cars until noWj Oft, dear! I wish he’d go away. I can't be^r the thought of his being father’s overseer,,".	fc* .'./. .	£
And by .the time tfcft Missouri, had r^achedTJtJiis point lit her reflections, Tlie-Man'from-Texae was back,' leading (ha spotted jjnuetaug, Mustard,,, by. tb^ bridl^,’
“ It’s a pretty beast, Miss,” be said, as he dismounted, and offered his. ghoulder to assist the girl |io jnount}. but she pr»-tended .not, to perceive his lntentioi^'gnd, despite her lonjj •u. w , , and L heavy, as. it
And then, m the tightened the reins in her hand, she burned her head and looked the horseman full in the race (c a’moment, with a very sober expression on her features.
. V Mr. W innie ".—she began.
That,ain’t iny namel" 1» exclaimed, abruptly; “I was •nlyjoklng. My name is, Texas—Francis Texas.”
-	‘ Well, Mr. Texas then," Missouri continued, never ap-yarfntljr heeding the fact that he had given a false name, “ you bave placed me under a deep obligation, and—and I don’t like to be in debt to any one. Can’t 1 pay you In some way so that 1 cat} feel free again?”
i, The-Man-fi om-Texas looked her straight in the eye* for a moment, and lie too looked quite sober, almost sad. Mis* •Vi nover flinched from his gaze.
“Yea, you can pay mo,” he said; “bend dowp your

She obeyed, instantly, and he,, standing close by tho s'-rto -<Lib* mustang,.pasped his arm around her neck as if to whisper in her. ear, and. then, with a sudden movement, pressed a long, passionate kiss upon the full red lipa of the
Her face flushed crimson, and a* he released her she swayed bacit unsteadily to her former position in the saddles Her features trembled convulsively, and she pressed her hand apon her heart as though stridden by a sudden pain. A tong, deep breath came from between the parted lips and the brilliant black eyes were suffused with tears.
,. •“ There, you have paid yourself, and we are even now,” abo said, in a low and faltering voice, while her bosom rose and fell like the swelling billows of old ocean. “ Remember, I do not owe you any thing now.”
A. single pull at the rein and Mustard went dashing up the toad at headlong speed.	,
OHAPTER II.
BLACI-JACX SWAMP.
Catfish Bayou was only some five miles In length, and look its rise in an enormous swamp covering a thousand acres «r more. Huge brakes of cane, gigantic cypress trees, the roots covered by the black and almost stagnant water, tall, •iraight “ gums," high sycamores and the tangled “ underbrush ’’ of low-growing shrubs, Interlaced with creeping vines, formed the interior of the swamp. It was generally known a* Black-Jack Swajip, so named for the number of blackjack trees that grew on its edges. In the center of the wilderness was quite a large lagoon; black and ink-like were its -.atura. Two or three small islands, fifty to a hundred feet ?rc>n the shores, were in the center of the lagoon. The islands were barely a foot above the surface of the water, and were but Xittle more than a mass of tangled vegetation, except ttie largest .one, from the center of which rose a clufnp of
•	V..ge cypress trees. The edge of this island was fringed by v tic-ary growth of cane, apparently almost stout enough to forru a barrier to a bear.
<!, Few birds or beasts sought Black-Jack Swamp for a refuge. Once in a while, a stray bear would take up his home •mid the cane, but the wily ’possum and barred coo a were couKtant Inhabitants of tht. tall gum trees which grew on the borders of the great slough.
Th^. negroes in theh midnight bunts often roamed through Vhi bordui* of the “ slash,” but rarely attempted to penetrate Into it as^far as the borders of the lagoon. The dal] and gloomy waters, overshadowed by the giant branches of the cypress, stiuck awe even to the cheerful Souls of the blacks; and then, too, superstition had been at work and had peopled fl)e inturioi of ^he swamp with hobgoblins and ghosts too .frightful, to .mention.
It was about five miles from the edge of the rwunp to Smlthville landing. .It was all a low prairie until within about A,*iUe cifrithe Arkansas, where it met the ridge which formed _the bank of the river. This prairie was covered CO*nt, rank , grass, with hei^ftnd there a fringe of blackberry bushes, encircling a clump of scroggy timber.
Just as the »un commenced to rink in the west, on the afternoon Of the-day when Missouri iiad met the stranger a* letailed In our last . chapter, a young man, with a double-Mrreled shot-gun carried In the hollow of his arm, was croa» the pralrie And proceeding directly toward the swauip.
He was apparently about twpnty-slx or seven years old, •f medium size. rouud fucc, smoothly ahaven, florid com-
plexion, reddish-brown hair, blue' eyes, rather snail, and shifting and uucertalaln their gaze. He was neatly dr«4e<t -In a dark-gray business suit, although he now wore a pkijr . of high boots ud had a broad-brimmed felt hat pulled down over hla eyes. ,	^
He was called William Fayette, son of Robert Fayette, who, before the war, was one of the leading bankers' ik tbs State of Arkansas; bu^ having cast his fortunes witb th* South, be suffered thereby a loss of nearly all Ids property. The war ended, he had settled down on. a plantation he,had managed to retain, at Smithville; and, besides, had established a small banking business at the landing.
Theson-bnd neither followed his father south nor gone lntqlhe Southern 'army, but had contrived, in some mysterious way, to escape the rigid conscription and remain" at home, apparently without taking sides with either party. t It was rumored that young Fayette had really been conpernejl with the guerrilla band led by the famous partisan leader) Tell Ozark, and had acted as a secret agent for the South. “ This, however, was but idle rumor, snd *hen the autboi ity of tho United. States bad been re-established In Arkansas and the civil government reorganized, William Fayette gav« In his adherence to the ruling party, and received in revtrt for .his services the United State* assessorship of ihe district	• , 1 ^ The knowing ones shook their heads and Intimated theft belief that Bill Fayette knew which side bis bread was buttered on; knd as his father (who was a strong “ Southern-rights man " still) and himself were partners in the banking business, and lived In the same house, It was more than probable that father and son perfectly understood each other.
As Fayette entered the swamp, he cast a hasty glance behind him, as if to detect if a watch hmi been put upon him, but not a single living object was in sight
Once inside the shadows of the trees, Fayette, who apparently was well acquainted with tb« way, as he went straight on without the least hesitation, struck into a little path leading, with many • winding turn, into the center of th«
“ slash.”.
The way seemed like* the path usually made by the alligators passing frv,m one pool to another; but as It was tot far north for those scaly monsters, it was probably • bear’s track.
It was very apparent that Fayette was not in search of game, though he did carry a gun, for he went straight on, looking netthw to the right nor left, until he halted on ths edge of tho lagoon, In the center of the swamp.
Putting a whistle to his lips, he blew a shrill blast upon ft. Then he sat down on one of the roots of the hugs cypress, which grew on the borders of the dark pool, and waited.
In a few minutes he heard a crashing amid the cane that surrounded the largest island in the ctuter of the lagoon, as if a bear or some other, heavy animal was striving to force a passage through; then the cane parted and a boat, rudely hollowed out of a single log—the “dug-out" of tl>e Southwest—containing a solitary man, who wielded a light paddle with wonderful skill, came gliding over the surface of the ink-like water. .	X
The man iu the dug-out was small of stature, with-a long, thin face7 almost as sallow as dressed buck-skln; his eye* were small, gray-green in color, and sharp- and piercing as the eyes of a wildcat, which, indeed, they resembled. "He was dressed In a homespun suit, colored with the dye of the butternut; the coat was cut like a huntlng-shirt and belted In at the waist On his feet be wore a pair of Indian moccasins; an old yellow slouched-hat was pulled down over Ms brows, and from under it escaped his long, yellow, tow-lika hair, which grew thin and scraggy.
On his lap rested a heavy double-barreled shot-gnn-r-a weapon which h^was never seen without—wik to the i&U which girded his waist were thrust two large revolvers, stiver-mounted, and a heavy bowie-knife, .with-a blade a foot long M least—a formidable instrument in the hands of a desperate man, In a close contest	r|j_ This little, insignificant, ugly fellow, who, anned as ha was, was a regular walking arsenal, was no other than Yety Ozark, the once-not&rious guerrilla cblefteta and now tns hunted outlaw.
Few men in Arkansas, or, indeed, In the whole Southwest, had given the Federal soldiers more trouble than YeU, during the late war,	. a
The outlaw combined tat bis veins the. blood of tw* Mp best families In Arkansas—the’ Yells, who had settled'V'Jfc
Ttn«i oo Crooked creek, in Marion county, and the Ozarks «f the Axkaouu bottom. At the beginning of the warha ^'runring.a small plantation on Mulberry creek, about flftCen miles from the Arkansas river, near 8alt Spring—all (hat he had left of the handsome estate left him by his father, for Tell thought more of dogs, guns and horses than he did of corn and cotton. And when he took up aims, from his .contempt of control sad thorough knowledge of the country, be organised a guerrilla band which proved to be a very m thorn in the side of the Federal army and gave no rest £> the mountain Union men of North-western Arkansas, against whom he manifested an especial hatred.
And when Kirby Smith s surrender terminated the war, test of the Mississippi, and Logan and Crockett, and a fkxen other cavalry leaders of more or less importance, came Into Little Bock and laid down their arms, Tell Ozark swore that he hadn’t quit fighting yet, and he would be dog-goned If he’d surrender to any Yank as long as he had his double-barreled shot-gun, a handful of buckshot, or a charge of powder left The others might quit the game if they liked; he’d fight the Government single-handed.
And Tell kept his word No Federal officer received Us surrender, and when the blue-coats came after him, he plunged into the pathless swamps and hid himself in the lair ef the black bear and the moccasln-snake, until the troops departed, tired of chasing a man who knew every foot of the trackless wilderness as well as the wildcat and coon.
Tell, too, always seemed well advised of the movements ef the soldiers, and it had been shrewdly whispered, by more tfcan one of the Inhabitants of Smlthvllle, that some one in ths secrets of the authorities must be on friendly terms with the hunted man.
Tell stepped from the boat to the shore. Fayette rose.
“ Danger, Ozark,” he said, briefly; “ Lieutenant Winnie is here again.”
CHAPTER III.
A TBAIL OF d£aTXL
Niqbt had come; a sable wall had gathered around the leg-c*liin of Qol Adair, better known for fifty miles up and dewu the Arkansas as “ Swapping Gol."
This cabin was rudely constructed of undressed logs, piled one on the other and so notched as to lock at the corners. The logs were “ chinked " with clay, but here and there the tfllntf had tumbled otit and left great crevices.
The house was constructed In the usual plan common to tbs South-west; two separate apartments, with a broad passageway between them, and the roof, rudely thatched, covering the whole. The chimneys, curiously constructed out of dabs of wood and clay, were placed, one at each end, on the outside of the building.
Through the chinks between the logs, on the side of the house facing the creek, from which the action of the wind and rain had loosened the clay, the light ef the huge fire, that blazed In the fireplace within, flared out on the darkness sf the night
The cabin'stood by the edge of the clearing, and about a hundred yards from the bayou.
' Gliding down on the Sluggish bosom of the Catfish, came the dug-out of Tell Ozark, and in the dug-out were Will Fayette and the outlaw.
Softly and noiselessly as a phantom bark the dug-out came on; the outlaw handling the broad paddle so deftly that tho splash of the water Was not as loud as would have been made by the wing of the kingfisher skimming along the sur face of the bayou.
<• Thar’s the d earing,” Ozark said, in a cautious tone, ss the rays of light, flashing through the chinks of the cabin trail, caught his eye.	\
“ Pot her to shore, then-,” Fayette said, using the same station in his speech. “ We must be careful and be ready to back oat, for If Adair and his dogs are home, the hounds will m out in a minute.”
; “I reckon thsr ain’t much risk o’ that," the outlaw replied, confidentlyi “but I kin aend the dug-out cavortin’ leross the drink with a single wipe of &e paddle ef the dogs are shoot, and I reckon thar ain’t many two-legged critters eould see us ten foot off, less they had eyes likes cat, like ■bis, in this hyer darkness.”
“ Give a yowl like a wildcat—a low one. If the dogs thit iriO stoit^aB.” said Fayette, a* the end oftha
dug-out grated against one of the cypress knees stretchy out under the water from tho bask.	** ,*«*
“ Me-o-wT Plaintively the. call sounded on the nlgfcl air.	*S
So skillfully had the outlaw imitated the cry of the noa turns! marauder, that a line,' fat coon, who wps descending the trunk of a large gum-tree, on the borders of the clearing, with Intent to forage on the poultry-yard of t>* planter* hunter, no sooner heard the low cry, tljan he twisted himseU tound, scampered back, ascending to the very top of the gum, evidently in great alarm.
But the yelp of some watchful dog, followed by the cherna of the rest of the pack, eager for the prey, fell not upon the ears of the two men in'the dug-out
“ As I expected, they're off, and the cabin is deserted," Fayette said, in a tone which betrayed a great deal of satisfaction. “Now then, my Idaa is just this: Lieutenant Winnie is hew for no good to us. It wss only by accident that I learned he was here at all. Old Uncle Snow saw hint, and he told the old darkey that he had come down for s week’s hunting with Gol Adsir and Dutch Pete, but I have an idea that, under pretense of hunting, he 1s going to toy and spy out the secret of our island retreat, and then bring the soldiers down on us.”
“ Why not let me lay in wait for him some day, and put a charge of buck-shof through his dog-goned headf” asked Ozark, fiercely. .
“ No, no I” cried Fayette, quickly; “ that must not be We should have the whole country about our ear*. Th» first thing is to ascertain whether he is really hew on a htmfeg expedition or not; that is what brought me down hew tonight I thought the chances were that we ahould find the cabin deserted; and if he has gone out for a hunt with Adair and Pete, we can go through his carpet-bag, and see if he has any letters of Instructions, or any memorandums relating to us.”
“ Good Idee,” remarked Ozark, laconically, as, stepping sshore, and giving the painter of the dug-out—a strip of nn-tanned hide—a turn about one of the roots of the cypress, he followed Fayette.
“ Step softly; there may be some one in the house," Fa yette said, cautiously.
“ I haln’t skulked in the brush the last seven years fes nothing,” the outlaw replied, briefly. There was Indeed little need of warning, for caution had become a second nature to the man who had been hunted like a wild beast
With stealthy tread the two approached the house, and great was their astonishment when the sounds of men’s voices fell upon their ears, coming from the room wherein the huge log-fire blazed.
After a whispered conference, the two crept cautiously up to the building, sad peered in through one of the cracks between the logs.
The fire within the room—the only light—fully revealed the inmates to the gaze of the watcher.
Two men were within the square log-chamber, reclining at full length before the fire, stretched out on bearskin robes, and smoking.
One of the men the two watchers knew well enough, ■ lieutenant of .the 41st United States Infantry—a portion of which regiment was stationed at Fort Smith above, on the river—by name Albion Winnie. He was a good-looking gentleman of about thirty years of age, wtber above the medium hight, and stoutly built; a square, full face, deer blue eyes, yellow hair, cut short; heavy, yellow mustscbs and pointed Imperial His face betrayed unfailing good-humor, and yet stern resolution. The lieutenant was attired in ablue undress uniform, which evidently had seen considerable service. It was plainly to be perceived that he was equipped for a hunting-campaign.
The second man in--the room; who was indulging in ci garettes, Mexican-fashion, was a siren jer to both Fayette and the outlaw, and they looked upoL him in wonder; ths strangeness of his costume excited their curiosity.
A single glance at the muscular figure, attired in the red blanket-coat, and we recognize the careless stranger who had so oddly announced to pretty Missouri Bmlth that he wss The-Man-from-Teus. '
With eyes and ears both intent, the United States Assessor; Fayette, and the outlaw, Tell Ozark, listened to' the convsr* sation between the army officer and the stranger.
“ Seems like*old times on ihe Plains, doesn’t itt" Winnie said, reflectively, ss he smoked1 his brier-wood pipe, and gazed upon the blazing loga
** Yes, • little," the other replied, lighting a fresh cigar-■ette, which he had deftly rolled up between his thumb and ftfcljili'l■*** - ;>n--'fir.- • xn.<
“Why, Francis, old fellow, jou trJghi have knocked me down with a feather when I met yju today on the edge of tlwclearing. If yon hadn’t stopped n>y mon'.h, I should have yelled yoor name right, out. 80, you’re to be overseer to old Smith, eh? Well, look oat for Missouri! From what yoo told me, I’d be willing to bet a month’s pay that she is in lore with yon already."
“ llow’s that?” whispered Yell to Fayette; “ reckon you’ll have to salivate this gay rooster, or he’ll jump your claim and take the gal." ■
■** Huaht” Fayette said, as Winnie continued Us speech.
” But, I say, y>u haven’t explained yet your motive for this disguise.”
“ Tliat Is easil> done,” the other replied 11 In the year 1888 my father was murdered somewhere imt this town. Before he died, he wrote the name of his murderer on a certain legal -document; quite romantic, too, the way it was done. He took a quill tooth-pick from his pocket, and his Ink was the blood which streamed from his wounds. The knowledge of this only came to me about a month ago, and as soon as I could arrange my affairs, I started for Smith-ville. Now 1 am on the ground, under an assumed name. T shall get that legal paper into my hands as soon as possible, And the name of the man who killed my father, and then—”
“ You’ll have a settlement with the gentleman?"
“ Extremely probable," The-Man-from-Texas observed, puffing a huge cloud of smoke from his mouth.
And in the air, beneath the stars, Fayette and the outlaw looked at each other, a strange expression upon their face*.
CHAPTER IV.
A POISONED BHAST.
Oh the outskirts of the “ city " of Smithvllle, by the road leading westward to Fort Smith, stood a little whitewashed shanty. It was only some ten feet square, and divided into two rooms, one over xhe other.
By the side of the house was a little garden patch, roughly feu ceil in with brush from the neighboring wood.
And by the door of the shanty, which was exactly In the center of the building, a few little wild vines, transplanted from their native woods, were trained on a rudclv-constructed trellis.
The door of the shanty was open, and the rays of the selfsame sun that had shone down upon Will Fayette entering the gloomy bounds of Black-Jack Swamp, fell now upon the figure of a woman, seated on a low stool by the doorway, intently engaged in the perusal of a letter.
The woman was girlish in appearance, although she had teen her twenty-eighth year; but she was slight in figure and foung in face, and looked more like a girl of eighteen than a woman of twenty-eight Yet her face was an earnest, sad •ne, and could not be termed beautiful, although she was not ugly. The face was more square than round; with high cheek-bones, a broad, high forehead; finn-set, resolute cliin -and-light-blue eyes, cold and clear; the complexion was in-•lin&d to sallowness, and there was not a tinge of color in the cheeks.
She was dressed very plainly, but neatly. In a dark calico, with a little white collar and daiuty white cuffs. Ilcr light yellow bair, which grew in gieat profusion, was braided and arranged in a simple coil at the back of ber head.
This girl-woman, who sat by the doorway, with the last red ray* of the sinking sun shining full upon her, reading the first love-letter which she had ever received in all her life, eAla as a marble statue, with not a pulse quickened by the Impassioned words, occupied quite a peculiar position in the littls social world of Smithville. '	.
She was called Mercie Adams, and was a school-teacher from Massachusetts. Although evidently • lady by birth and’ education,-yet, when she fltst came to reside • in Smithvllle, she had been unable to procure board at any bouse in the Tillage and had been forced to take up her quarter* on the •mskbtr 6f Um town.	'4 x
The reason Is easily told. 8h<* had been sent to the South v%.tM Jfrjkbnaai’e Boreas teach the negroes.
But, llttle by little, the resolute ** Yankee school-ma'am*
had lived-the prejudice down? She had taken possession of the little shanty and kept herself to herself, attending strictly to her duties. Instead of a firebrand/ she had turned out to be a messenger of peace and goo&wilL '	"'.'ii
Nowhere in the whole State of Arkansas was then less trouble between the blacks and • whlte»*-the freedmen and their former ma<rtara—than in Franklin county. ' This wm to be attributed no less to the1 good counsel -given by tbs school-teacher and the better informed of the negroes than to the solid good sense of the leading planters,-men like General Smith and the banker, old Fayette. They had accepted the situation in good faith, and sought to make tho Best of u.	>- .sfov.is.'
With the exception of the acts of the outlaw, Yell Ozark, no lawless deeds of violence had disturbed the peace of the county since the close of the war.
At first Mercie had been utterly unnoticed by the good people of Smithvllle; they all became suddenly blind when they saw her approaching. But, little by little, they became conscious that there was such a person as the school-teacher. First they had looked at her, next they had bowed, and some few young men of the village, bolder spirits than the rest, had ventured to remark as they passed: ** A Doe day, ma'am,'* or some otherharmless and polite expression.
And at last some of the maids and matrons of the Infant metropolis had really debated among themselves ss to th* propriety of making a formal call upon the achool-teacher.
As Mercie s^t reading the letter over and over again, as though unable to comprehend thb sweet words, a dark forsa obscured the dooiway and shut out the light of the sun.
8I1# looked up from her letter and beheld a tall, portly mac, dressed In a dark suit; he had iron-gray hair and a round, fat, florid face, smoothly shaven; his eyes were so small is comparison with the rest of his face that they seemed like two black beads rather than eyes.
This gentleman was no stranger to Mercie. He was proprietor of the largest store in the village, and the huge sign on the outside announced his name as Job Foxcroft
He had come to Smithvllle two years before from St Louis, as he stated, and had gone at once into business. Possessed, apparently, of considerable means, he had started in excellent style, and had succeeded in establishing a fine trade. From the first he had sought the custom of the negroes, and had played his game so shrewdly as to get nearly all of the country Atrade, and had made himself po popular with the blacks that when he ran for Justice of the Peace he got the negro vote solid, beating his opponent out of sight; and yet Foxcroft was well liked by the white planters, too.. He was-*" popular man with all classes. A little given to Scriptural quotations, he was-contlnually preaching peace, and there were few men in Franklin county whose words had greater weight
“ Good-evening, Miss Mercie,” Foxcroft said, blandly, as be stood in the doorway, and hlB keen little eyes glanced down searchingly at the letter which she held In her hand
So far the store-keepor bad been the only one who had sought an intimacy with her, and, with the quick instinct of woman, she had guessed that be was beginning to look upon her with more than the eyes of a friend This discovery did not -please Mercie, for she had taken a sadden and unaccountable dislike to the portly and smooth-tongued Job.
“ Good-evening, sir,” she replied, folding np her letter calmly, and rising as she spoke. She had detected In what direction his eyes were wandering.
“ May I come in, Miss Mercie?” he asked, smiling, blandly.
“ If you like, sir,” she replied, coldly, retreating from th* doorway into the room, and putting her letter Into her pocket
Without waiting for a more pressing invitation Foxcroft removed his hat and entered the little room, which was si neat as wax, although very scantily furnished
Helping himself to a chair he sat down and then surveyed the girl, with a bland smile upon his fat face.
Mercie was standing by the little open window, gazing or upon the broad surfsce of the liver, which was In full view from the house.
“ I hope that I did not disturb you in toe perusal of your letter?" he remarked •••»' wrt	i-risf-y.-'ri
*• Oh, no, sin I had already read it," Mercie replied, absently.	r •.-•aw-.j-v.J- i -.-A-r	sttT
“ From Lieutenant Winnie, I presume?" hs oon tinned, fat an insinuating way. • -J	'•••
beadle’s Dime Xibtasry*
: Tbs giri looked at him for s moment, Just a little sur-prissd.:^.....
“ How could you guess who the letter was from,?" she ssked, coldly, and evidently annoyed.
“ Why, my dear 1 child 1 the most simple thing in the world ln he replied, blandly and Innocently. 41 As I was ss-sortieg the mail last night 1 noticed the letter addressed to you, and I olao noticed that it was post-marked Fort Smith. Naturally.-knowing that Lieutenant Winnie was stationed there and that he was a friend of yours, I guessed that the letter wss from him.”
Foxcroft was postmaster of Smlthville, and the poet-offlce was located in the back part of his store.
The giri did not speak, and again turned her attention to the river. It waa plainly to l>e seen that ahe was annoyed and wished to get rid of her visitor aa soon as possible.
Foxcroft did not seem to notice this and was very slow to take the hint
“ The lieutenant got here before his letter, or rather bo-fore you received it,” Foxcroft added.
“ Is he in townf" she asked, coolly and parelessly, as if the knowledge was of very little importance to her.
*' Yes, he was this morning. Old Uncle 8now met him. He has come down to hunt with -Gol Adair. Ah, my dear child, I wish I was sure that ducks and bears were the only prey that this raging lion of a soldier has come down to our qniet village after. Scarlet in sin are these young men of th* army. They are like sailors; they have a dozen wives •11 at the same time."
Tbs lip of the girl curled Just a little as she heard this speech. It did not please her, and she understood the object or it	*
“ The lieutenant never impressed me as being any better cor worse than other young men yt his age,” she said, quietly.
“ Ton are young ln years yet,” he replied, shaking his head, gravely. “ My heart quaked within me when I found that you were in correspondence with this son of Belial I am credibly informed that the lieutenant married an Indian woman on the frontier somewhere, and I thought it was my duty to warn you. 1 trust you will excuse me.” And then, still smiling, Job rose from his seat and withdrew, leaving tbs poisoned shaft to rankle in the girl’s heart
CHAPTER V.
THE NEW OVEBSEER.
I* due time the “ Sunny South," the first boat up from Little Rock, arrived at Smithville, and on board the Sunny 8outh was General Leonidas W. Smith, the father of Missouri
General Smith was tall of stature and commanding ln appearance. He h«H a large, full face, clear brown eyes, a huge beard of- the same color, and his long, light-brown hair he wore in carefully-adjusted ringlets which came ’way down ‘over his co at-collar.
Tb# General waa not a man to be passed by without call-big fur a.second glance. ’
During-the war, General Smith had won the reputation of being'an able and experienced officer, one really second to no man of his grade ln the whole Southern army.
Rumor whispered, though, that, however successful the General had been as a military man, he was not equally successful as a planter; and it waa shrewdly guessed that the gallant General had about all he could do to make •'both cuds meet,” aa the saying is, at the close of the year.
Before the war, “ Piney-wood," so the General’s place was called, bad consisted of some two thousand acres, reputed to be as good land aa any in the Arkansas bottom; but the ravages of war had played sad havoc with the well-ordered plantation; and when the Genera] laid down his sword to take up the plow*—like another Clncinnatua—and returned again to Piney-wood, he found a house but a little better than: a ruin, and an estate, relapsing rapidly to the primitive wilderness from which the first Smith—the founder «fthe town of Smith villa—bad reclaimed it
The General knew what a dangerous experiment It was to •hangs order-of battle in front ;0f a vigilant eucmy, and bad shrewdly guessed ’.hat a creditor pressing foi the payment
of a mortgage overdue waa about as ugly ’a customer sa 'tank
well be encountered.
TUe house was almost a ruin; stock aud fences were gone the slaves were all free; and the land, now overgrown witl weeds, was all that remained of the once fine estate.
A few scratches of tlie pen and away went a thousand brood acrea to satisfy the mortgage; a few scratches mors and away went five hundred acres of the best cotton-land d the- thousand left The money received from that—the General had “ roped in " a Northerner who had got the “ cotton fever ” bad and who waa willing to pay cash down, to bny the five hundred seres—went to repairing the mansion house and fences and to restocking the place. Then Smith got a mortgage for three thousand (' jUars on tb* house and the five hundred acres remaining, which money hs vaed up for supplies for his hands, seeds, etc.
For the first year the General got on very well, bt’t the second was tough work; cotton was low, the worm got In the crop, the darkies were absorbed in politics and were not to be depended upon for regular work at the very time when every hand was needed in the field, and the large class of poor whites, who occupied their time in hanging rotvd the saloons st the landing and hunting in the swamps, stood upon their dignity as “ high-toned gentlemen,” when the General, in despair, sought their assistance to save-his crop, and asked him if. he were “ gwlne. crazy,” for to think they’d “ pick his dog-goned cotton?" Whereupon the doughs soldier cursed them, up hill and down, for a set of laz • scamps, and swore that, the moment he got a vote, he’d swa. low the whole Radical ticket to spite ’em.
That year Smith was out a thousand dollars, and, to adr to hie misfortunes, a hundred bales of cotton that he ha# held back, waiting for a rise, and shipped in the spring were burnt up going down the river when the boiler of lh< De Arc exploded, and the insurance company that bad insured the bales was " bu’stcd ” by some heavy losses just at that time, and it was rumored wouldn’t be able to pay twenty-five cents on the dollar.
So that first of April, .1868, found General Smith in a pretty tight place, financially speaking.
Piney-wood was aboat two miles back of the landing
The General had been home three hours, and was busj at Us desk, trying to devise some means to get out of his present difficulties, when “ Sam," the General’s valet, announced that a “gemman, sir,” wished to see him about the overaeer-ship.
The General had been a good deal worried with his over seers. The first one had got drunk regularly; the second one had robbed him; the third one was too fary to be of much use; while the fourth knew just as much about taking charge of a plantation as be did about navigating a bal loon.
“ Some other poor shoat, I suppose,” the General muttered, in a tone of irritation. The examination of bills due the coming first of 11 ay, which he saw no way of cilbe> meeting or staving off, had not improved the General's tcm per.
“ Di» yere gemman’s no poor shoat, massa,” 8am said, presuming as favorrtl servants will upon the good-nature of his master; “ he's a whopper, ’most big as you are, sir. He’d m«ke dem lazy nigs stand round, for sure.”	,
•' Show him up, Sam, and I’ll see what he knows."
Soon the negro conducted The-Man-from-Texas into the presence of Smith.
" Dat’s de Qeneral, sar,” and then Sam discreetly withdrew.
“ Morning, sir,” the stranger said, in his easy way. “ > heard that you was in want of sn overseer, and I’re come te apply for the situation.”
With a single glance of his keen brown ejes the old sol dier had taken ln the fine proportions of the applicant There was a look of frankness and of honesty in the bron7.e e face of the young man that took Smith's fancy. Ue hud all of Frederick the Great's admiration of stalwart, well-built
*	“ Ah, yes; I do want an overseer,” Smith said. “ What' can you dor”
There was a twinkle ln tbe eyes of the stranger and t-quiet anile about the corners of his mouth as the answer
was given:
“ Well, General, I can break and tame the wildest hors* you can bring me; I can Sing a lasso around-the hind lug; of a wild steer when he’s in full gallop; 1 can throw a brwi* with any two-legged critter from hut* to. th* Pacific:. !*■»
aa he purchased the soEen, handcuffed-dava, that he would “ letch the devil out of him,” when he got him op the Bed, and so he did. At the first blow given him, on the 4ar-o4 plantation, above the “raft” of the Red-River, tbenegr* king raised his manacled -wrists, and atrock his master dead at his feet with a single blow, then fled to the wood* and swamps.
Bis life from that time tip to the cloee of the war, no on* knew except himself.
la 1866 he had appeared in Smithville. Freed by the vu he had become quite a leader among the blacks, hot his counsel*,tended more to svil than good. The planters » garded him as a vagabond and outlaw, as he never worked, hot apparently lived by hunting, and tram what the negroes ■ gave bin oat of fear.
His enormous strength and savage disposition made ha* an Object of terror, both to the-white* and blacks.
King Congo bore an especial hatred to General Smith, as the planter had once openly said that If he caught the negro tampering with the hands on hla place, he would shoot him on sight; and it was really owing to the machinations of King Congo, that a targe portion of Smith's hands had deserted him just at the pressing time of the season the previous W-
King Congo was rudely clad in a “ hickory " shirt, open at the throat, exposing his brawny breast, and a pair of blua soldier-pantaloons. On his feet he wore a pair of Iodiaa moccasins. His head was uncovered; be utterly disdained a hat. ^He was leaning upon a long rifle, with a barrel utterly out of proportion with the rudely made stock.

•• it’s them for sure,* said Ozark; “ no one else would come this way after nightfall’’

The first of the two was William Payette; the second, tto portly storekeeper, Job Foxcroft, who was completely wind ed by his tramp through the mazes of the ,rslash,” and hla struggle with the briers and wild vines of the swamp.
Both Payette and Foxeroft were armed with shot-guns. r “ Dog-gone d long time you bin a-coming,” Ozarkaald, suljrily , “ You said an hour after sundown, and it's s blamed eight nearer three hours than one.” .
“We couldn’t very well leave the town until after tn* darkness set ln,'for fear some laquisltive ''fool might take It into' his head to foltow us,” answered Fayette. “ We took our gun: along, as it 'Jtas, s^ihat if any one should happen to run across us, going ojr returning, wo could’give as an ex-cui^for Our nocturiial tramp that wa had^bcen aftei: a'dear down to themy«k»,r*^.,‘aw4 •* ..-***• ‘

The old soldier had lUtened to the gravely-spoken speech ■af the would-be overseer with a good deal of amazemont, but the frankness of the man pleased him.
"These little gifts that you have mentioned are not a* -*ctly required of an overseer,” he said.
“ General, HI own right up,” the strangerreplied,frankly; “ Pm just as green as they make ’em In regard to running a plantation,'but I’m willing, to team, and 1‘kaow iow to obey ordara.

A Fitmms worthy of the pencil of the great Italian brigand painter, famed Salvator Boea.
The lagoon of Black-Jack Swamp by night; inky darkness resting upon the waters, and a hole burnt in the sable £loom by a pine-knot brand"heTd in the hand of the outlaw, Yell Ozark, who was standing on the bank of the lagoon, with one foot resting carelessly on the boW of the dug-out, holding it in its place by the shore.
With one band Ozark held the flaming brand on Ugh, evidently as a guide for some one whom he expected coming through the swamp; in tkb Other be grasped the barrel Of •the ihot-gun—his constant companion—the butt of which was resting on the ground.
Five paces from him, peering through the darkness into the swamp, and with bis head a little inclined to one aide, as if with intent to listen,‘Was a gigantic negro, black a* the ace of spades, and cast in the mold of Atlas, who bore th* world upon his' broad shoulders.
TW negro was known >aa King Congo, and was probably as pure a specimen of th» African race as eould be found in •U America.
Captured when a boy by the Cuban slavers, and from -Cuba brought to Louisiana, and then grown to manhood, ■fleryj and hard to manage, transferred to the Bed-River country, up «*n thd litoe of the Indian territory, the place of banishment in the old tim'" lor dangerous and intractable Slaves. In vain his masters had bestowed upon him good Cliristlas ■names, such as Sambo Wilson,: Pomj^/tfones, sod the like, but the membry of his far-off Africah home was in hit brain, and the- blood of a long line of warlike kings flowed from tola heart- If the cvuel white -tnan had not torn him from his home.lie would have been a king among his people, -and so he said proudly that bis name was King Congo The Bed River planter—a dark, stem man, reported to kar^MC* a slaver himself.in his younger days; with: a tinge . -at piracy in tlw far-off Southern Seas hinted-at—remarked.
Fpicroft litd been looking around him, and striving to n-OOVe?Ti!l bfeith. '	<■■■!? is- ':m '-.''f [ .'s'*-■;
“I haven’t had «acfc a tramp for many a long day,” ha Mid, la a tone of disgust “ Not since the time the officers were after you, eh?” Ozark sbaerved, with a chuckla
l* What the devil do you mean by that?" demanded Fox-ooft, evidently annoyed.
•'Oh,nothing; a joke, that’s all," the outlaw replied, care-tusdy, bat he winked at Fayette as he spoke.
-	“ I don’t see any use of your dragging u* Vay out here, Oaark,” the portly storekeeper said. “ My hands and face are all scratched by the brambles, and I stepped into a mud-•ole hack, up to my knees.”
•	“ Ozark, aren’t you afraid that the light Win attract the attention of some night hunter, and so lead to the discovery jf your hiding-place?” Fayette asked, referring to the pitch-pine brand that th* outlaw held.
“I raekon that tharain’t much danger; ’most sll the folks round hyer think that the swamp is haunted, and thar ain’t a nlgforten miles that would trust himself inside the outer drele after' Sundown. I reckon, too, that thar ain’t many white men that wdtdd; either, for that matter.”
“ But why couldn’t you come into town, instead of dragging us out Into this infernal mud-hole? I shall get the swam p-fever, sure," and the comfort-loving storekeeper shivered at the'very thought
*	“ I had just as lief not trust myself down to the Landing,” replied Ozark, quietly. “ I reckon that this hyer sodger ain't round Smlthville for nothing. I ain’t tired ’nough of tha game to throw my hand up yet But come, we’re losing time. Do you know whar you’re going, old maal”
CHAPTER VII.
-	. >».■ th» couzran. ut night.
Itoxcuorr looked a little astonished st the abrupt quea-lion.
“ Well, I suppose to some secret haunt of yours,” he r»
“ You’re right; to my castle; the castle of the man that’s hunted down like a wild beast; they’d put the bloodhounds arter me if they could, only the beasts won’t trail a white man. I reckon that thar ain’t a Federal officer up to Fort Smith that wouldn’t give you a heap of dollars for to guide a party of the blue-coats to this hyer spot But do you know what Fd do to the man that betrayed me? I’d give him the contents of both barrels of my shot-gun, even if I knew I’d he strung up to the nearest tree the next minltl” the ouUaw exclaimed, fiercely.
*	There is no use in your talking in that way,” Foxcroft said, evidently m at ease. “ I could not make any thing by betraying you; we’re all in together, and of coarse must stand by each other.”
“ Maybe hang so, some time,” King Congo suggested,
■	gravely.	' "v ' ‘
Tho portly storekeeper shivered again.
“ I don’t see any use of your making such cursed unpleasant remarks I” he exclaimed, luigrQy.
“ Git in, old man,” Otark said, stooping down and laying hold of the bow of the dug-out to steady It " Look out how you step, fur she’s as cranky as an egg-shell, and ef you ain’t keerful she’ll spill ye into the crick, and that wffl be wuss than the mud-hole.”
It la perhaps hardly necessary to remark that, after this caution, Foxcroft wss extremely careful how he bestowed Us portly and well-preserved person on board the frail craft The dug-out was quite a small one, only capable of holding two; so Ozark ferried Foxcroft over to the little island, that loomed up dim and misty In the starlight; left him there, and returning, carried over Fayette and the negro, one hyxmt.
The dense canebrake which surrounded the Island, grow-, tag closa to the water's edge, apparently presented a barrier capahla of keeping out all intrusion, but a passage had been eut through the canes at a certain point and a little harbor hollowed out in the shorn sufficient to receive the dug-out, Inside the lino of the canebrake.
The center of the Island was some three or four feet above Ow lard of the water, and there, under the shelter of a gigantic cypress tree, was the home of the outlaw, a small.
square hiit, just about high enough for a man to stand upright in, and rudely cohstruciedout of cypress booghs thatched with fine branches.'
In the center of the hut, Indian fashion, blazed a lor fire, the smoke of which found an exit through s note m the tool " '	*•
A few bear and wolf-ekias were' scattered about the hut, serving evidently for chairs, bed and tabl*.
The four men seated themselves on the skins ftrouad the
An.
“Now then, fur the business aforethemeeting,”Ozark remarked. “Fust and foremost, that sodger, Winnh; what is he doing down here?”
“ He’s not after Tell," Foxcroft answered at once.
“ Are you sure Of that?” Fayette asked. “ It * very suspicious. He has avoided the landing ' and taken up hi* quarters with Gol Adair. It looks to mr. as if, under pro tense of a hunting-excurslon, he had come down here to spy •ut Ozark’s hiding-place in the swamp"
“ I know that it Is not so,” Foxcroft said, decidedly. “ for I have discovered what he is after. It’s this girl. Mercia Adams, the school-teacher. A letter for her came from Fort Smith 'jresterday; and, as I guessed it was from the lieutenant—you' see, I am a little interested in that quarter myself-—I took' the liberty of bolding the envelope over a steaming tea-kettle, and so unsealed it without hurting it in the least Then I read the letter. It waa an offer of marriage, and he stated that he had a leave of absence for a month, and he would give her that time to consider the matter, and that he Should amuse himself hunting the " time. After I read the letter I sealed it up again, so of course the girl had no Suspicions that it had been tampered with.”
“ At the same time h may be that his purpose down here Is to look after us as well ss the girt,” Fayette observed, thoughtfully. “ We must think of some Way to start him off."
“Whynot go for the gal?" Ozark asked HI*ve bin wanting to dean out that durned school-marm fur a long time. What business has she got down hyer, Td like to know, teaching the nigs? HI jlst light down on her som dark night and skeer her out of her boots. Fll jlst tell ho ef she don’t git up and git, she’ll be a dead gal the fust thing she knows.”
“ That wffl do; no need to use actual violence, you know, Ozark; the threat will be enough," Fayette said.
“Yes, I reckon so," the outlaw observed, complacently.
“ I never told a man Td go fur him yit, that I didn't keep my word. When Ydl Ozark puts his mark on a man, he may aa well go and buy his coffin and pick out whar hr wants to be buried."	j.
“ And now for this stranger that has come to town,” Fa yette asked.	.. ...
“ Yon mean the young fellow with the rad blanket-coat?* Foxcroft asked, i	... y .
“ Yea; I believe that old Smith has engaged him as hi overseer.”	, ,
“Yes, to I heard, too,” Foxcroft declared.
“ Smith is pretty deep in the mire, now; he mustn't have a chance to get out,” Fayette remarked, thought fully.
“ Well, this new-comer wont be apt to help him much. Judging by his looks," observed Foxcroft “He’s more like a cattle-driver than an overseer.”
“The only thing is, if he can keep his hands to work, and they get a good crop in all right, Smith may be able to get an advance on it Our mortgage la due the first of May, and' there’s considerable back-interest, too,” Fayette suggested. *• Yon see, my game is this; I want old Smith's daughter Missouri, but the young lady hasn’t seen proper to take a fancy to me, but if I can get tbe father on my side, and appear to Missouri as a man who is willing to sacrifice himself to save her father from ruin, she is just romantic enough to be captivated by the Idea. - But, I don’t like this overseer, and I have heard that the giri baa taken a fancy
Foxcroft opened bis eyes in aatonishmeat,
“Why, has Mha Smith met the fellow before?”
“Yes; I don’t understand whet* or wbws, but they han me1 How, I think a la really necessary to run this over-•ear oat of Smithville.”
“ Where does hs come from, anywayr Foxcraft de-■sanded.
“Ha's from som* town la the bat; tnm To* Kate. I
IMa*. Left me see; -what Vm the name of that town?" Fa-
j&tte asked, thoughtfully, apparently looking Into the 'fire, but to reality keeping a close watch on Foxcroft’s face, *MDh1 PennYan. He's after some fellow who levanted from Penn Tan.”
Foxcroft’s face turned ashy pale, and great drops of sweat tame oat on his forehead.
1 How cursed close it is here,” he mattered, taking oat his handkerchief and mopping his fart with it Fayette and1 Ozark exchanged' glances, while King Congo looked on, evidently unable to comprehend the scene.
“ Oh, decidedly, he mustbe got out of the way I" Foxcroft •xcl aimed, abruptly, a tremulous tone to his voices “ tie might take the girl away from you, Fayette. We mast ran him out some way; Til do all I can to help!"
“ Pve no doubt of it,” Fayette said, dryly, while the outlaw had to torn his head to conceal the grin upon his face.
B'rt how can we do It?” queried Foxcroft, anxiously, ■ever noticing Fayette’s peculiar reply.
“ King Congo here must try his hand at the stranger," said Fayette. “ You must stir up the hands to quit work, and if the overseer Interferes, as of course hit will, you must give hin a sound mauling; that is, if you can."
The negro stretched out his brawny arms, and the dim light of the fire shining on them, they glistened like arms of bronze, t v>	>
“ Me smash ’uml" he said, laconically.
But the stalwart negro had not seen The-Man-fram.Texaa,
*St ,r -1
" Well try that first; then, if you don’t succeed in driving him-off, we’ll have him arrested for assault, and haul him up before you, Foxcroft, and you can fine him so heavily that he’ll be obliged to get out I guess we can stretch the law a UttlsL-
“ And who has «oba your friend?" questionedlkyettei never once losing his temper; “ who gave you timely waning when the soldiers were after you, so that ynu could either get into the swamps or run sat of the county? Who has saved you from the' traps that have been laid for you, ten times at least?”
. “ Well, 1 s’pose yoo have,” Yell answered, doggedly.
“ What do you talk like an idiot for, then? The benefit derived from the killing of Tom Warren has not been all oa one side, and you know it weU enough.1*
“ Now, it’s no use to have any words about the matter,” Foxcroft interposed, in his smooth, oily way. “We'll aB help each other, of course, and there’s no use discussing who gets this most benefit from oar little partnership. The >nly thing is to stick to each other and try and work for our mu. tual advantage."
“ I’m geUlng tired of skulking in the swamps,” Ozark rejoined; “I’d like to have a plantation of my own ag’in. I have got my eye on a gal that I think wfll suit me, and If I can git her, I’ll d’ar out the fust thing you know, and hop over the line into the Injun country. Thai’s mighty good cotton land down on the Bed, nigh the LuzUnny line.”
“ What girl is It?" Fayette asked.
“ Tilda Forsyth, my wife’s sister. She Uvea on the Ozark place, down the river, belowCatfish Bayou.”
“By the way, what ever became of your wife, Yell?” Fayette asked, carelessly.
“ She died ofa fever," Ozark replied, Us faoe growing dark as he spoke. “ My place up on the Mulberry w'ss terribly low and onhealthy. Some folks said that I killed her, ’cos I Ut her a slap in the faoe when I was drunk, one night, but they lie, dog-gone ’em! Pm a gentleman, I am, and of good family, too, though I am rough and ready. I didn’t slap her hard enough to kill a ’skeeter, and she deserved % too; she jawed me and said that I was nothing but a poor, mean, drunken shoal, and HI Tow that I ain’t agoing to stand any woman’s ’base!”
There was just a little curl to Fayette’s lip as he listened to the outlaw’s explanation, but Yell did not notice it “ Well, what does Tilda say about it?" Fayette asked. “ Have you told her any thing about the matter?"
“ I kinder Unted ’bout it the last time I was down thar," Yell replied. “ I told her that I felt lonely skulking round In the swamps like a dog-goned pole-cat, and said that ef I could find a woman to tie to, I’d puU up stakes and hop across the. Arkansas line right lively.”
“ Did she seem to understand what you wen driving atf* Fayette persisted.
“ I reckon she did.”	--
“ Did she seem to cotton to the idea?"
“ Nary time," replied the outlaw, laconically; “ she kinder got her back up like a wildcat, and said that I had better go and marry a she-bear—a wife that could gTn me slap for slap and maybe Uf a duroed sight harder than I could. I see’d at once then that she’d beerd that lie ’bout my killing her sister."
“ Did you attempt to get her out of that Idea?”
“Dura my cats!” cried Yell, in astonishment; “de jOu ’pose I’d waste my time trying to talk with a womar when she’s got her back upl Not a bit of it! Wh.m^V wif# used to gi’n me any talk back, I never tried to with her.

■	“ Oh, yes, I gueee we can, if the affair is worked the right way. You most be careful, Congo, to get Urn to strike you lint, and if you can have two or three of your friends handy to swear good and strong that he provoked the fuse, why< I can very easily sweat him with a heavy fine, and tiwm, afterward, I can give him a chance to break and run for h”.
“ Me’d rather smash ’uml” the negro growled, discontentedly.
“ Well* you can try that first,” Fkyette said.

If jfou had come to and surrendered at the close of the war, with the net, why, it would have been all right; but since that time you hare committed some acta that look a good deal like murder,” Fayette said.
“ Allen did it in fair fight,” Ozark rejoined, still sullenly.
“ Not exactly; YelL You can’t call the shooting of Tom Warren, the assessor, a fair fight Why, man, you called him to his door to the night and put two loads of buckshot into Mm, before he could lift a finger."
. “Didn’t he hunt me through the brush with twenty or thirty. Soldiers, the week before, jist as if I had bin a b’ar or

“I believe that I gave you the advice,” Fayette replied, eooQy, and not to the least intimidated by the threatening Manner of the outlaw. . .
“ It wasn’t your political friends down to the Rock that made you assessor of this district; it was Yell Ozark and his shot-gunr cried the outlaw, angrily. “ I didn’t see what yes,was after, tJun, but 1 do now.

“By Jovel old Sue has outdone here If today," he muttered, and Missouri, demure as a kitten, doing the honors of the table, never.smiled or seemed const ions of her father’s satisfaction. But she watched the fact of The-Man-frqm-Texas intently when she thought that fas was not observing her, and she detected there an expression of sadness every now and then, which she could not accounted. .
When the new overseer retired to his room, (bat night, hardly had he entered It when the fragrant flowtrs attracted his attention. •	; «	,
Ho guessed at once from whom the thoughtful act had proceeded, and taking up one of the little flowers he pressed It to his lips and kissed it again and again. Then, with a sudden motion as though eome thought had. flashed across his brain, he cast the flower back into the tumbler. . .
"No, no, 1. must not think of this girl!” he muttered. “ First for toy task of vengeanoel That fulfilled and life spared to me, I may think' of loirs—of an earthly paradis* such as the .embrace of -this young, beautiful and innocent girl can give me, If she will. I must get the paper to my hands as soon as possible that will give me the name of my father’s murderer; then comee the chase after the man himself, for he may be a thousand milee from here; perhaps^ even, he may have closed hlsr account with earth and.gone to another world."	i:>. < r

'When the seed came, Texas rose to Bet his men to work, bul discovered that a strange negro, of burly build, accompanied by two or three other strange blocks, was in busy jbwiv^mtlon with the hands.
"^l^'roril the description the General had given him, he recog-nlz^d" King Congo,' in the burly black, and a presentiment that there was trouble ahead came at once to him.
’ The overseer took i good look at the. negro, measuring him with his eyes like a pugillst-hia opponent In the “ ring;” 1 (hen he advanced quietly to the group. .
•>»r,
CI1 APTER , X. straight from toe shoulder.
Smith, during the walk over the plantation on the previous day, had happened incidentally to mention the name of King Congo; and Texas, struck by the singularity of the appellation, had inquired concerning the black, so that he was well posited in regard to the burly negro.
As Texas drew near to the group, he found that Congo was engaged in denouncing General Smith, and urging the hands not to work for lilm.
Texas saw at once that the negro relied more upon bis personal appearance and threatening manner than upon the etoquenoe of his words, for Congo was not a ready speaker, end was but little versed in the art of oratory.
As the overseer came close to the group, .he overheard the closing port of the negro’s speech.
“ What for you work for dis cussed white man?” the burly black exclaimed, doubling up his huge fist and shaking It threateningly at General Smith, who, busy overseeing the bands, in a neighboring field, some distance o3, had no suspicion of the trouble that was brewing. “ Dar’s catfish in te bayou an’ corn in de swamp! Don’t strike a lick in de •eld! Starve ’tun; den dey go away, an’ de Ian’s all yours. HI ki>l some of you workin’ niggers ’fore long, you see If 1 don't. You’re only fit for de white man to walk oberl” And then King Congo glared ferociously around him, and shook his huge blffcK fist in the air.
“See here, you infernal black hippopotamus, just you make tracks and get off this plantation!” Texas said, coolly, and without a trace of exdtcment In his manner, stepping forward and confronting the gigantic negro.
The black field-hands drew back a few steps In wonder; they -had been clustered around Congo in a little half-circle.
The overseer had advanced within a yard or so of the black, and had taken a position that would have delighted eitlier a fencing-master or a teacher of the “■ manly art of aelf-UefeiuHi;” although contrary to the general rule of the latter, be rested the weight of his body on his right foot, and the left was advanced; his right arm was carried carelessly down at his side, but the left was raised to the level of his waist, and "half drawn back, the forearm resting on bis hip. Light, springy and graceful, he balanced his body on the forepart of his feet, just as if he were waiting for the jnusic .to strike, upto glide at once into the “ one—two " of the exhilarating polka.
: King C6ngo, with a sullen scowl upon his dark face, surveyed the overseer for a moment in silence.
To tell the truth the burly negro was rather surprised at the appearance of The-Man-from-Texas.
. Tho overseer bad removed the blanket-coat, owing to the warmth of the sun, and also taken off his collar and necktie, and loosened the ahirt at the neck, and the black could clearly perceive how muscular was the chest and arms which the dainty ruffled shirt covered.
Texas was no mean antagonist even for the gigantic negro, tlhough some six inches shorter in bight, and at least fifty pounds lighter in weight. But the fifty pounds of flesh extra was rather a disadvantage to Congo than otherwise, for fat will tell on ft man’s wind when heavy blows are to be given and parried in quick succession.
The negro was heavy and fat, clumsy in movement, and evidently entirely destitute of aU knowledge of the boxer’s •rt, while Texas, for so large a man In build, was singularly light on bis feet, and grace*al in his movement; and a riiigle «laaae at hie attitude wouli) have betrayed toone skilled In the
use of the “gloves" that he waa ln“ position "either toghn
Or parry a blow.	<- -At
In the parlance of the fisdc art, a left-footed masi Is e* aemely difficult to “ g«* at” w j	.
The negro, who bad* never before faced an. opponent -whe knew any more about the scientific use of thr weapons that nature had given him than himself, did not perceive that the overseer was within “ reach,” Abd prepared to administer a terrific “ left-hander,"
“ Who you speak to, white man?" exclaimed King Congo, •cowling darkly upon the'daring overeefer.
“ You, you black scoundrel!” replied Texas, sternly, and there was just a slight tremor In the muscles of the left arm, a sort of quiver of Impatience.
“ Go ’way, or m walk ober you—cussed fool!” cried the black, drawing back his right srm, threateningly.
Standing as he did with his heels close together, In about the most clumsy attitude possible, a skillful boxer could not have wished for a better opportunity.
Quick as a wink, the left arm that was resting so carelessly upon the birfBLttHd overseer, wsa drawn back, then shot out, and the ike fist, landing on the fleshy face of the negro, floored him as if he had been shot
A cry of astonishment came from the surrounding blacks; they had witnessed many a rough scuffle, but they had never seen a maD knocked down In so neat and skillful a. manner before.
That The-Man-from-Texas was excited wss evident; the blood was up in his facc; his eyes were snapping, and his muscular arms, now both raised oa guard, were working nervously like the piston of a steam engine.
Congo struck the ground with a howl like a wild beast In all his life he had never received such a blow before. Already his head seemed swollen to twice its usual size.. In all ws previous battles Congo had either battered down his adversary with one or two’ powerful blows, or else had got him in his powerful arms, and crushed him half to death with an anaconda-like grip.
When -the black regained his feet, half-crazy with rage, he found that he could not see out of his left ere. The ovei seer's iron-like knuckles had cut a terrible gash In the fleshy cheek underneath, and closed the eye up.
Right and left—thrashing tho air like the sails of a windmill—a dozen tremendous blows the negro delivered at his foe, driving the overseer before him. Texas skillfully retreat erf, light on bis feet as a dancing-master, hardly taking the trouble to attempt to parry the wildly directed strotesj half of which were out of distance.
The negro had wasted his tremendous strength upon the empty air, and puffing and blowing, completely winded by the violent exertion, he stopped and wearily dropped his bands to the level of his waist for a moment' Then the overseer, fresh as a daisy and light as a feather, crept within “ reach ” and 11 feinted ” with his right band, at the negro's body. Clumsily Congo outstretched both hands to ward off the ' blow, when again, quick as a flash, the terrible lefthander landed on the fleshy face, and again King Congo went over on his back, flat on the ground.
A howl of delight went up from the negroes; all the brute part of their nature* aroused, they weie really enjoying the contest
Calm and cool as an iceberg, although slightly flushed with his exertions, the overseer wailed for the negro to rise.
King Congo got upon his feet very slowly. The tremendous efforts he had made In the last “ round ” were beginning to tell upon him, to say .nothing of the effects of the two terrible blows that he bod received.
The burly black was now almost blind, for the second stroke of the overseer had cut the right cheek under the eye, as If It had been gashed by a knife, and, as the swelling was Increasing visibly almost every instant, it wss very ccrtain that soon the right eye would be closed as well as the left
It was plain that Ae gigantic block must conquer the powerful and skillful white man within ten minutes or else Congo’s star would set Id darkness.
The howl that the negroes had given at the second smock* down blow bad attracted the attention of tbs General, and perceiving the little crowd by the fringo of timber, he Instantly concluded that something was wrong and came te haste to see what was the matter.
Great was his astonishment when he arrived upon th# scene. It only1 needod a single glance for him to understand the whole affair.
fbe overseer, smiling and confident; the bariy black.
sternly, addressing the strange negroes, -whom be recognise* at once as being Congo’s companions. “ And, seehSre, my fine fellows, I don't want to see any of you skulking round my place any more; I don’t mean you, Unde Snow, but those other two. You’ve .seen how your leader has been handled, so you Just look out for yourselves.”
Two of the negroes who were with Congo did not beat the best of namesr-having the reputation of depending mors upon the stray chickens and pigs of the planters for subsistence than upon their own toil, but the third on* war old Uncle Snow, a very worthy old man.
Casting a single glance at the black Hercules, who was being slowly assisted to bis feet by his companions, and perceiving that he had no appetite for any more instruction In the fisticuff line, Texas called to his hands:
“ Come, boys, let’s get at that field; we’ve lost considerable time.”	,
bleeding, panting, and his faoe, always hideous, now render* addaubly so by the two terrible gashes that the knuckles of . The-Man-from-Teias had made. The General felt aU the old soldier blood la his veins swell at the eight.
: “Don’t mind me, boyBl” he yelled; “goon with your fU. . Two to one on the overseer. Time!”
The General was wildly excited.
CHAPTER XI.
'■AULT ADD BiTTIftT.
But the brawny bully was slow to respond to the call He stood looking at the overseer, who had handled him so roughly, with an expression of wonder upon his brutal face, sow swollen almost beyond the possibility of recognition.
Never in all his life had he encountered such a foe, and, with the superstition comoon to his race, he began to believe that he wss bewitched.
“ Come, hurry up,” Texas cried, impatiently; " come on, anless you’ve got all you want”
“ He kill your’ cried the black, all his anger reviving at hearing the voice of his foe.
Again the gigantic negro rushed upon his enemy, striking wildly, blow after blow, at the overseer, using all the strength of his mighty form, and again the dextrous white nimbly Jumped from side to side, and retreating, gave way before the rush of the giant
As before, the black was compelled to pause at last, strength and breath both exhausted by his powerful efforts, and then, ss he had previously done, tho overseer carefully “ weaved ” himself with distance and planted two awful blows in quick succession upon the disfigured face of the negro, but, as Congo had braced himself to receive the attack, be was not hurled to the earth as before.
Two more dreadful cuts now appeared on the negro’s face, when, maddened with rage and pain, Congo dashed recklessly upon Texas.
The overseer had jumped back out of distance after striking the last powerfui blows and was fully prepared for the trash assault
Panting for want of breath, smarting under the pain of the bleeding bruises, and almost blind from the effccts of the frightful punishment he had received, Congo was as an Infant aow in the hands of the overseer.
The strokes and thrusts of the negro lacked power, and feeing given u round-armed,” instead of straight from the shoulder, the white brushed the burly fists aside with his artistic guard as if they bad been feathers Instead of fists of bone and muscle. And then, ss the giant stopped for a moment, exhausted, Tbe-Man-from-Texas “ drew himself together ” and, firmly braced on his sinewy legs—steel and willow combined—dealt the negro a most terrific blow, which landed full in the center of the chest with a “ thud ”
-	that sounded like the crack of a black-snake whip. The blow, delivered with all the force of the overseer’s arm and body combined, lifted the negro fairly from the ground and hurled him, with a tremendous shock, senseless to the earth
After he struck the ground, Congo’s head went back with a bump which plainly told that all the fight had been knocked out of him. ‘	-*•••'. -
“Hooray!” yelled the General, in delight, unable to ex. frees his feelings.
For a. moment both the acton and the spectators ln the affair stood still, a perfect tableau, just if as they expected to be immortalized by some wandering artist taking the scene sa the spot by the aid of the magic camera.
The black lay motionless on the ground, evidently stunned, his body limp and the muscles relaxed; the overseer had his hands half up, as though expecting the vanquished gladiator to spring up and renew the fight; while the negroes and the General looked on with wondering eyes.
Then a change came over the scene. Texar dropped his jaada, took out his handkerchief, which he had stowed away in the pistol-pocket of his pantaloons, and commenced to wipe the Mood from bis knuckles, which had been stainal by contact with the negro’s face.
“By the Lord, Mr. Texas, I believe you’ve killed the scoundrel!” the General exclaimed, advancing to look at the
m a le spoke, the black begaa to revive.
Yes had bettrr help him, tame of you.” Smith said.
And, without a word regarding the late straggle, the over-
eeer, followed by the blacks, went at once to work.
The General looked after his new hand in amazement
“ That man’s a trumpi” he exclaimed, emphatically. “ By Jove! he’s a man, he is! Why didn’t Heaven give me such a son ss that?”
Then the General took a look at the conquered black.
Both of Congo’s eyes wore cloeed, and his face waa swollen terribly. But, now that he had recovered from the stunning effects of the bloTf, he wss strong enough on his legs.
Congo was almost frantic with rage, but he had sense enough to know that he was thoroughly beaten and that he was no match for the white man. He had got enough, and was fully sensible of the fact, half-animal though he waa.
“ You’s almost blind!” one of the negroes remarked, looking into Congo’s face.
“ Wipe de blood off!” muttered the “ king,” sullenly.
“ You had better take him down to the doctor and have some leeches applied to his eyes,” Smith said, “ and let this be a lesson to you, Congo, not to come tampering with my hands again.” And with this remark the General turned away and went back to his work. He fully understood that no good purpose had brought the black to his plants tton
The negroes led Congo siowiy away; the conquered man' satisfying his mind with fearful threats of vengeance against the overseer, old 8mith and all the white people in general.
At noon time work was stopped and the General and the overseer met at the house for dinner.
Then, in answer to the General’s inquiries, Texss related how the affair had commenced:
Smith was loud in his expression of satisfaction.
“ By Jove, sir, you know how to handle your fists as well as a regular pugilist!” the General exclaimed. “ You gave him the most scientific thrashing that I ever saw administered, and when I was a young man I saw a good deal of that sort of thing at the North.”
“ I had a boxing-master for about three years,” the overseer answered, carelessly; “ circumstances were so that it didn’t dbst me any thing, and I rather liked the exercise— not thatHtimagined I should ever put the knowlodge to any practical use.”
“ And he’s a much heavier man than you, too.”
“ That didn’t amount to any thing; rather in my faw than otherwise; his extra weight was fat When I took a look at his overgrown face, I knew I could shut his eyes up with one or two good cracks. If I had let him close in on me, he might have worried me; but as long as I kept him at arm’s length, til I had to do was to tap him where I pleased. I saw from the first that all he knew was brute strength.”
Then they went in to dinner, and, as on the previous day, the General was aatonialied ut tuu improvement in the cook’s skill.
The subject of the battle royal wss not mentioned, but Texas’ shrewd eyes noticed that Missouri looked earnestly at his hands, the knuckles of which were a little discolored, ss he sat down to the Uble, and be guessed that she had heard of the affair.
Dinner over, the General and the overseer Ut their cigars, preparatory to resuming work, and just as they stepped from the veranda to the ground, a horseman rode up. It was Lea Johnson, the sheriff.
“How do, Generalf” he said. “•'Pw got a warrant hyer for the arrest of your overseer. ’Seult an* battery. |< s'pose this gentleman’s mr manf

*7	:r 'I'-'.’ .. •• "
Thu General stared at the sheriff In astonishment " What’s thatr he cried. In amazement.
“ I say, Ptb got a warrant hyer for the arrest of your ovwr seer; ’sault and battery,’’ repeated the officer.
“ Why, you haven’t had any trouble with an; one, hare you?” Smith aaxed, in wonder, turning to Texna.
•	“ Not that I’m aware of,” tho overseer replied “ There must be some mistake.”
“ I reckon you’re the man, stranger," the sheriff replied; 44 you answer to the description.”
“ Who makes the complaint; do you know, Lea?” tbs General asked.
“Yes; it’s that big nigger. King Conga"
A low whistle of astonishment came from the General’s Ups.
"■ “ Well, now, this beata me I" he exclaimed. “ Why, Lem, you know what a scamp that Congo 1st He came on my place here this morning, tried to persuade my hands to quit work, and when my overseer here—Mr. Texas, Mr. Johnson —interfered, the nig talked back to him, chock full of fight, too. Well, he Just got whaled; Johnson, you wonld have given ten dollars to have seen how beautiful Mr. Texaa here walloped that cuss. I’m an old man, Johnson, and have traveled a good deal, but It was the prettiest fight that I ever saw in my life. The way we cleaned out Banks, down on ae Red River, wasn't any thing to it.”
Siiiith was quite excited.
" Of course, General, I don’t know any thing about It," Toknson explained. "Justice of the Peace, Foxcroft, put the warrant Into my hands, and of course I’ve got to serve tt I told the Justice that I thought it was a leetle out of my line, but you see the constable, Bill Smith, is down flat on his Lack with the shakes—by the way, General, Bill's some sort of a relation of yours, isn’t he?”
“ Yes, third cousin Bill is sick, eh?”
“ Awfult I toid him when he bought that place down on the C(.tflsh that it were powerful unhealthy," the sheriff said. “ Well, as I said atore, Bill’s sick, and his deputy, Jim Forsyth’s gone up to Foit Smith. He went up on the Des Arc yesterday—mighty fine boat that Des Arc, General, a heap sight better than the oid one; well, you see, thar wa’n’t any official left In the town to serve the dumed thing, 'less I toted it; so I Jest thought that I would oblige the Justice for onc't"
“ Yes, of course I uhdetstand,” Smith said; “ I s’pose you will have to go in, Mr. Texas, since the warrant is out. But that beats me, Lem I The idea, of coming and picking a fuss, and then going and gating ou^ a warrant for an assault."
“ That’s kinder raking things,” Johnson remarked, soberly. 41 From the looks of the dark, I should have judged that he had had about sixteen onto him.’’
“ Whipped him in fair fight! 1 saw nearly all of it myself. Johnson, you wo)ild have givon twenty-five dollars to have seen the fight!” the old Arkaualan exclaimed, excitedly.
From the looks of the nig, I reckon I would, General,” ike sheriff said, with an air of sad reflection.
“ Sam, saddle my Morgan, and the black, right away!” the Genial shouted to the negro, who was sunning himself out-side^he stable.
“ ’Deed, sar, dat black done gone lame," replied 8am.
“ You’ll have to ride the spotted mustang, then; 1 must tall Missouri,” and the General re-enterwl the house.
The overseer’s horse had been sent to the blacksmith to b« re-shod, Just before dinner, and hadn’t returned.
Hardly had the General closed the door behind him when he was Joined by Missouri. Concealed behind the Venetian blinds of the dining room, she evidently had overheard all that Utid passed.
Smith was proceeding to explain, but his daughter interrupted him with tho assurance that she knew all about it “ Tou can have the mustang, of course, father,” she said, hurriedly; “ but what will they do with Mr. Texaa? I’m sure the negro deserved all he got, although Mr. Texas did strike him first; but I know that that big brute said something dreadfully Insulting to him.”
“ Why, how did you know that he atruck him first?" the Oeneral asked, ln amazement. “ Oh, I suppose that some of the hands toid you about it."
“ No, father; where should I see any of the hands?” the ani replied, evidently confused.
“ How the mischief, then, did you know any thing about It?" Smith questioned, in a puzzle.
“ Why, I happened to be up stairs in the enpoU, and saw it all from beginning to end/* she replied, slowly, aatf Ja great embarrassment	•
But the General was decidedly more astonished at thlsstato-ment than he had been at first.	I..*
“ But ho^&could you see the affiib from the cupola?" be asked; ‘4 the field is over half a mile olL”
” Why, I—I had your field-glass, father," she answered blushing red as fire as she spoke.
“Oh, I see," the old man said; and, busy as hii mind waa, thinking of the outrage of the overseer's arrest, ha took but little notice of his child’s confusion. And she, oa her pert, wss heartily glad that he did not press Ids question further, and ask her what she waa doing up In the eupola with the field-glass for a companion.
" We can have the mustang, then?" the General said, r» treating to the door.
“ Yes, certainlyi" waa the decided reply; “ but, father, they can’t trouble Mr. Texaa, can they?"
“ Of course net, In Justice! The fellow provoked the thrashing, anyway, and deserved all he got I suppose the idea Is to make It appear an outrage on the negroes, and so make a sort of political affair out of It; but I don’t think they will be able to do It In this county. The war Is over and we understand It, and there is no more law-abiding oom munity anywhere In the United States."	1
" But, father. If there is any trouble, you’ll stand by him —you’ll see him through, won’t you?" asked the girl, persuasively.
“ Will I?” exclaimed the old General, hastily; “ by the Lord I will! I’U see him through if it takes every mule oa the plantation!”
Then Smith emerged from the house to the veranda.
Sam had the General's brown Morgan mare saddled, and stood waiting with It In front of the house.
“ Saddle the spotted mustang, Sam, for Ur. Texas," the planter ordered, as he mounted Into the saddle, quite lightly for one of his yoars'and build.
“ Yes, sar; I done saddle de mustang. I ’spects you’d want dot!” Sam answered with a grin; and then, in obedience to his whistle, a colored boy led out the spotted mustang—Missouri's pet—from the stable, saddled and bridled The overseer leaped lightly Into the saddle, and the party set out
From behind the Venetian blinds, pretty Missouri watched the horsemen until they disappeared around the bend of the road	—
The horsemen, riding briskly toward the landing, soon got Into conversation.
“Times are changing mightily, ain’t they, General?” the sheriff observed “ I kin remember the time when two gentlemen could have a nice quiet fight, and a sheriff that went to arrest one on ’em, would have bin mobbed ease. Why, they could even use their shootln’ irons, and the authorities wouldn’t interfere.”
“ That’s so,” asseverated the General. 44 When wffl the examination take place?”
“ Jlst as soon as we git thar. The nig and his lawyer air waiting. Bob Howard’s his lawyer. Bob’s a good lawyer; better Jedge of whisky, though."
“ If they've got Bob Howard, they mean business,” the General exclaimed, earnestly. “I reckon we better pick up Judge Yell, as we go by his place. The Judge knows the law."
“ HI low he does, but he’s the durnest old cuss for a
practical joke in the bull State. I reckon ef the Jedge ana Bob come together, law and whisky will suffer,” the sheriff remarked, sagely.
Gol Adair was » Uttle wiry, dried-up sort of scan, with 4 aids as yellow as parchment sad almost as tightly drawn over . the bonea aa that of a mummy. His.harsh yellow hair waa chopped oil close to hit head—hi* own hand and a Sharp, edged bowie-knife always attending to the trimming operation) his eyes were little, deep set in his head, and a green-ish gray in color—more like the eyes of an animal than a man. He was dressed in a homespun suit that once had been but-tcraut-brown in color, but exposure to wind and rain, contact with the black* mud of the bayou, the yellow sands of the Arkansas and the red day of the river-banks, to say nothing of the numerous patches of various colors, with which the thrifty Gol had at timea repaired the rents and tears that tframbly branches and the claws and teeth of wild beasts had made in hk garments, had now so utterly changed the orlgi nal color that it was hard to say which was the prevailing tint
Go! was plainly armed—a long, ugly-looklng rifle and a ■ingle twelve-inch bowie-knife being his only weapons.
Adair wss quite a character. He had emigrated from upper Georgia, some thirty yean before, and taken up his real-ifartrA in AtkftnRftH
At that time peltry'was plenty on the upper Arkansas and its branches, and Adair followed the occupation of a trapper for a living; but, as time passed on, the price of fun declined and the animals themselves became scarce, so Adair gave up trapping and looked around for a plantation.
And just about that time, old Colonel 8m 1th founded the town of Smithvllle, and as the Catfish Bayou had been one Of Qol’s favorite haunts in the early days when he had first favored Arkansas with his presence, he selected about twenty acne, just above the junction of the bayou with the Arkansas, and erecting a log-cabin, assisted by the inhabitants of lb* city—that was to be—settled down upon his “ estate.”
Adair never amounted to much in the planter line, though that could not be expected of the owner of twenty acres, surrounded as he was by estates, the smallest of which was over a thousand acres in extent.
But Adair declared he wouldn’t have the best plantation in the county. He wasn’t a-going to be a slave to any “ duraed cotton crop, or any other kind of a crop—not ef he knowed hlsselfl”
All he wanted was five or ten bales—enough to buy groceries and liquor. Com he could raise himself; there waa plenty of fish in the bayou, and his rifle could bring him all the meat he wanted and pay for his powder, caps and balls, besides.
And as for the two or three half-wild horses that he always possessed, in the winter he turned them into the cane-brake where they fed on thfeyoung cane until they were aa fat as hogs, and in the summer, the rank grass of the prairie gave them food
Adair was noted, too, for his swapping propensities. H« was never so happy as when In a trade. He had been known to start out of Smithville, riding the worst-looking “clay-Dank ” horse that ever a man bestrode, with a little mean open-faced rilver watch in his pocket and a rusty shot-gun on his shoulder, stride over the line into the Indian nation, and come back, ia a month, with a couple of fine horses worth seventy-five or eighty dollars apiece—high prices those, for even extra hones, on the upper Arkansas, before the war— aa excellent double-barreled gUn—or a fine rifle, maybe— two or three pistols or knives, and a good solid hunting-csse Watch In hi* pocket; all of which trophies were the product* Of a aeries of judicious swaps.
' Smithville folks said Gol Adair would rather swap than eat, and as they were his near neighbors, they naturally were pretty well posted on the subject.
Adair was peculiar in another way, too. He never owned a slave, and when questioned on the subject by some zealous neighbor who had got a notion into his head that Gol belonged to that dreaded class known aa “ Abolitionists,” the withered-up hunter s-nply said that they were too much trouble, and he wasn’t “ gwine to be a slave to any nig,” himself. 11 They eat more’n they raised, an’ would steal tnore’n they’d eat" This was Gol’s idea on the subject. Then, too, he never troubled his head about politics. And ooe time, when party spirit ran high, and the anxious men on either ride were (bumming up aU the recruits they could |et, Gol Adair waa finally badgered into a promise that he routd come to Smithville and vote, for once in his life, tad, true to his word, he walked up to the polls and voted for Gineral George Washington for President; and when re-
sanaStrated with by the leading men of both parties, who
reminded him that the “Father of Us Country w wardwH; Gol replied, coolly, .that lt didn’t “make any difference~r Oineral Washington dead would make a great deal bettes President than any live man that they could scare up, from, Maine to Mexico, nowadays.”
After that, Gol Adair was let alone, as far as politic* were concerned.	. ... _.
When the war broke out, Adair .saw at once, with Ida shrewd good sense, that It would be deariy impossible for him to keep oat of it and remain at home. So, one fine morr’ ig before the sun waa up, Gol Adair whistled his doga around him, mounted hi* best hone, and "lit” out.
A party of the young hot-blooda of the village—a slip of the pen, we mean “ dty ”—who visited Adair’s cabin that very day, with intent to make him enlist or fight, found the floors ot the cabin wide open, all the skins—Gol’s simple substitute for furniture—gone, and a rude sign stuck in a crevice of the timber, which bore the brief but express!™ inscription:
v. “Gone tin the war quits.”
Smithville saw no more of Gol Adair untfl the «ni™i« of 1866; then he saddonly appeared, as usual, riding a better horse than he had gone away on, and dropped right back again into his old place, just as naturally as if he had neves left it
He had spent the four yean of the war down in Texaa far away from ail knowledge of the hostile acenes, and it was only by accident that he had heard of the termination of the struggle.
Five or six feet from Gol—who was crouched down on the grass, playing with his pet squirrel, one at the black Mexican breed that he had brought with him from Texas— sitting on a log, was the German, Peter Ritter—or, as more generally termed, Dutch Pete. He was a flaxen-haired, blue-eyed youth, apparently not over eighteen, but well and stoutly built, after the universal fashion of his healthy coun-
Tramping through the country, he had sought shelter, on* night, at Adair's cabin, and the two, getting into convene, tion after supper, smoking their pipes together before the huge log fire, took quite an interest in each other.
The old hunter, Gol Adair, who for yean had avoided th* society of his fellow-men, took a strange fancy to the simple German lad who was without either parents or friends.
Adair noticed the repeating rifle, Coifs patent, that the youth carried, and shrewdly suspected from that that the boy had been a soldier in the Union army, although of course it was natural that he should wish to keep that fact to him self, for at that time a good deal of the bitterness of the wax still remained in that section.
And in the morning, the old hunter propoeed to the lad to stay with him, unless he thought he could better himself by going further on.
The lad eagerly accepted the offer, and from that day forth had made his home with Adair. He assisted the dd man in the cotton-field, and was his constant companion in the hunt
A strange bond of sympathy existed between the two— the childless, solitary old hunter, and the young, fraJk U» fast at life’s threshold, but friendless and alone.

"Winnie waa stretched out at full length oo the green eward, resting Ms head on his hand, hi* shot-gun lying by hU side. Be was paying no heed to the conversation, but waa idly pulling the Slade* of graas to pleoea, evidently deep in meditation.
Gol glanced from the Ud to the young soldier, a comical {rin upon hi* dried-up feature*.
“ 1Bey*ve both on ’em got It bad,” be muttered, ln an undertone. “I s’pose it’s in the natur* of human* to have H while they're young, jlst a* puppies catch the distemper.

“AD right; where will you got” Winnie asked.
“ ’Bout six miles up the bayou, the ether side of Black-Jack Swamp. Well- start about six to-nlgkt” And then tbe eyes of the old hunter twinkled.
“ Hold on I” exclaimed Winnie, suddenly. “I emn’t go ae early as that”
“ Neln, neither can I,” Peter said, getting very red ln th* (ace again. , “ J cannot go mit you so early as dat"
“ Why, what op alrth is the matter with both on you!" asked Gol, ln affected amazement
“ I have an appointment thl« evening,” the lieutenant explained.
“ Dat ish the matter mit me," the Gsnsan lad confessed, still very red in the face.
" Get him to wait till to-morrow," Gol suggested, very innocently, addressing the soldier; “ and won’t the gentleman wait for you, Pete?” he demanded of th« boy.
“ Ton infernal old humbug! You know very well that it isn’t a him /” Winnie exclaimed.
“And Is your him a fraulin’ too?” Gol asked, of the boy, ootnlcally imitating his tone.
“Yah,"1 replied the youth, laconically.
•* Wal, go it ye cripples!” the hunter Said, encouragingly. ■“ ni hold yer bats. I reckon, though, that you can’t swap tho ducks off for ribbons and sich truck, but maybe ef you let me her the trade I kin. I low I kin whip the world a-swappin’. But What time will you be back, leftenant?”
“ Not before ten; I sha’n’t go up to the landing until after dark. I don’t care about the whole town seeing me call upon the lady," Winnie explained.
“ TfiniW ashamed of her, I s’pose,” Gol said, sympathiser-
“ Go to thunder!” the soldier responded, indignantly.
“ I sw'ar I won’t waste any more sympathy <Sn you, doggone you!" retorted GoL “ And Pete, when air you coming tome?”
“ When she turn me out” the boy replied, honestly.
Both Gol Adair and Winnie laughed at the frank coe/Beaton.
“Wal—I sw’arr Gol exclaimed, after he got- through laughing. “ I never had to be turned out by the gal when i used to go sparkin’. I all or* eould take a hint. All they bad to do was to boot me out two or three times, and then I -tilers understood that my company wasn’t agreeable." And the old hunter laid back and enjoyed a quiet laugh.
“ Wen, as we’re an three going up to the landing, let us ■fo together about sundown,” Winnie suggested.
“Pm yer man,.ss the beaver said when he married the 'muskrat’s sister," was the hunter’s reply. “ I say, leftenant, who do you suppose this critter is hankering arter?”
“ I haven’t an idea,” Winnie replied.
" Tilda Oatok, sbter-te-laW’to YeH."
“ Whew I" exclaimed Winnie, in surprise. “ You had •better be careful, Pete; if you should happen to offend that precious brother-in-law, he’d think nothing of putting a load ■ef buckshot * pluni Into you,’ as bewould say.”

“ Why, do you think that there is say real danger of his attacking Pete?” the soldier asked.
“ W.U, I dunno,” Adair said, with a dubious shake of the bead. “ Just afore he shot Tom Warren, and the cbsae wasn’t so hot arter him, he used to oome in ulgh the landing.

“Wal, you’re *bout right I s’pose,” Adair itwwwi, thoughtfully. “ That poor Tom Warren that he shot was a right proper sort of-man, but I don’t wsnt to be mixed up in it all It’s none of my quarrel, as the ’coon said whs* he dim’ up the gum an’left the wild-cat and tbe black snaks to fight it out on the ground."	^ '
“ Why didn’t old Forsyth tell him to clear out and let his daughter alone? After killing one of the girls, Osark orijgbt to be satisfied.”

“ Then you won’t tell me where his den in the swamp is?"
“ I sw’ar I don’t know, r’aUy,” replied Gol, earnestly. “I suppose I cduld tmeU him out ef I wanted to, bat I don’t.”
“ After he’s riddled the boy yonder with buckshot youU be norty you didn't put your heel on this snake," Wlanle said.
Gol looked after Pete, who bad risen during tbe convocation and walked toward the house.
“ He’d better not tech hlml" the old aanter exclaimed, nervously. “It will be the worst day’s work Yell Osark ever did ef he pulls a trigger on that air boy, I tell yer!"
CHAPTER XV.
JUDGE TILL.
Juft before the little party, consisting of the General, thb sheriff, and the overseer, got to Smlthville, a man came rid* lng out of a gateway by the side of the road and headed toward the town.
This man was short in stature, and decidedly fleshy la build; he had a round, flat face, as rosy and chubby a* tbe face of a ten-year old school boy; It was smoothiy shaven, and a pair of little blue eyes peeped out from the huge wrinkles of flesh which seemed likely some day to close the said eyes up altogether. On his head he wore a glossy brown wig, elaborately curled.' This eould hardly be termed a deception; that it was a wig'wsa clearly evident upon th* slightest- inspection. A broad-brimmed' straw hat shaded his eyes, and he wore a frock-coat and a pair of black doeskisr pantaloons that had evidently seen a great deal of afervica, Both coal a*d pantaloons were extremely loose and* thet fit* He wore no vest, arid' bis 'ihirtrwas ■ throat, innoccnt jf collar or necktie.

Tlil* was the very gentleman that spoken of, Judjje Jack YeU—reputed ,
lawyer, as fine a poker-player, and as good a judge or whisky irdwellwesi of the Mississippi river.
Judge - was about fifty years of age, and bad really retired from practice, although once In a while he would undertake * case, simply, to oblige a friend, and just to keep Us band in, ar he expressed it
« Tttfi the Jedge- now," the sheriff Mid.
'M Let us push on and overtake him," Smith suggested. The clatter of hoofs behind him caught the Judge’s attention, and he turned in the saddle to see who it was. Recognizing the General, he checked his mule and halted until the others came up with him.
11	Good-evening, Judge,” flwitth	ah firing hands
with Tell, as they rode on side by side. In the South the afternoon is generally termed “ evening.”
' “ How’y* do, howy do, Glneral?” the Judge said; he spoke with a very strong South-western accent.
41 Going to the landing?”	-
“ Tea, I reckon so; I head a boat whistle Txrat an hoar back, and it immediately devolved upon my comprehension that tharwas a mail steamer that had arrived." The Judge was noted for using uncommon words and phrases, which he did with • such perfect gravity, that h«lf the time even his mast intimate friends couldn’t teU whether he was joking or in sober earnest. — ■
"It must be the Dardanellee,” the General said; “she was lying at the Bock when I left”
“ I opine that your prognostication is not six degrees windward of the truth," remarked the Judge. “ How are you, Johnson? How is Mrs. Johnson and all the lee lie Johnsons?” be queried oi the sheriff.
“ Finely, thank yon,” replied the sheriff, grinning at the gravity of the Judge’s maimer.
“See hyer. Judge,, we.want you ins little law case. My overseer hyer—Mr. Texas, Judge YelL”
The overseer bowed, while the Judge saluted by whirling his umbrella In the air, thereby starting the sheriff’s hone, so that the brute gave a sudden “ back ” jump which pretty near sent Mr. Johnson on his head.
“ Whoa! you dumed brute I” Cried the sheriff, as soon ss ae recovered his breath, which had been pretty nearly an Jerked out of him by the sudden jump of his beast “ See hyer, Jedge, for heavien’s sake, shet up that air umbrella at keep it quiet Ton’ll have me over the beast's neck, test thing you know, and Tve got a wife and family.”
Tbs Judge looked at the sheriff for a moment, an expression of grave astonishment upon his fiat face.
“ Johnson,” he said, slowly, “ you are a pretty good man, but you’d never do for a hoes-thief. You can’t ride,” and then the Judge sighed, as if sorely grieved. ^	_
“The blazes I can't i” growled the sheriff, in disgust •* I never was throw’d yit I’d like to see the hoes that could—■"
But Mr. Johnson didn’t proceed any further in his speech, for the Judge just at that moment gave a yell that would have done credit to a Choctaw Indian, and waved the umbrella wildly in the air; as a natural consequence, the sheriff’s hone, restive and fractious under the heavy hand of his Blaster, started up the road, plunging, kicking and rearing, and the sheriff, cursing the Judge, the horse, and the umbrella aU together, rode all over the animal from his head to hla tall; but by a miracle almost i*i managed to cling to the hone and escape being thrown.
The Judge indulged in a quiet chuckle aa he watched the reasarkable equestrian performance. Then he turned to the General as gravely aa tf nothing had happened “What is the nature of the case?” he asked.
The three horsemen were riding slowly along together, while sheriff, after calming frf*	was keeping
wen in the advance, out of the way of the Judge’s practical Jokes.
" An assault and battery case. Mr. Texas here was orer-teeing	in the field when black ^oundrpl,
Tongo— Ton know the nig, Judge r The Judge nodded.
“ Well, he came up and Interfered with the handa, tailing them to quit work, and then gave Mr. Texaa here some of his talk, and he just went in and whaled the darky till he couldn't .stand It was the prettiest fight. Judge, that you ever saw. Mr. Texaa here closed up both the nig’a eyea and than give him a clean lick in the bread-basket that knock* ad him smack out of time. Why, when it struck, it sounded mm a tan cottonwoad crackingP’
pfl W*** taka the case, sir!" wntslmsi the Judge, da-
ddedly. MI am-’ an: old man, General Smith; I have bea» your neighbor since we were both- knee-high to a woodchuck, and you have grossly insulted met Tou have lacer-ated my heart In Its inmost interstices! Only a, mils.away and never send for me to witness such a fight! General, it wUl take four fingairuf whisky to make me forpst such a* outrage!" -	.,	:i
Then the General, who at first had listened In astonish ment, suddenly perceived that the .Judge waa joUng as usual.
“ Why, i didn’t last five minutes; he whipped Congo senseless Inside of that time,” Smith explained. “ Well, the black was carried off by his friends, and of course I naturally supposed that the affair wai ended, but the first thing after dinner the sheriff rides up—"	\
“On a fiery steed of the Ukraine breed!” the Judge quoted^ gravely, “ Byron improved!"
“ Tes; and said that he has a warrant for Mr. Texaa* arrest; charge, assault and battery, preferred by King Congo. They mean business, too, Judge; they’ve got Bob Howard their side.”
By this time they had got fairly into the town.
“ Bab’s a pretty smirt young man," the Judge said, slowly; he has the making of a good lawyer ef he’d only let whisky alone. Ah, General Smith! it grieves me to the soul when I see these young men, the rising flower of our country; depend upon vile liquor to stimulate their bratoa. What says Shakspeare, that giant mind that hath written of alt things, and of all things equally wellf ‘ Ob, thou invisible spirit of wine; if thou hast no nsme to be known by„let us call thee devil! Oh, that men should put an enemy ip their mouth to steal away their brains! ’me ouage nsd fcaitea, anff, dropping the reins of his mule, had canted the umbrella bacfc over his shoulder, while, with his right fore-finger upraised, he shook it In the air as if addressing a jury. The other two had also stopped their horses. They had halted directly to front of the Planter’s Saloon.
“ And, General, speaking to this veto also, do you remember the remarkable words of the Ghost of Pocost" .
“ No, I don’t think that I ever heard that," Smith replied, thoughtfully.	• n.
“ Twas to our Mexican campaign; our regiment was quart-ered to an old, half-ruined tower on the outskirts of Monterey, just after the fall of that city. The tower waa haunted by a ghastly ghost, all clad to white. It was supposed to bo the spirit of the former owner of the tower, who was murdered by a jealous rival at a grand banquet, just as he had riseuto speak, with a goblet of wine to his hand. The ghost was troubled; ‘rest, perturbed spirit,’be would not Ha had some dead secret weighing on his mind which he must give to the world ere his bones could ‘lie to the earth.’ No Mexican dared to listen to the fearful story the lips of tha specter must speak. And the first night we lay within the ruined tower the ghost came. I' and a comrade, a warm-hearted Irishman, followed him. Through many a winding passage he went, until at last, to the charnel vault beneath the tower, where the whitening bones lay thick, the specter, spoke. Short the sentence; nor earth nor heaven could gainsay the truth. He said—and It wUl ring to my ears ‘ to the last syllable of recorded time ’—‘ It’s a long while ’tween drinks.’" “ Sold, by thunder!” muttered the General, while Texas roared.
“ Come, light down, gentlemen, and try some whisky with me,” the Judge said, dismounting; then he shouted to the sheriff, who, glancing round, perceived that the party had halted; so he also reined to his steed
“ Oh, Mister Johnson, will you come and astonish your itomach with some good whisky, and yourself by drinking to the company of gentlemen r" the Judge shouted.
“ I won’t come a dumed foot till you shet up that dog goned umbrella," the sheriff replied, defiantly. “ I ain’t a-gwtoe through the city with my hoss a-trying to walk oa his hind legs, like a blamed circus-rider!”
Gravely the Judge shut up the umbrella, then performed a military salute with it
The sheriff rode up and dismounted The party aU “ took a drink," mounted their horses again, and proceeded straigH to the oourt-room, where all was to readiness for Sue trial
OH A PTB-B' XVI. -
AX ARRA'rtaA.B JUSfTICB. ir ■Cm Judge, yielding to Johnson’# persuasions, had not re-•pened -the umbrella, bat had tucked it under his arm, although he-solemnly declared that be should get sunburnt and spoil the freshness of bis complexion, sbd then none of the girls -would love him. Which, considering that the Judge had already kad three wives*, and “ faised” three separata families, amounting in round numbers to about sixteen, waa something really alarming.
“ Who is the case brought before?" the Judge inquired.
“ Foxcroft; you know he was elected last election,” Dm sheriff replied.
“ Ah, yea. I don’t know much about the gentleman," the Judge said. " What sort of a Justice does he make?”
“ I reckon I don't know,” the sheriff answered; “ this hyer is the fast case that has come afore him.”
" He’s not a lawyer, is he?”,
“ No, I reckon aot, I never heered that he waa.”
The Jddge caressed his fat chin for a moment, then broke out into a series of short, dry chuckles.
The sheriff, in alarm, clutched his horse’s rein tighter and east a wary glance at the umbrella. He expected another practical joke, which, Tell noticing, he laughed quietly.
“ Don't be skeered, Mister Johnson,” he said. “Iam perfectly satisfied now that you can ride. In fact, you can do more riding In the same space than any other man that I have erer seen. Host horsemen content themselves with riding on the saddle, but you excel them; you rideaU over the animal, from the ears to the tail.”
AU this was said so gravely that the sheriff thought at first the Judge Intended to compliment him, but the suppressed mirth of the General and Texas soon convinced him that the Judge was making fun of him.
“ Wal, I didn’t faU off, anyway,” he muttered to himself, contenting himself with that reflection.
“ I say, Judge, what can they do in this case, anyway?” the General asked.
“ Oh, not much of any thing. I don’t really understand what they want Congo of course will swear that Mr. Texas here stnck him without any provocation, and—by the way, who witnessed the affair?”
“ No one but the field hands and two or three darkles that came with Conga 1 didn’t see the first of it,” the General •aid.

Bob was the only son of a wealthy planter, who had bean pretty well to do in the world, but since his father’s death the devil-may-care young lawyer had made ducks and drakaa of bis paternal acres.	yth
TTing Congo, with his bead all bound up, was stretched out at full length on the bench, surrounded by a group 'tt < negroes.
Foxcroft looked a Uttle astonished whan he aaw that JndgtrYaB ~wsr n member of the party. He waa not acquainted with the Judge personally, but of course wss wafl acquainted with him by reputation.
“ Mr. Texas, Justice Foxcroft,” said the sheriff, udroduo-ing the dverseer.
“ Hello, Judge I” exclaimed Howard, in astcnlshmeat, jumping up and advancing to YelL 41 Why, what brought you to town?”
“ Mr. Howard, I am really delighted,” replied the Judge, yAing the hand of the young lawyer with stately politeness.
“ I have the honor to represent my esteemed friend hyer, Mr. Texas, In this case, and I can hardly express my feelings of delight that-I am permitted to appear before the bai of justice presided over by the learned and profound gentle man who now sits yonder, but .with whom I have not the pleasure of being acquainted.” And here the Judge bowed gravely to Foxcroft, who felt extremely flattered by the compliment, while Bob Howard had to turn away and stuff his handkerchief In his mouth to keep from snickering in the face of the “learned Justice.” Knowing Judge Tell so thoroughly, and his contempt for storekeeper-justlcee, he understood that the old' lawyer waa in reality poking fun at the court
“ Blamed If I didn’t think you knew the Justice!” Mr. Johnson- exclaimed, annoyed at having been ao forgetful of Ae necessary etiquette, as .sot to Introdnos the Judge to the Justice. He repaired the blunder at coon
“ Jndge TeU, Justice Foxcroft”
The'Judge shook hands with Foxcroft, and In his stately and dignified way lamented that he had never had the plan-sure of meeting him before, and wound up by borrowing a " chew tobacco” from him! Foxcroft expressed his delight at being able to accommodate the Judge.
Then a sudden thought appeared to strike Tell. Hs looked around him reflectively; tapped Ms forehead with his forefinger for a minute, then crossed the room to Howard, and took blm to one corner and -conversed with him there, mysteriously, for a few minutee, to the great wonderment sad awe of nearly alf within the room.
But though the faoe of fhe Judge was as sober as a mourner at a funeral, the communication which he delivered to Howard made that lively young man red in the face with suppressed laughter, and h was only by a greet effort that he re&ainetl from a moet unseemly outburst of merriment
Then the Judge looked around, smiled blandly, and crossing to the table opposite to the one occupied by Howard, laid his hat and umbrella upon It, rad aat down, quietly.
Just at this moment Sam and three field-handi whom he nad selected, came rushing In, puffing and blowing like a .ot of porpoises. It was clear that they had ran aU the way to town.
“ We done got hyer, sur,” Sam said, addressing the General, who motioned the hands to stand over by the wall, back of the table occupied by Judge Tell.
Foxcroft was not at an pleased with the appearanoe of the Judge and General In the overseeraee. The first he knew to be a lawyer, second to nose in the State of AAanaae— or for that matter, In the whole Southern country, and the General was one of the moet prominent citizens for miles around, and he foresaw that there might be trouble in cany* ing out the little scheme that had been concocted to worry Tho-Man-from-Texas.
And aa for King Congo and his black friends, they looked both disgusted and frightened at Judge Yell’s interference. The Judge was something of a mystery to the celored folks generally; his absurd practical jokes bad caused the graatss part of them to leok upon the Judge as being a Uttla craey
“ He brought some other blacks with him, did he, on your place, eh?” the Judge asked, thoughtfully.
«Yj*"
" It looks as If he came for the express purpose of picking a fuss, and-brought bis witnesses along with him,” the Judge said, shrewdly.
“ That’s just what I thought,” the General said
“ A case of simple assault generally amounts to a fine of live dollars or so, but in this case, the complainant being a black, they may make an effort to twist It round as an outrage upon the Freedmen collectively; that Is, that the black would not have been assaulted if he had been a white man. You see. the law is a very curious thing, sometimes; It beau an eel for twisting, aU hollow. But, General, you ought to fcsve brought your witnesses along.”
“They’re coming; I thought of that," the General replied. “ I told Sam to pick out three of the moet Intelligent of the hands who witnessed the affair, and start ’em In to the landing. They’U bis along soon.”
By this time the party had reached Foxcroft’s store. The Temple of Justice represented by the office of tne Justice of the Peace, was situated over the store, and was a mediumsized room, about twelve by fifteen. The accommodations were limited; a couple of pine tables, one large and the other small; four or five chairs, a small, high desk, a high stool, and a long bench, comprised the furniture.
When the little party entered the room, they found Fox-sroft perched up on a high stool behind the desk, diligently engaged in a perusal of Wells’ “ Every man his Own Law-ler," being the only law book that he had beau able to procure 1st town.
Bob Howard, the lawyer, waa seated at the table nearest ths window, with his feet comfortably adjusted upon it, ■noting a cigar.
Howard was a young man of twenty-five or six, about SMdlum sim, with a thin face, keen gray eyes, and hair that Mrisd ta Uttle fiery red ringlets all over, his bead, with the ■Mttit st the extreme top of his pate, which was mm-

TRYING THM CASK.
Foxcnorr had not been able to cxtract much Information bearing upon the present case from the pages of “ Every Man Till Own Lawyer,” but he bad opened it at “ Mlscella. neous Information,” trusting that that might aid him if any knotty point of law should arise during the case. He had, howeVer, mi lo up bis Bind not to expos* Us ignorance, but to let the two lawyers light the case out. He felt sure of one thing, and that was that the overseer had whipped tho darky, iwd that Congo could easily prove it, and, of course, under the law* of the State, be had a perfect right to flue tbs guilty party, although he was not sure how high a fine the law Would justify him in inflicting; but, as he had told Fayette, be thought the law could be stretched a little;"' *"*>,n-
“ Order in the courtl" yelled Johnson, understanding from Foxcroft’* manner that he was ready to hear tbe case.
Howard got up.
“ Your honor, I rise to address you in a most important oase. The dignity and peace of tbe Slate of Arkansas have been violated by the prisoner at the bar— I say, Johnson, old fellow, this is simply shameful, yon know! What have I done to yon that I should be treated in this manner?” Howard cried, suddenly breaking off from the topic of his speech and appealing to the sheriff In an excited manner. “You haven't introduced me to this gentleman yeti" and he point*! to Texas.
Johnson was fat despair.
“tsw'ar, Bob, I clean forgot It!" he exclaimed. “Mr. TexaS'Mr. Howard."
Tnen the lawyer advanced, shook hands politely with the overseer, who hod been accommodated with a chair near Yell’s'table, proffered him a " chew ” from his tobacco-box, and, on its being declined with thanks, retreated to his table and went on with his argument
*	Yes, your Honor, the prisoner at the bar, In defiance of tbe laws of Arkansas and the statutes in such case made and provided, has committed a deadly assault upon one of our most respected citizens, K. Congo, Esq., whereby the life of that eminent and distinguished citizen has been brought In peril and he has suffered great bodily damage. Far be it from me to wish to soar on tbe eagle-wing of otatory in this ease. ( will rest it upon the solid facts which wehave the witnesses here to provo. Sheriff, call James Snow.” Howard referred to a little memorandum which be held in his hand as heapoke/ -;
One of the three darkles who were standing by Congo advanced to the open spaee between tbe Judge’s desk and the table of Tell, where the sheriff was standing.
Old Uncle Snow, as he was generally called, was a noted tautmOm ia Smlthville. He had formerly been one of General Hmtth’s Slaves, but, during the last of the war, ho had started l little' Stont on the outskirts of the town, and was reputed to be doing very well.
The old uegro was generally liked. When Smith had re-lumeu at the end of tbe war, “ Uncle" had offered to come back to Use plantation and help bis old master along, but : Mie General told the old fellow that he had better stick to his •lore.
Andwhen the old darky took the stand, all within the I »oom knew that be would tell nothing but the truth.
He kissed the “book” with great solemnity, evidently 4e-ply impressed with his position as witness.
Now, Uacle Snow, mind, we require you to tell all yon know in regard to this affair,” Howard said, gravely.
' Yes, sari’’ replied the white-haired negro; “ ’fore de Lord, I won’t tell nuflln’ else, sure’s you're born, Massa Howard;’’Tt	Ii.-.
“ Go ahead^ then." j r_..
'• I was a-comta’ along de road by Massa Smith's plantation an’ I met Congo an’ dem oder nigs dere; an’ Congo feted me to gwine wld him a bit An’ I:dld. Den he an’-de overseer hadi a fuss, an’'dat gemnjan dere he fotched Congo de awfulest lick dat I ever see’d struck. Den Congo be girded up his lionaj fur to sail in, an’ den dat gemman fotched him anoder lick, wuss dan de furst; den be smashed him five or six licks in de face ag’in, so quick you couldn’t tee dom, an’ Jen he fotched him a wallop ag’in’ de body dat made Congo’s ribs crack for sure. ' An’ dat's all I know ■bout it.”
" A plufc, straightforward story, your Honor," Howard said “ Now, Uncle,r who struck the first blow?”
“ Dat gemman. ssr,” and tlie negro pointed to Texaa, “ bat Congo Until him an’ made fui to foich him a tick.”
......	......wM'''' ......
“ Did Congo strike at him’”
"No, ear; ’fore de Lord, be didn’t git de chance."
“ That will do,” Howard said, and the negro retired.
The other two blacks were examined, and they told abort the same story as Uncle Snow, except that they stoutly denied that Congo had either “sarsed” th* overseer or had threatened to strike him.
“ The witnesses are yours, Judge,” Howard said, bowing gracefully to Ye’L ’ The Judge recalled the old negro.
“ Now, then, on your oath, did you see tbe | risoner strike the negro with malice aforethought?” cried Y^H, in • voice of thunder, shaking his forefinger in the face of the witness.
“No, sar, I.didn’t see It!” cried the old negti, hurriedly. “ Dat gemman didn’t strike him wld a malice—he stru’k him wid his ban’; dere wAsn’t nuffin’ ln it”
“ No, you misunderstand the Judge,” Howai l said; “hs means did he strike hW with malice prepense.”	V •
Old Uncle Snow was bothered; he scratched lis head for a moment, then answered, slowly:
“ No, sar, I didn’t see any prepense in bis haiU either; hr hit him wld his fist, jlst his bar’ ban’, sar.”
“ This is infamous!" cried Yell, in sudden in lignaticm. “Your Honor, I appeal to you! Is the witness U be badgered by the opposing counsel ii. this manner? It- it disgraceful! An insult to you, Justice, and also to me. In thirty years' practice I have never known such a thing If my learned brother thinks that he can ride over me bees tie I am an old man, I tell him right hyer to his teeth that it can’t be done. I am not to be browbeaten; I am not to be put down. I know my rights, and knowing dare mi Utain!” and tbe Judge banged his fist down upon the tsbli with a force which shook the whole room.
Howard was on his feet in an Instant “ I hurl back the insults of Judge YeH with scojn and contempt A relic of the past, be can not understand the spirit of our ago!’1 howled Howard, at the top of bis va’ce, also banging the table with bis fist
" Does my young and learned brother dare to reflect ujc* my agel” yelled the Judge, brandishing his clenched fit* wildly in the air.
The spectators began to be farmed; none wlthis tbe roon bad ever seen the Judge 10 fearfully excited before, and Bok Howard, too, seemed rc< s whit behind Johnson, the sheriff, prepared himself to jump ln between the two excited men; he saw that there was likely to be a fuss.
" That the esteemed and venerable counsel on the other side Is'in his dotage is plain!" cried Howard, doubling Up his fist and shaking it menacingly at the other.
“ Oh, that I should ever live to be insulted by this miser able scalawag!" groaned Yell “ Who’s a scalawag?”
“You are!”
“ It Is falser “ Defend yourself!"
Tbe Judge grabbed the big lnk-stand on bis table and shied it at Howard’s bead; he dodged, and the missile went smash through the window. Then Howard seized a chair and raised it as if to strike the Judge, whereupon Yell seized the umbrella that lay before him on the' table, and swinging it round wildly in the air, took Johnson, who waa advancing to interfere, an awful lick in the nose, tumbling him over on top of Congo and in among the witnesses who were all huddled together in tho corner, and the result was, that the party all went over in a heap together.
Then Howard, dropping his chair and the Judge his umbrella, rushed together and clinched in the Center of the room, then the Judge threw Howard a “ dog fall," and they rolled over on the floor in a desperate encounter.
It took Smith, Texas, the sheriff, two or three of the negroes, and even the learned Justice from the bench himself, to separate tbe combatants.
Such an uproar had not been heard in Smlthville for many a long day, and tho news that there was a fight going on over Foxcroft’s store, attracted a big crowd on tbe stain and lide the building.

Bowasd and the Judge were separated,. and each resumed his former seat. Strange to say, neither one of Ahem had received any damage, except that the Judge's* wig had come *ff during the skirmish.
FoicToft took his seat upon the “bench” again irlth a solemn face. He bad often heard of the peculiar customs of some of the Far Western courts, but the sample that he ha*. Just witnea.ed rather ostoni hed him, and, to crown his am-fctement, as soon as the Judge recovered his breath, he proceeded in the examination of the witness juat as if nothing unusual lmd occurred.
The sheriff, Johnson, tyid the battered-up Congo, had been the only sufferers in the affray.
Johnson hud a pair of beautiful black eyes and a swelled nose, produced by contact with the Judge’s umbrella, and Coogo bad had all his wounds reopened afresh by Johnson’s bouncing down on him with the force of a battering-ram.
Johnson ;was mad; his eyes and nose hurt He couldn’t very well call the Judge to account, for the lick waa accidental, buVhls glance fell npo'n the crowd pressing in the ■doorway; here-was a chance for him to let off a little surplus steam, so he immediately proceeded to drive the crowd out of the entry, an operation which was by no means agreeable to the members of the aforesaid crowd, and they plainly intimated to Johnson tfcoV they considered that he was putting on. frills; whereupon Johnson, wounded both in feeling and in person, but still remembering his oath of office as sheriff, and knowing that It waa not right to kick up a disturbance and annoy the court, succeeded in getting the crowd out of the doorway, so that he could close the door, and in the passage proceeded to “ interview ” the man who had insinuated that be was Indu’gtng in “ frills.”
“ What part r.f the body did Congo strike Mr. Texas, when he hit him before Mr. Texas hit him?” the Judge said, sternly.
The negro was bothered.
“ I dun no, Massa Judge; I didn’t see him fotch him a lick it alL”-
“ Why, did I not understand you to say that Congo raised bW arm and at ruck Mr. Texas!"
“ I didn’t see’d him hit him; he raised his arm, dat's-aU.”
“ Posrlbly you turned away your head?" the Judge said, insinuatingly.	-
“ I d'jono, sar.” The black was perplexed; he was trying to meal', the whole affair, and the more he thought about it the-more uncertain he became.
*' Now, on your oath!” thundered the Judge, “ can you swi>ar that you did not turn your eyes for a second while Congo-struck Mr. Texas? Remember you are on your oath, sir," and the Judge, leaning over the table, shook that awful forefinger solemnly in Uncle Snow’g face.
•' I mought ’a’ winked, Massa, an’ den he hit him an’ I didn't sce’d It,” the old negro said, slowly.
Biff—bangl from the entry; smash! open came the door, disclosing a free fight in the entry with Johnson, the sheriff, revolving around in the center of it. He was getting satisfaction for his black eyes.
Justico, council, witnesses and prisoner—all made a rush to assist Mr. Johnson.
The reinforcements proved too much for the intruders, and one grand charge drove them down the stairs Into tin street.
Then the victors returned again to the court-room. John* son was as pt;oud as a peacock with two tails.
“ 1 reckon that thar’s one man in this hyer city that won’t ■ay I put on frillsag’lnr’ he muttered, now perfectly satisfied.
Tlio Judgo “ went for" the other witnesses, and succeeded In mixing tht'.r statements up so that when he got' through w|th them tiiey were ready to swear to almost any thing.
Then he brought up the three field-hands. They had 11s-teased to the evidence and were perfectly satisfied that they •ad seen Congo strike the overseer first, and swore to it like men and heroes.
Then Bob Howard took them in hand and put them through a cross-examination, and by the time he got through they had testified that Congo had Btruck the overseer s half dozen times at the least before the overseer had retaliated.
Of course by this time the affair had got pretty well mud* Aedap. .:
■ Howard courteously gave the Judge the privilege sf “ramming up" last and wen* ahead.
“Tour Honor,'tfie case fa as dear as the waters of ths Arkaisas!" The Justice' reflected just then that the water of the Arkansas wasn’t very clear about that time. "I think ihat we have fully proved the assault by competent witnesses, ■and the clear and straightforward manner In nVhieh they have testified Is worthy of the highest pnissu?
Here the negroes looked at each other and scratched theb beads in wonder. They Were laboring under th» impression that they didn’t know much about the affair, anyway.
•* I move for sentence, and that it shall be so heavy as to strike terror to the soul of the dastardly perpetrator as well as to the heart of th* ghoul-like lawyer who dares to come Into this court and attempt to defend such » fiendish outrage.” ■ i.i;	«;:?
“Ghoul is too muchl”-yelled the Judge, rising in?rage. “Tm your man, Bob Howard!” •
Then, with a Wild war-whoop, the Judge attempted in spring upon his opponent, but Smith and Texas grabbed him by. the coattails, and as the cloth was yood his hostile design was baffled.	. .f ,
Howard bad leaped up about three feet to the air. and re sponded with a yell equally as fierce, but the sheriff hac thrown both arms around him and hold on for dear life>.
The eagei crowd in the street once more rushed up-stalrs. The court of Justice Foxcroft beat a circus all hollow: that day.	•. » im?a!w
“ Gentlemen! gentlemen! for Heaven’s sake, calm yourselves; respect the dignity of the court!” Foxcroft cried. Is alarm, looking over his desk at the struggling men, panting like wild beasts to get at each other.	.
Like oil upon troubled waters was the speech of the. Justice. In a second the raging lions became as turtle-doves; they retreated to their table and bowed with humble respect to the Justice.
He could hardly believe his eyes. He could make neither head nor tail of these astonishing transactions.
Tell sat down and Howard went on in his speech.
“ I submit the case,” he said, “ without further argument Words are useless when facts are so clear.” Then he bowed to the Justice arid turned to the Judge. “ I yield now to my learned and esteemed friend, Judge Ten” Howard bowed gracefully to the Judge and sat down. Tell returned the bow and got up.
“ As my young and estimable brother in the law, Mr. Howard, has remarked,” then he bowed to Howard, and that gentleman, rising for a moment, returned it with great ceremony* “ the facts in the case are clear. The complainant goes upon the grounds of my esteemed, friend, Genera Smith, without leave or license, thereby committing a tr§i pass. When warned to go, he refuses. He uses wordsail culated to create trouble among the laborers of Genera; Smith, thereby exciting a riot He uses blasphemous words breaking the statute framed against the use of oaths thereby. He raises his arm to strike, or does strike General Smlth’i overseer—the .intent Is enough, although we clearly prove the blow—and he, believing his life to be in danger, used gentle force—as these intelligent Witnesses have fully testi fled,” and he waved his hand toward Smith’s. three field hands, who grinned at the compliment “And then the complainant, with designed malice, throws himself backward on the ground and with his head and sfcbuldera plovxd s ridge in It a foot long and at least six Inches deep, as hai been sworn to under oath. If a person puts a fence on, or plow the land of another, he fi> liable for trespass, whetbe» the owner has sustained injury or not Tou’U find it it Wells’ book, page 291, fourth paragraph,” be said to the Jus tice. Tell’s memory was something wonderful “If the General takes my advice, he will at once commence a suit against the complainant in this case. He has good grounds. Any jury In the world could have but one opinion on this subject But I see that I need spyak no more; your intelligent' mind must see the issue as it fa, stripped of all disguises. The right of self-defense—of the subject to bear arms and to use them—fa now 99 trial. I cannot doubt what your decision will be; the Latin of Horace covers it, * Ex nihilo nihU JU,' ” (nothing comes of .nothing), ,
Foxcroft did not understand Latin, and bowed graciously at what be supposed whs a compliment, while Hr-vard was stifling with suppressed laughter.
“ I find (he prisoner guilty, and sentence him to pay a tea of two hundred dollars.”
CHAPTER XIX.
SHARP PRACTIC1I.
<>■■«.■ - w.. a general murmur of astonishment in tbs oourt-room at the sentence of the Justice.
Tiro hundred dollars was an outrageous fine for a simple assault, even if the blame in the affair had been aU on one aide.-
Howard rose to Ms feet It was evident from Ms faoe that he was about to say something in regard to the sentence, possibly instruct the Justice that nowhere in the law could he find authority for Inflicting such a heavy fine.
But, just as the young lawyer opened Ms mouth to speak, Judge YeH gare a short, dry cough, and winked at Mm significantly with Ms left eye.
Howard was quick to take a hint, so he contented himself with bowing politely to the Justice, as if to express his satisfaction with the sentence and as if he had risen for that parpose alone. Then he sat down.
Judge Yell got upon Ms feet very slowly.
He bowed with, dignity to the Justice.
Your Honor,” he said, smiling blandly, “ while I must express my astonishment that your able mind, with its pro* found and august store of legal learning, would become con* vtoced of the guilt of the defendant in this case, wherein trembha in the balance the welfare of the citizens of this great and glorious State of Arkansas, still I am sure that your cognizance has discovered some important issue in the case aforesaid which has escaped my humble notice; I therefore take this occasion on behalf of my client to express to you my sincere thanks that you hare dealt so tenderly and gently in this case and levied so low a fine as two hundred dollars, when, with your knowledge of the statutes in such eaaet made and provided, you might with equal justice have fined Mm five hundred dollars. But after such a fine, one learned in the law can not help applying to yiur Honor the Hne that iBneas spoke when last he saw Queen Dido: ‘ Fix* ft prtlerea nifiQ P ” (A *oke and nothing more.)
Foicroft bowed; he hadn't the slightest knowledge of Latin, and from the grave dignity of the Judge, imagined Umself highly complimented
But Howard, who understood the verse, only saved himself from a violent burst of laughter by going into a tremendous fit of coughing.
Then the Judge went on again.
“And, your Honor, I hare but one request to make, and that is, that you will suspend the execution of the sentence for ten minutes while I retire for the necessary papers.” Foxcroft hadn’t the remotest idea what the Judge wanted with “ papers," ss the case was settled; but, supposing it to be some legal form, he, with a look of profound wisdom, replied that It gare Mm a great deal of pleasure to be able to comply with any wish of the Judge.
Yell bowed, murmured his thanks and withdrew; first whispering to the General to follow.
Howard wondered what the old fellow was up to now, while the sheriff, Johnson, confidentially informed the Justice that he “ reckoned the old cuss was dry,” and had gone out to “wood-up.”
In about three minutes a young negro came in with a message tor the sheriff, and that officer informed the Justice that he’d “ be back in a minute,” then followed the boy out Fire—ten minutes more passed away and neither the Judge nor Johnson returned	■ •	’
Foxcroft began to be impatient, and finally after about half an hour had elapsed and the twilight began to darken, showing the near approach of night, he sent one of the wit-nesses out to hunt up the sheriff.
In ten minutes mors, just ss Foxcroft had sent out after candles, the sheriff returned and in his hands he held a lot of papers, which looked decidedly legal in their nature.
“ What kept you so long?" Foxcroft asked Impatiently. The sheriff wsa apparently considerably mixed up in Ms mind
“ See hyer, Justice, this is gwine to be the worst fuss I aver did see!” Johnson exclaimed
Just then lighted candles were b&faght in and by their aid Johnson’s face waa discovered to wear a look of extreme bewilderment
“ What’s the matter?" asked Foxcroft, hurriedly; a dim aMpitton that there wss trouble ahead occurred to him.
“ Thai durned old cuss, Jedge Yeni” exclaimed the
“What’s Jhe matter with the Judge?” Howard asked
“ Well, that boy Who esme for me said somebody waatc* : to see me over to your office, Mr. Howard; and I wot errs* thar, and found that the old Jedge had taken possession and was writing away for dear life. • He looked- at ms and said, '■ ' Mr. Johnson, I believe, sheriff of the county f In course,
I yelled right out; it tickled me, ye see, fur th* Jedge to pretend not to know me, but be jest gi*n me ona leok, an’ I didn’t feel a bit like laughing arter that The Jedge Ida put Ms lee tie squint-eyes right through * feller whan ha means business. * Mr. Johnson,’ he sed, ‘I wfil thank yen not to indulge in any onseemly bijinks in my court1 Hs didn’t say hijlnks, but M-sometMn’; one on them big words that the Jedge uses. Well, I kinder opened myeyes at that, an’I sed: * You aint a Jedge now, are yoo, Jedge?* He sung out, savage as a bob-tailed wildcat, ‘ Yes, sir, I am a oounty Judge, duly letted by the voters of Franklin county, and my term of office has not yet expired’ Then he turned to Gineral Smith an’ sed, ‘ How, Gineral, go ahead with your statement an’ HI issue the warrants for the arrest of all the parties concerned in this high-handed outrage upon your rights.’ An’ the long -an’ short o’ the matter is that rve got to arrest this hyer hull court, including myself, and I sw’ar I don’t know how I'm goto’ to do that!” And then Johnson scratched his head in great perplexity.
“ Shall I examine the papers, Justice?” Howard aaked, his tone very earnest and his face very grave. “1 am afraid that we have put our foot into it, in this case. The Judge knows the law; he was Judge of the county for two terms, eight years, and waa elected for a third term just before the war broke out, but how he can claim that he is still a county judge puzzles me.”
“ fit you will have the kindness,” Foxcroft said Ms voice just a Uttle shaky. Howard’s manner had alarmed him.
Then the lawyer took the papers from the sheriff and proceeded to examine them.
“ This paper is directed to you, Judge," Howard said, opening the first document and looking at it by the light of the candle. “ It’s an injunction granted on the petition of Leonidas W. Smith to restrain Job Foxcroft from acting af Justice of the Peace for the county of Franklin. Grounds upon wMch the petition is based are that your election waa Ulegal, fraudulent votes having been cast, and that the eleo-tlon is now being contested The injunction ties you up, Justice; you can’t do any thing until you have it dissolved” “ I knew that the other party claimed that there were illegal votes cast, but I didn’t know they had taken any measures to contest my election,” Foxcroft said slowly.
“ And these four are warrants for the arrest of Job Foxcroft, Robert Howard Sheriff Lemuel Johnson, and King Congo, on charge of conspiring together in a malicious prosecution against Francis Texas, damages laid at twenty thousand dollars. By Jove, Justice, this is serious business 1” cried Howard, jumping up ai he spoke.
“ But they can’t prove U!” exclaimed Foxcroft, growing a shade wMter.
“I don’t know, Justice,"Howard said, doubtfully. "Old Yell knows what he’s about You see, you stretched that fine like thunder. Fifty dollars was really all the law would allow you in a case like this.”
“What are the rest of the papers?” asked Foxcroft, nervously.
“ Warrants for my cUent, there, Congo,” Howard replied “ First charge, assault and battery; second trespass on Smith’s premises; third, conspiracy with intent to create a riot; fourth, false imprisonment, preferred by Mr. Texas, damages, five thousand dollars; fifth, using oaths in public thoroughfares.”
Congo got up off the bench in horror at hearing this list al
; “ See hyer; I ain’t gwine to bar* miffin' more to do wid dis yeret” he exclaimed, addressing Foxcroft
“ The old Judge is on the war-path,” Howard said grave-ly;^-*ndl see on the back of my warrant the Judge haa done me the honor to pencil his claim to sit He was elected in 1861 to serve four years: the war came in sixty-one, and he claims that until the close of the war in sixty-five his functions were suspended; and at that.time he had still over three years to serve, making Ms time expire to sixty-nine. He strengthens his position by quoting to Latin phrase, * Inter orma.leges silent.' (In the midst of war laws are silent1)
■ Howard translated the phrase for Foxcroft’* benefit
“ But wfll the law of Arkansas sustain such a position?" “That will require a trial to decide," the lawyer replied, doubtfully; “and as the ‘law’s delays' are proverbial, II will be perhaps three to Are years before the mm ea» be d*
^ded.;The Judge here says that General Smith is willing ito oompromise the matter. Tou fine Mr. Texas one dollar iadooeta in this case, and we conjointly to pay the costs of the other, issuing warrants, etc.”
Gladly Foxcroft Jumped at the oiler, and_so th* great «rsrseer case waa settled.
CHAPTER XX.
M ,	A* ADTAHC* a roac*. :-u
Kioht had come, and the “city” of Smithville was plunged in gloom, for though the stan wen bright in the heavens, the moon had' not yet risen.
About half-past seven Gol Adair, Datch Pete, and Lieut* sunt Winnie, rode into the' main street of the “ Landing," •ad halted to front of the store kept by Foxcroft.
“Hyer’s whar I’m' gwine to 'stop,” Got said, as h* reined to hi* horse, and the others followed his example.
Gol had half a dozen ducks slung over his arm.
“ I reckon I can make • trade for what I want; but I ■•spectthat this yere store don’t hold what you’re arter, Pete.” Then Gol happened to look at the window, and a lot of gaudy ribbons there displayed caught his eye.
“ Wal,1! don't know 'bout that either," he said, dubiously. “Ef it's ribbons yei arter, thar’s a pretty good •show." r<t’ : •»;
“ Ya, dat is goot,” Pete replied, tocotaicaHy. He diamounted as he spoke, undoing the knot of the hitching strap which was coiled around the horse’s neck.
“ I kinder ’spect that the old fat cuss don’t keep the truck that you’re arter, leftenant,” Gol remarked, with a grin. “ I sever see’d any feminine ganders ’round his shanty.”
“ No, I 4 reckon ’ not,” the soldier replied, Imitating the eouth-western twang of the other. “ Well, take care of yourself; I’ll be home about ten.” Winnie then gathered up the •teins of his horse.
i “ Look out for yourself, leftenant; keep yer eyes open— Way'*e some other critter may be shlnin’ ’round the gal, an’ toy fur you in the dark!” Gol exclaimed, as the young soldier rode off.
Winnie only laughed, but did not reply.
“ Poor lonesome little girl!” he muttered as he rode on; ■“ there isn’t much danger of my having a rival in this case. The noble young bloods of this extensive city, whose piinci-pal occupations are whisky-drinking and loafing about tbe saloons, would look with holy horror upon the idea of marry tog this Yankee school-ma’am, who has left home-and friends <0 come down to this desolate region to teach the blacks.”
Vainly speculating upon the reception that he would meet, the lieutenant rode on until at last he halted ta front of a little whitewashed shanty, occupied by Mercie Adams, the «chool-teacher.
Through the Uttle window shone a dim light
She is at home," he murmured, as he dismounted from ills horse; and then, leaning his arm upon the saddle, he looked around him vacantly, not that be feared danger, or apprehended that his movements were watched; and yet the face of the young soldier was quito pale; and, although the air of the night wss warm and full of balmy perfume, -coming from the opening blossoms in the little'thicket near toy, Winnie felt a cold shiver pass otfer him, and upon putting his hand U> his brow, discovered that it was damp with perspiration.	'.
The truth must be told—the lieutenant «ea» afraid. The faring soldier who had donned the array-blue at the com-•meneement of the war, as a private in the ranks, and had fought his way up to the grade of major of volunteers, and then at the close of tbe war had passed the examination, and received the commission of lieutenant, in the regular army, now trembled at the very thought of facing the young girl whom he was sure that he loved better than all the world oeside.
For fully five minutes Winnie stood st.il by the side of hla 'horse, his heart beating bo violently that he could plainly ■count the throbs.
Then,'with a determined effort stilling his agitation, he fastened his hone by the strap to the brush fence, and walked holdly to the bouse.
“ Why should I fear the woman I love?" he muttered, as fce rapped on the door. “ She can but say no, and then It’s «A ***». Z may as well know my fate first as last”
After he rapped there vro ai faom^ of stieuoej ths« fc heard the rustle of a woman’s dress and a voice.
“ Who is it?” she asked, her words low, but Him loiil
.......
“ Lieutenant Winnie."
For three or four minutes there was silence; neither Its girl within tie housetfor the man at the door moved.
Then suddenly the rustle of the dress came again to thji ears of the soldier; then followed the noise of a bolt, and the-grating turn of a key in the lock; the door opened and the girl appeared.	'■	1 l,; A
But though the door stood wide open, and the giri had drawn back to give him room to enter,' thus mutely inviting him by deed, if not by word of mouth, yet the young soldier sesftated. *•'« \	‘U >*• x.'
The girt noticed the hesitation. Her Sue was paler thaa usual, and an expression of care and deep thought was plainly visible upon it For a mordent the girl seemed fa doubt She glanced into the frank and honest face of tbe young soldier, then cast her eyes thoughtfully to the ground, and then suddenly seemed to come to a determination.
■ Won’t1 Vou come'in?"sheaskfed.
“ I oeg your pardon, Miss Adaris, but did you reoerre my letter?” be demanded, Impulsively.
The girl looked at tom for a moment; again her oyss sought the ground;’ she was evidently confused.
“ Yes, I received it,” sLe answered, slowly.
“I know that I am acting a great deal like an Idiot Just now,” Winnie said, blushing to hls temples, and feeling <k ddedly'uncomfortable; “but perhaps what you have to say to me can be said just as well with me standing here, and—" and here the young soldier’s voice failed him, and he broke down in a most helpless manner.
The girl looked at him just a second In silence, then tbe cold blue eyes seemed to soften, and just a little bit of a smile appeared on her lips.	' ■'u*,
“ Mr. Winnie, I can not permit you to stand there while I give you an answer. I am sure that would be treating you very badly indeed, and you have been too good a friend tt me for me to treat you in such a manner. Please come In," and as she sj/oke the girl retreated a Btep from the door.
“Yes, but you don’t understand!” Winnie blurted out; “if yon have any thing disagreeable to say, why, the moment you get through saying it, I can jump on my hone and be off, and there’s an end of the affair.”
“ I hope that, no matter what 1 may be obliged to say, It will not make us strangers to each other." Miss Adams spdke earnestly.
“No, Of course not,” Winnie stammered. “ Tm sure,that I would be willing to do any thing ln the world for 705."
“ Except come in when I ask you," she added, quiokly, smiling as she spoke.
“ But can’t ^Ou say ‘ yes ’ or * no ’ right away, and put me out of my misery?” he pleaded
“ You do not care, then, which it is, so long as I answer, eh Vi
“ Now you know better than that!"
“ Yes, but do come in. I can not give you your answer fa one little word."
“ If I coma In, I shall be under the impreusioik that you will give me a favorable answer," he told, hla face lighting up with a.hopeful smile.	'. '
' “ You must not blame me then if you are disappointed," ske replied, archly.
“By Jove, 1 wont be frightenod!" he cried, suddenly, and with an air of determination. Then he went fa and dosed the door behind him.
As he removed his doak and hat, and sat down fa the chair she brought, he noticed that his letter lay unfolded upon the table. She had evidently been reading It when, he knocked, and his heart drew a favorable augury from the circumstance.
“ Mr. Winnie, do you know that I think thst you must be a great coward in reality to be so afraid of a poor little womanlike myself And as ehe spoke she satr down by the aide of the table, and rested her arm upon, theopen letter.
“Well, that is easily explained," he replied, honestly. “When I rapped, you hesitated befsre you asked'who > was; and then, too, 1 should really think that it'woufd be us pleasant for a lady to refuse a gentlemaUwhom thcrtfpsctsd, even If her heart did not Incline to him. I feel pretty sure, you see, Miss Mercie, that you do respect me, though you may not think enough of me to give a favorable ansvas t* the question which I asked to my letter. I feared that M
answer woald be ‘no,’ and I thought that if if-was to be my Di-fortune to hear it, by remaining outside it would be leee painful to ase and leas unpleasant to yon."
I HAPTER XXI.
‘TUB TAJTRTBB SCHOOL-»LA’AM.
Thx girl looked at the young soldier for a moment, just a little bit of wonder in her face.
“I see that you don't understand," he said, ” let me explain. It's only a few feet .from my chair here to the door; three or four steps would take me outside, but my military experience baa taught me that it is extremely difficult for a beaten arm* to, make a successful retreat, but if you do say
*	no,’ I shofi.be so completely demoralised that I am sure my retreat will be a complete rout.”
" Hadn't you better retreat before you begin!" asked .the schoolmistress, smUlng in the face of her iotfer.
" Oh, no, that is Impossible now I” he exclaimed, earnestly; “ like the hero of the ancient tragedy, ‘ returning were as dious as to.g».o’e&.’"-
‘“Ho either (eui bU tote too muck,
.	Or hU desert'* too small,
■	That puts it not onto the toooh
To jla or loss It all,'"
she repeated, still smiling.
u “Those are my sentiments exactly I” he exclaimed, quickly.
You noticed that I hesitated before I replied to your haock?” she asked, abruptly, changing the subject.
.-rJ'Tee." ■
glDft you see those bullet-holes?” and the girt pointed to the door, in the upper part of which were three or four little .sound boles about the size of a revolver bullet.
Winnie got up from his chair- and examined the marks, with considerable astonishment manifested in his face.
‘ATheaeare bullet-holes!” he exclaimed, in amazement ...« Yee; did you have any doubt upon the subject?”
“ I thought that you were joking?”
« Come and sit down again and I will explain why I hesitated to open the door."
Winnie resumed his seat.
[> I had been here just two weeks, and you can judge how lonely ( was when I tell you that there were only some three or four white people who condescended to notice the negro school-teacher In the whole village; one of my scholars had about frightened the life out of me, that afternoon, by informing me that be had heard some of the young men at one of the-saloons debating upon the propriety of warning me to leave town. That evening, about half-past eight or nine, I sat sewing, just where you sit now. I confess I wasn’t doing much work, for my eyes were blinded with tears half the time as I thought of my cozy little New England home, and then reflected that I was so many miles from that home away doivn here in this heathen country. And then, just as I was meditating upon whether there was any danger that the high-toned gentlemen of this place would think proper to molest a ielpless and unprotected woman, I heard the clatter of hones’" hoofs; then they halted, and I heard a coarse voice ,cry out, ‘ Kiddle the cursed shanty f and then the bullets (came. rattling against the house and some came through the dour.' I sunk down upon my knees; I don’t suppose that I am a *ety religions girl, but I prayed then with my whole bean, for I thought that my last hour had come; but, after they fined the ahota, they gave a load yell and galloped
" The eursf” muttered Winnie, in contempt.
*• Yes, it wasn’t a very brave act for men to perfona, bat It really rvauhed in good to me, for naturally the young men boasted of their bravery; it was the talk of the whole village the ceit mprning, and I was surprised by a visit from six or eight of the leading men of the village at noon, in my. schoolroom, headed by General Smith and Mr. Fayette, the banker. They made all sorts of apologies for the cowardly act, and Mid' that I mustn’t think the inhabitants of the city at large countenanced such Infamous proceedings—they call this p>ace a city, you know. And both General Smith and Mr. Fayette tendered me the offer of a room in either of their avusesaa long as I should stay here. Of course I thanked t'&em for their kindness, but, declining their offer, I told fatem I preferred t« remain in my own little home.’’
“ Pluck I” exclaimed Wiwue. m admiration.
' 11 Kb, stubbornness," Mercie replied. “ If I had bee* Isl alone I should have gone away, for I waa so lonesome and homesick, but, after the cowardly attack, I determined that they should not frighten me away. They might kill me if they liked, but I would not fly from their threata.’.’
'■ Have you ever been troubled since then?”
<*No; the attitude that .General Smith and five or six of the other leading men of the village took had something to do with it, I suppose.”
“ But you thought that there was danger threatening when yon heard me ride up to-night T"
“ Yes; this afternoon old Unde Snow came to the school house, just as I had dismissed-the scholars, and told me that I must be careful, for he had heard talk among the negroes that threats had been made against me again, and teat some of the blacks would 'like to come np armed and watch my house every night if I was willing. Of course I told them that I did not wish them to do that, but if he was sure that there was any danger I woujd send for General Smith.”
“ And have you sent for the General?”
“ Not yet. I shall send to-morrow morning.” .
What ever induced you to leave your northern Vees to come down to this half-civilized country T” asked Winnie, to amazement.
“ Money,” was the candid reply. “ I am poor; my father was wounded in the war and is a cripple for life; my little sister and mother have managed to get a sewing-machine and so supported the family. I am not strong enough to earn my bread in that way, and when I got the chance to teach I regarded it . in the light of a blessing, even though I had to leave home and friends and come to this place where I am almost as much alone as if I were on a desert island. I ant only engaged for a year, and when my time is np I shall be able to carry quite a nice sum of money home, for I get a very good salary indeed; I shouldn’t have come if I hadn’t ”
“ At the end of the year you will be free?"
" Yea.”
“ Well, I can offer yon a situation then," Winnie said, soberly.
“ A situation!” Mercie exclaimed, in surprise.
“ Yes; I’ll give you your board and clothes and spending money to do housework for me for all the rest of your life, and pay a minister to seal the bargain besides.”
The schoolmistress laughed.
“ You don’t know much about me,” she said.
“ And you don’t know much about me,” he replied; "so we are even there.”
" And you are a soldier."
“ Is that an objection?"
“ Yes; I wil^ never many you ss long as yw are to the army,” she said, firmly. “ When I marry I want a little home of my own, even if it is no larger than this.”
“ You’re right,” he rejoined, thoughtfully; “ the wife of a soldier has to choose between herhnsband and a home; she can not have both. Well, I’ll resign, and I can with honor too. There’s a bill now in Congress to reduce the army to peace footing, and the officers who choose to resign will be allowed quite a handsome sum, about a year’s pay, I believe. I am a carriage-maker by trade. We’ll select some pretty town; I’ll start a wagon-shop and settle down. Will thar do»n
“ I haven’t said ‘ yee ’ yet,” she protested, smiling.
“ Ah, but I know that yon mean to say it or you would have said ‘ no ’ long ago,"
“ It must be nearly nine,” she said, abruptly; “ If any one should see you leave the house what a scandal it woult* create. ”
“ Not if I could proclaim myself your	husband
come now, you must say yes.”
“ Well, if I must, I suppose I must: j*s/" and then, witt a sad smile, she held up her lips to be kissed.
Half an hour afterward the young soldier departed, feeling extremely happy.
The girl watched him from tho open doorway until eves the sound of bis hone's hoofs died away to the distance, then closing the door listlessly behind her, ahe resumed bet •eat bythe table and gave way to dreamy meditations.
From the reverie she waa rudely aroused. The doo* swung suddenly open, and an ugly little man bristling wUft weapons strode into I he room. The intruder was Yell OboiSs, the Arkansas outlaw!	*
CHAPTER XXII.
TRiPPKD BT A WOMAN.
Tu» girl raised net eyes in astonishment when the out-few entered the room bo abruptly, but she did not rise from her chair.
Ozark banged the door behind him; then drew a revolver from his breast, cocked it, and leveled the shining tube ftreetly at the girl’s head.
Coldly the blue eyes of the girl gleamed, bat she did not qaiver nor even move, her face was like marble, so ooldand white.	''
" Fou're the Yankee school-marm, I reckon I" cried the outlaw, bointerously.
"lain Mias Adams, tho school-teacher,” the girl answered, cold aa an iceberg, and not betraying, the least sign of
fear.
. _ “ And you’re come down hyer fur to'teach the nigs, doggone tliar black hides!” exclaimcd the ruffian, fiercely.
“ 1 teach a colored school,” Mercie said, and just a little tinge,of red appeared on her pale cheek^s*-•*'
“ An’ that’s what’s the matter I” Ozark exclaimed, facetiously. “ Do you know who I amf”
“ 1 do not think that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing you before,” the girl replied, coolly, calmly, and with perfect self-possession.
The outlaw was staggered by the girl’s calmness. He had expected a torrent of tears and pitiful supplications for mercy; but, instead, the girl looked him full in the eye, never quivered at the sight of the leveled revolver, although It was perfectly apparent that a single motion of his finger would send the leaden ball crushing through her forehead.
. “ Wal, you’re a cool band, my beauty, anyhow t” Ozark muttered, and just then he caught sight of a glint of fire in the cold blae eyes, and a single tremor of the thin lips, which warned him as plainly of danger as though the signs had been translated into words.
“ Look out! don't try that!” the outlaw ejaculated, hurriedly. " I kin put a ball plum through you before you kin w'qk. if I feel, like it!”
" Don’t try what!” asked the girl, moving neither hand i-jr foot, but the ominous light still shining in b«r eyes.
•* What you’re thinkln’ about You can’t play any tricks upon me, I reckon!”
“ 1 have not thought of playing any tricks upon j’oa," the girl replied, a contemptuous look upon her face. “ 1 was only thinking what a mean, cowardly ruffian you must he.” Had the girl risen from her seat and struck him i« the face with her thin, white hand, despite the threat of the lev e!cd revolver, Ozark could not have been more astonished than he was at the scornful words.
He shook his head for a moment In wonder, just as the ouffalo-bull does when the leaden hall of the hunters rattles .gainst his iron-like frontlet.
“ Wal, now, you’re kinder hoopin’ it up lively, ain’t yer!” ao exclaimed, In profound astonishment. “ You’re jist the (arciest gal, I reckon, that I ever did run across! Look ever! don’t you know that all I hev to do Is to pull the trigger of this hyer pop-gun and thar’U be one nigger school-o.*rm the less In Arkansas!”
' " I am not at aU afraid of you," was the scornful retort; “ It requires courage to commit a murder, and I do not believe that the man who Is coward enough to bully and threaten a defenseless woman can possess nerve enough to risk the gnllows.”
•• 1*11 be dog-goned if I hav’u’t a good mind to put a hole li^bt plain through you fur bein’ t- > dumed sarcyl” cried the outlaw, exasperated. “Looka-hyer! 1’mYoll Ozarf?, I ami I'm the terror of this hyer State, and I’ve wiped out more men than I’ve got fingers and toes.”
If the outlaw had cxpccted that the announcement of his tame ana, deeds would strike terror to the heart of the girl be was woefully disappointed.
Not a muscle of her face changed. Steadily she looked the outlaw’s face, scorn in the curl of her lips, and unwanted courage In the gleam of her eyes.
T’m the man that bis never gurrer.rtprcd'" he continued, tto«tfully, “ an’ I don't mean to, either. 1 have fit the uurnrti Yankee Government single-handed, an’ 1 ain't whipped yit All I want is my double-barrel an' a handful of buckshot, an* I kin whip my weight in wildcats every time. I kin Jest salivate ’em, I kin!"
■*' if yp'J can fight as well as vou can talk, you must be a terjr doughty warrior,'" the girl retorted, contemptuously.
- See flyer, young gni; yoo’re Jlst temptin’ Providenac a-sarcin’ me in this hyer wayl” the outlaw said, quite' sen ously. " Ef I had really come fur to wipe yon out, I wouldn't hev stood so much Jaw from you; 'sides I’d ’a’ had my gun along. I never travel fur without that we’pon, but I've just dropped in fur to guv you a friendly call like, at a lee tie bit of a warnin'. I fight men, I do, not wimmea folks.”
" As I said before, I am not at all afraid of you," M*rci •gain reminded him..,. ,:,
“Wal, I reckon you’re got tlu;grit.of a wlld-catl" ex claimed Ozark, just a little bit of admiration in his voice “ An' now for -business,” Ozark said; “ I've constituted my self a committee of one to request' you to d’ar out of these hyer parts. The nigs know too much now, an’ I’ve Jest made up ray mind to shet up all these hyei dumed school houses, an’ now 1 jest warn you to git up an' dust."
“ You mean that you wish me to go away from Smith Tiller
“ That's my platform r “ And if I do not go?”
“ I’ll put a load of buck-shot clean through you some of these hyer momln’s when you’re gwlne to your durned old school-housel” cried Ozark, fiercely, and, as he spoxe, he let down the hammer, of the revolver and thrust the weapon
Into his belt
“ And you order me away because I teach the negroes?”
“ Yes; the dog-goned nigs knbw too much a’rpady. I'm jist gwine to stop the hull thing. Tve made np my mind to snei up every nigger school In this hyer county, ef It takes me all my time to lay in, the bush an’ shoot the teachers,” Ozark said, with an air of determination. “ I reckon, though, that I won’t have to do that, for I ’spect my warnin’ to quit will be enough."
*• Do you ever read your Bible?” the girl asked, suddenly.. The outlaw stared at the question.
“ Wal, I reckon I ain't got slch a thing,” he had to an-SWcT.
“ Let me give you one."
The girl rose from her seat, opened *ie drawer of the table, which was between her and the outlaw, drew out a revolver, cocked it in a second, and leveled It fuU at the breast of the outlaw.
For almost the first time In his life Ozark was cornered. The first suspicion of the danger that he had had was when he heard the " click ” of the lock as tho girl drew back th hammer.
A long, convulsive breath came from between the ruffian's Ups. Bold, desperate man that he was, he dreaded to die I'ke a rat in a trap by the hand of a woman.	|
“ Give me your word never to attempt to molest me^or else pray to Heaven to have mercy upon your soull" the girt l^id. In a low, determined voice.
“ You won’t dare to fire?” Ozark muttered.
•*.<s Heaven Is my judge, I will I” the girl replied. “ If you do not give me the promise, or If you attempt to move, I will kill you With as little mercy aa I would a wild beast.’* “ An’ you would trust my word not to worry yef”
»• Ye*."
“ All rightl It’s a bargain, th<jn," Ozark cried, abruptly. “ I ain’t afeard of death, but Til be durned ef I’d like to wiped out by you. Paddle ahead with your nigs; may-1 be skinned by wild-cats ef I tech yel"
And then the outlaw turned abruptly around and plunged through the door Into the darkness, while llercie, (aves ->j bar owu brave act, fell In a dead faint to the floor.
CHAPTER XXIII.
HOMEWARD.
K It's all settlod up, Judge," Howard said, as he entered the little office which the old lawyer had taken possession of so unceremoniously. - -
The overseer, Texas fallowed Howard into the apartment “ It’s all right, then?” General Smith exclaimed, rubbing his hands together gleefully.
“ Yes; the points you made, Judge, wen too much tot Toxtrroft, and he was glnd to get the *hanee to eomvomlw tbe matter," Howard answered.
" And did he accept it all aa law and goaDolf* T«U ask—W a bland smile upon nis fa» far*
’>»« W%D, it was a little hard for him to swallow; but I as-cored him that you knew the law, and that it would re-“ quire a trial even if year points were not tenable,” Howard replied.
“ He’s a bigger fool then than I thought he was,” Tell re-' marked; “ after! bad started Johnson orer with the papers, I was a lestle afraid I had put it too strong; and jet he never smoked It, ehr and then the Judge laid back in his chair, mnd indulged in a series of short, dry chuckles indicative of extraordinary mirth.
** I don’t see how in thunder you kept your face k> wen In the court-room,” Howard observed in a tone of wonder. ■" I come nearsnortlng two or three times, right out!”
The General and Texas had listened in astonishment to the words of the two laWyers; and then, after Howard finished his observation, seeing him sit down'lit s chair and laugh un-tll theitSis came into his eyes, the truth instantly flashed •cross the minds of both the lookers on.
Smith got up from his chair in extreme excitement
“ Tou don’t mean to say that the outrageous conduct of both of you In the court-room was aU a hoax on Foxcroft 1” the General exclaimed.
“ A hoax!” and the old judge straightened up and put on • solemn look. ' “ General Smith, what do you take me for?” and then Tell shook his forefinger slowly at the wd aoldier. 44 No, sdrt To-day you witnessed a • specimen brick ’ of how we used to administer Justice in Arkansas in. the olden time. Ur. Foxcroft is a stranger; we but followed the scriptural Injunction when we ' took him In.’ Doubtless in his far-off northern or eastern home he has often heard stories of how we conduct our courts of justice in this benighted region; we men who are innocent of shirt-collara, and who don't take much stock in store-clothes. When he was called upon to assume the seat of Justice, he naturally expected to see what he had heard about, and I really flatter myself that Bob, and your humble servant, succeeded in making a decided impression upon this ‘ looker-on in Venice.’ After he lias * spoiled the Egyptians ’ and goes back to his ‘ native heath,' he’ll be able to tell a pretty good story of how we run the law-courts down in this region.”
And then, as Smith thought over the scene in the court* room, and realized that it was all a stupendous joke, coolly jplumed and cleverly executed by the old fat lawyer, assisted by his younger legal brother, he could not restrain his laughter.
“ I swear, Judge!” Smith exclaimed, after he got through laughing, “ this is the richest joke I ever heard of. It’s too good to keep!”
“ Ah, no,” the Judge replied, solemnly. “ Your ’fingers om your lips I pray.’ It will never do to let il out; the worthy Justice would never hear the last of it; but, General Smith, I consider, sir, that you have ill-used me to-day.”
This abrupt accusation considerably astonished the plan* ter.
" What have I done now?”
" It Is not the sin of commission, General Smith, that you have to answer for, but the contrary,” the Judge explained with dignity, shaking the awful forefinger at Smith as he spoke. “ It Is a well-known fact, sir, for forty miles around, that Jim Tates, over opposite, at the General Lee saloon, keeps as. good whisky as- can be got in the State of Arkansas, and you- have never said ' fire-water ’ to me once, to day, sir.”
“ Come on, then, you old humbug!" cried Smith, advancing to the door; “ come, gentlemen, join us.” He addressed Howard and Texas.
“Send for Johnsonl” -eried Yell, as the party emerged into the street “ My conscience would upbraid me if we drank without our worthy sheriff.”
And so the party waited until “ Mister Johnson,” ss the Judge persisted In calling Mm, was hunted up.
The convivial ceremonies over, the Judge, Smith, and Texas, mounted their horses, rode down to the post-office, received their mail, and then departed homeward.
J-idge Yell bid them good night when he arrived at his ^laoe, and the General and his overseer continued on their way.-	■" ■ .'■■■ , •/- f.- .
Naturally they fell into conversation in. regard to the trial. Texas expressed his surprise -at the enormous fine that th* Justice had wished to inflict upon him.
“ Yell explained all about that,” the General said. “ You '«• Foxcroft is anxious to get the goodwill of the negroet, •nd naturally the blacks would be inclined to look upon this aCalr ss c wrt of an 'ootrags upon them, not knowing all
the details of the case. If Foxaoft isn't careful, thougSj he'll get into trouble. There was no cause for infilCtiifl heavy fine in this affair. If he had simply fined you M dollars, why of conne it would have been paid in a mom®| bat he overshot the mark and gave the Judge * chance ta get back at him. L Swear, though, I never dreamed flul the whole thing in the cottrt-room was a Joke, though I da think that both Howard and the Judge were acting likal couple of lunatics.”
Texas said very Uttle as they rode on, and the Groew did all the talking. He was in high spirits at the way thing* had gone, and he expressed his opinion that there weuldiq be much more trouble with tks hands.
The overseer was strangely moody, and seemed absorb* In his own thoughts, merely assenting to the General’s ifg marks.
Aa the two rode up to the house, they deteo*ed the fluttd of a white dress on the plazzs; and as they reined In thsfc horses, Missouri camn down tho steps.
“ Wh*t kept you so late, fattier?” she ssked; “ I've had supper for ever so long.”
“ Well do It justice now,’ Smith replied; “ we corns back conquering heroes.”
At the supper-table Smith relat«d what had transpired Is the court of Justice Foxcroft, a partial account of which 8u» had already given his mistress.
Smith had a hearty laugh aa he recited the extraordinary proceedings of old Judge Yell and Bob Howard, but the over; seer, although he smiled In sympathy with the General’s msft riment, did not seem to share his glev
Missouri, who had watched the overseer’s face closely, d*j tec ted an expression there which she had never seen before; It was evident to her that his mind was bent upon some suh ject not at all connected with the ’sault und battery case, and she shrewdly guessed that the subject we* not a pleasant one, whatever it might be.
After supper The-Man-from-Texas begfttd to be excused, and immediately retired.
Pretty Missouri frowned and bit her lip. It was plain that she did not like the proceeding.
The overseer pulled his hat down over hi* eyes as he d* acended the steps, and took his way to the sttvMe.
As he approached the building he heard the sounds at negro voices, and loud bursts of laughter from the interior.
Pausing for a moment on the threshold, he soon discovered that Sam was entertaining a select circle of friends with an imitation of the trial-scene before Justice Foxcroft, and just at that moment was delivering Judge Yell’s dosing speech, with such a laughable imitation of the Judge’s matt ner that it brought a smile to the lip* of Texas, nioodv *« h( was. But then he interrupted the exhibition by kT’^iai on the stable door, and calling upon Sam to come out In a moment the darkey made his appearance.
CHAPTER XXIV.
“ UJTING THE TRAIL.”
“ Br golly I is dat you, Massa Texas?” Bam exclaimed, at ho opened the door, and the light streaming out revealed taj face and form of the overseer.
“ Yes; come out; I want to speak to you.”
" Yes, sar,” and Sam advanced a step or twn.
“ Close the door; I want you to walk up the road | piece.”
“Yes, sar,” responded the negro, promptly; tfcsn ■ closed the door and followed the overseer.
“ Hadn’t you better go and get a hat?” Texas asked, Mtj tlcing that the black was-uncovered.
“ Is you gwine far?”	U
“ Oh, no, only up to the gate; I want to have a Uttl* taM with you about the hands,” the overseer answered.
“All right, den; s’pect I won’t catch de r’u’matis’; dll yer child tough,” Sam said, confidently.
The two walked slowly past the house and down fljj shady avenue, bordered by magnolia trees, witfct led to tN main road.	- *
“ Quite a number of the hands ars in the stable noiirjs suppose »” Texas asked.	Jfl
“ Yes. sar; de boys heerd las’ a bit ’bout dat ver trial (M
: fcow de ote ' Judge fetched dem, anVdey come np for to git ' me to ’spWn de matter to dere obfusticated interloms,” Sam •xptatoed, vritb a great deal of dignity risible in his manner.
" “ What do they think about the affair f"
“ By golly, dey say dai de ole Judge is mad for sure, an’ dat young Bob Howard ain’t much better, fur he’s gineruUy dat foil of whisky dat It wouldn’t do fur to hold a iighioi. match near his mouf, kaae he’d ’splode, sure’s yer bom.”
“ But what do they think of the way I handled King
“Itfow, Massa Texaa, I Jes' tefl yer w’at it is!" Sam exclaimed, emphatically, " dar ain’t a nig on dis yer plantation dat would dar* to wink crossways at ye now. Dat Congo ’e Jes’ de worst man you eber see’d. He’s Jes’ bin walkin’ right ober de darkles round heah eber since he come.”
“ You think, then, that we will not hare any trouble with <he hands?” Texas asked, thoughtfully.
“ Not a mite, Massa Texas I” Sam exclaimed, in a very decided manner; *' day’s all willin’ to work, ef dem bad niggers will only keep away an' luff ’em alone. Dey’a got to live Jes’ like a white man, an' ef dey don’t work, .whar is dey gwine to git dar victuiums? an' dat’s w'at’s de matter wid Hannah.”
“ The hands generally are perfectly willing to work, I •appose, if such fellows as this Congo leave them alone?” “By golly, Massa Texas, you kin Jes’ bet all de ha’r on de back of your head on dat I” Sam replied, emphatically. “ It’s Jes’ such mean brack niggers aa dis yer Congo dat makes sU de fuss; I ’clar* to goodness, I done t’lnk you smash him ribs In when you hit dat belly-whopper dat time. By golly! he looked as ef he ^ad bln sent fur an’ couldn’t comet"
The ovsreeer laughed at the expression.
“Who vere those fellows that Congo bad along with Mm?"
“ Dem dar’iles dat lie so in de court?”
"Yes.”
" I don't -van’ fur to say nuffln ag’in’ nobody," Bam said, cautiously, " but, ef I was a chicken an’ saw dem nigs cornin’ in de night, Td Jes’ roost mighty high.”
" Don’t work much, I suppose?”
«De hardest work dey eber do is huntin’ ’coons in de swamp,” Sam replied, disdainfully. “Dem’s poor trash; «in’t fit fur nuffln but to drink whisky, an’ sleep in de sun wid dere moufs open for to ketch flies.”
“ Yea, but this old fellow that they call Uncle Snow, la he one of that class, loo?” Texas asked, carelessly.
“ Oh, no, sar; he’s a gemmen, he Is. He’a Jes’ one of de best ole diggers dat dere Is in dis yer country. Why, he ■was raised on dis yer place wid de Gineral.”
'' He was?”
“ Yes, sar; ’fore de war he was de Glneral’s own man, but when de Gineral was off wid de sodjers, arter de Linkun Y ankees come, de ole Uncle started a store fur to sell to de sodjers; you see, dere was ’bout a hundred Yankees down to de landing.”
"And did the old man make out pretty well?” Texas asked, in a careless sort of way.
“Yes, sar; he done fust-rate, an’ he’s got a mighty nice little store now in his ole shanty; he doea a heap of business dere.” ‘
‘ ‘ Where Is the old man’s store?”
Texas asked the question more with the air of a man who was merely talking because he had nothing better to do than from any real Interest in the.subject
“ You knows whar de Judge’s place Is; an’ ef you noticed dat Jes’ afore yon get to de furst house de odder side of de Judge’s place dat dere is a small road turns off to de right” “Yes, I think I noticed it," the overseer said, thoughtfully; “ there’s a small whitewashed shanty on the left, facing the road, Isn’t there?”
“ Yes, sar,” Sam replied, promptly. “ Wen, when you get lo dat road you turn off to de right han’, as ef you was a-gwtne to Fort Smith, an’ de furst house you come to is ok Uncle Snow’s.”
Then the overseer turned abruptly round and commenced so Walk back to the hodse; Sam followed his example.
“ You think that there will be no trouble with toe hands?” Texaa said, returning to the fonhe-, subject again.
' “No, sar; wue &s yer bom!” rejnled the negro, decidedly; 4* dere won't any more mean brack trash come fo< lin* round dis yer’plantation-arter de way you wolloned Congo; but Jos' you look out, Massa-Texas, dat dat mean nig don’t hide lu a fence-comer wid a shot-gun fur yer some time; he’d jss' as mo sheet a man as sat a roasted ’posaUm."
*'ID keep my eyes open for him," Texas replied, to Ms pool, careless way. “If be ever levels rvir«*pdu«t ms, TO give him a chance to get measured for a coffin before ha caa pull the trigger.”	■ " > »** ••'■T -*
■ “ Hi-yah!” chuckled Sam; “ I’d walk tea mffs* for to sea dat nigger planted, 'deed I would!" : ' ■°,'i 'f‘,
The two walked on in silence until they reached fht hShaa.
With his foot on the steps, Texas spoke:
“ We’H take field bright and early to-morrow; we must make up-for the time lost to-day."
“ Yes, sar; de nigs are willin’ fur to do all dey kin ef dey ain’t ’sturbed by scallywag!nms like dat Congo," Sam tepHed, as he departed for the stable.
The overseer proceeded np-stalrs directly to his room, drew a match on the sole of his boot and lit a candle which stood upon the mantelpiece.
The face of the overseer was dark and gloomy, and there was a restless,'fitful light in his eyes:
He opened the top drawer of; the Utile bureau, which stood between the two windows, and from the drawer took the leather belt which swung the two holsters into which the revolvers were thrust	—mini it,-m:
Texas drew the' revolvers from the holsters, and, by the light of the candle, inspected tha charges. Fully satisfied that they were in perfect order, he returned them to their places and buckled the belt around his waist Then from the draws-, he took the keen-edged bowie-knife and thrust it through the belt And after this was done, he extinguished tha candle, and quietly doling the door behind him, stole with noiseless steps down the stairs.
With equal caution he opened the front door of the house and closed it behind him, after he had passed through tha portal.	- i. )• i»re
The sounds of laughter and of merriment still came from the negroes in the stable.	■'■„•( >-v I '
Texas hesitated and listened for a moment; then descending the steps, he walked cautiously down the avenue toward the road.
He fancied that he was unobserved, but his thought waa wrong, for Missouri, sitting by one of the windows ef hot bedchamber, which overlooked the approach to the houae, detected the figure of the overseer skulking, like a thief to the night, into the dense shadows cast by the magnolia trees. '
CHAPTER XXV.
OLE UKCLB SNOW.
With cautious steps the overseer proceeded until he came to the main road; then he cast a single glance back at tha house as if to reassure himself that his departure had not been noticed by any one. Feeling fully satisfied that he was unobserved, he proceeded with rapid steps down the road toward SmithvUle.
It was one of the balmy spring nights so common to Arkansas. The dark-blue sky above waa studded with a count less myriad of twinkling stars—spangledover with the jewels of the night The moon had not yet risen, but afar off os the line of the eastern horizon appeared the faint glow of light which heralded the coming of the bride of darkness. The insects of the night piped their shrill tones from earth, grass, bush and tree, and aU the air was filled with a sweet, subtle perfume coming from the opening spring blossoms.
But the overseer heeded not the glorious sky above, the notes of the night Insects, nor the sweet incense of Nature’s children. Once he had paused and cast a glance up at the be-diamonded heavens above, not to look and vonder at the flashing lamps of the firmament, bat to note ho-v soon the moon would rise, and then again he had halted for a second in his rapid onward stride when the distant howls of the. watchdogs broke upon the stillness of the night, u cur answered cur in fierce and vaporous yowL
Onward with vigorous strides he went, the fierce passion of the chase swelling In his heart, and what scent so hot to our nostrils as 'when we track the human quarry?
Judge Yell’s place he passed and came to where the narrow road turned off to the right	v-lWj Twenty paces up the road, heading to .the west, and the overseer paused to front of a small two^tory shanty, the whitewashed walls of which glared out oa the gloom of the night.
Through tbs crack* of the door and the tightly-shuttered windows came the flickering rays of a light,»howing that ||m inmates of the shanty had not yet retired to rest
The overseer stepped up to the door and knocked.
There was s moment of silence, then came the sound of SOine one moving within the shanty and then steps approached the door hut no one ipoke. The overseer guessed at once that the inmate was listening as If to assure himself that his ears had not deceived him, 10 Texas raised his‘land and thumped on the door again.
“ Who’s darr questioned a roles from within, and from the voice the orerseer recognised at once that it was the old •ncle lu person who spoke.
“ Mr. Texas, General Smith’s orerseer."
“ An’ does you want fur to see me?” the old negro asked.
.** Xs% Prs :got some reiy important business with you-, opes the; door."
“Is you all alone!"
. k “ Yes,” Texas replied, wondering at the old man’s caution.
Then he heard the noise made. by the negro in removing the? stout bar which fastened the door, and after that the doer . .opened and the old, white-headed darky peered out cautiously r ^V Tors ds Lord, dat is you for sure, Massa Texasl”'the dd negro exclaimed, throwing open the door widely so that the orerseer could enter; an inritation which he Immediately proceeded to accept
, .The interior of the shanty consisted of one room only. On the right hand was a small counter, and around.the sides - of the room were shelves filled with a miscellaneous'stock of groceries and drygoods.
A tallow candle burned on the counter, and near by was t cane-seat arm-chair which the old negro eridently had been •-ecupying when he had been aroused by the knock at the loot.
At one end of the room was a ladder which led to the second story.
“Did you hare any doubt ss to whether it was me or not!" the orerseer asked, ss the old man closed the door again and proceeded to put up the bar.
“ Yes, sar,” the old uncle answered, promptly; “ dere’s a heap of mean white folks—an’ brack trash too fur dat matter—a-prowlin’ round arter dark. You can’t be too keerful, Massa Texas. Dey fink dat de ole man’s got a little money ’kase I keeps dis yere store, an’ I done fink dat dey will trouble me sometime. I fought I knew yer roice, but I wasn’t gwine to left you ln afore I know’d fur sure.”
“ Is there anybody besides ourselves In the house!” Texas asked, glancing around, and his eyes resting upon the rude ladder leading to the upper story.
“ Yes, sar; dere’s my gran’son up dar,” the old negro replied. “ I ’spect he’s sound asleep dough; dat chile kin sleep like a yaller dog in de sun.”
“ You had better find out if he is asleep, for I hare some* thing reiy particular to say to you, and I don’t wish any one to hear it besides ourselves.” Texas spoke with evident earnestness.
Tbe old negro looked astonished. He couldn't imagine what could be the nature of the communication.
* I done see, sar," he replied. “ Ephraim, you Ephraim!” he called, going to the foot of the ladder; but there was no answer from the occupant of the room above. “I dons fink he's sound as & ’coon In a hollow treo, Massa Te±»o.” the old negro said, in a tone of conviction. “ I'll Jes’ take a look up dar an’ see dough, fur *tire.”.
Tbe old msn climbed up the ladder, and as his head em erged through a hole in the floor abore, the heavy breatning of the young negro, who was stretched out, wrapped ln a buffalo robe, in the further corner of the upper room, con rinced him that the boy was sound ssleepi
The negro descended the ladder again.
“ Is he asleep!" Texas asked.
“ Jes' like a log, sar; fore de Lord, he Isn’t gwine to done wake out of dat sleep afore de morain’,” the old negro answered.
“ Then he will not be like to overhear our conversation!*
“ No, sar."
“ Sit down, uncle, for I reckon we’re got quite a talk before us,” Texas said, helping himself to the arm-chair by the oounter while the old negro sat down on a keg near by, an expression cf wonder on his fkce.
“ Now, uncle, we want to go a good ways baA—’way back to the first of the war,” Texas began.
“ Yes, sar; but dis yere ole nigger Is jes’ stumped as to wfe job’s gwine to say,” the sged black remarked, is wonder.
"You will understand pretty soon; but, in the ftrst plaoa, before I commence, I want you to promise'to keep what I am going to say a profound secret You mustn’t say a word about the matter to any one. WM you promise that!"
Tbe old darky thought ths matter over for a few minutes in silence.
“ See hyer, Massa Texas,” he said, at length, “you Wt gwine to git me inter any trouble, is you!"
“ Oh, no; no fear cf that”
“ Well.-Uita, its long as you Isn’t gwine to ax me fur to hurt nobody or nuffln’ I’ll 'gree fur to keep my mouf shet”
“ That is aU I ask," the oveisoer rejoined; then he remain*) silent-for a few minutes, eridently deliberating how to begin, while the old negro watched him with an expression of wonder risible on his wrinkled, drled up features.
“ You remember when (he war commenced, ln slxty-cne!” “Yes, sar,” the Old Uncle replied, promptly; "I wai ilr tap on Gincral Smith's place, den; dar*a whar I was raised De Glneral was kurnel of de fust r^gim^nt dat was got up ’round hyer. I ’spectpd dat de Glneral would want me fur to go ’long when de rigiment marched-fur Missouri wld Massa Glneral Price, but de ole massa fought dat I was too ole fui to go wfd de' sodgers an’ luff me behind."
“ Dp you remember about two years after that time, ln ths spring of sixty-three, when s regiment of Texse troops were quartered down at the landing!”
“ Yes, sar,’’ tbe old negro replied; “ dey was rigular gamecocks, dey was; dey had more fightin’ an’gamblin' an1 whisky drinkin’ in dat air rigiment dan any odder rigiment dat I ebez see’d. De ossifers of dat ’ere rigiment used fur to rid* frough de town jes’ b’llln’ drunk,”
“ And just about that time quite a number of strange blacks came into the landing, a great many came with this same Texas regiment!"
“ Yes, sar; 'fore do Lord, dere was a heap of scallywag* wld dat rigiment!’’
“ Did you ever happen to meet at that time with a light colored yellow fellow named Jupiter!’’
Old Uncle Snow started In amazement, and an exp esaior of profound wonder came over his sable face.
CHAPTER XXVI.
THB YELLOW BOT, JTJPK.
Ths eyes of tbe overseer sparkled as he noticed the expression upon the face of the negro. He felt sure that he was upon the right scent, after all.
Old Uncle Snow looked down at the floor; then he stared up at the ceiling; and, finally, he cast a cautious glance at the face of the overseer, but the calm expression he saw there did not aid him In the least to guess why Francis Texas-should inquire concerning a vagabond freed man.
“ Why does you want to know!” the old negro asked, cautiously, and with a look of Intense curiosity upon his dried-up features.
The overseer laughed.
“ What the deuce has that got to do with it!" he questioned. “ I simply asked you, old man, if you knew the boy. What do you care what I want with him!”
“ Of course it’s no bus’ness of mine, sar; I know that fur sure. You see, I only axed kase you kinder flustrated me. 'Fore de Lord, how could' I tell dat you know’d any ting 'bout Jupe!" the negro replied, evasively.
“ You knew a yellow fellow called Jupiter, then!"
“Yes, sar."
“ Have you any idea where he is now!"
“ No, sar; I ain't set my eyes on him since he done leavi dis yere place, in eighteen-sixty-four,” Uncle Bnow answereu, rery quickly.
“ What sort of a boy was this Jupe!”
“ He was a right smart, good boy, sar."
“Were you pretty intimate with turn wnen ne wm around here!” Texas asked, in quite sn Indifferent sort of way, but as he put the question, he watched the faoe of ths old negro intently.
“ Yes, sar, I knowed him pretty welL"
“ I met Jupiter down in Texas and he told me that he had some right good friends up this way. He spoke particularly about some good old auAty who nursed him through a Ion, attack of the swamp-fever that, kept him on his fsr • long time."
•• Wat’s dstr exclaimed tbs old negro, in astonishment; ole aunty name him t’rougb a fever f By golly! dat -was r$e; yes, sari”
It was. you?" tbe overseer said, apparently astonished.
*' Yea, sar, dis yere ole nigger I" replied Dncle Bnovr, emphatically; “ dere wa’n't a she-womon round dat boy from :de furst to de las'. I nussed him from de time dat I diaklv-tred him flat oa his back, out in de cabin by de nramp, till be went away from dis yere place, down de riber in da Des Arc."
41 Come to think of it, I believe Jupiter did tell me that it was a man that helped^ him along," the overseer remarked.
“ Yes, sar; it was me, sure ss you’re bom!" Uecle Snow persisted.	^	*
. »« Of course you don’t know that Jupiter is dead?” Texas
“ Dead!” exclaimed the old man, ln wonder; " is dat soP
•' Yes; be walked off a steamer one night In tbe dark, a.tning up the Mississippi, and the current swept him down. The body even was never recovered."
•• Poor nigger," Uncle Snow observed, with a shake of bis bead.
Yes; he gave just one cry when be struck the water, and then '“le current tracked him under. That was only about two weeks ago. He and I were coming up the river together, bound for this place.”
The old negro looked a little astonished at this intelligence. He couldn’t understand what possible interest there could be in common between the freedman, Jupiter, and the red-coated overseer.
“ And poor Jupiter drowned fur sure?” the negro mur-mured, in a melancholy tone.
“ Yes; and now, Unde Snow, I've come after that package Jupiter left in your care,” Texas said, In an off-hand way-	„
The negro gave Just a little bit of a start, but be did not seem bo much astonished as be had been at first.
“ A package dat Jupe left with met” the .old fellow inquired.
1 " Yes; if you have any doubts, just look at this ring,” the everwer said, and be took a small seal ring of chased gold from bis wallet and gave it into the hands of Uncle Snow.
The old negro looked at it carefully. From tbe expression upon bis feature* it was plainly evident that be had seen it before.
•* Do y in rpcognize itf" Texas asked.
“ Tes, lar."
" And you will surrender the package to me that he left with you for safe keeping?”-
' “ 'Fore de Lord, be didn’t leave any package wid me, sar,” the old negro replied, earnestly.
The overseer laughed; be understood tbe subterfuge.
“ Uncle Snow, have you any objection to tell me how y* became Acquainted with Jupiterf” Texas asked.
Tbe old darky cocked his head on one side after tbe issh-Ion of a deliberating ben and looked at the overseer for a moment with an expression of profound wisdom plainly visible upon hi' wrinkled features. He was apparently meditating whether be would compromise himself in any way by giving the Information that the overseer bad asked for.
E " Well, I dunno," he said, slowly; “I don’t see as it will hurt miffin' ef I tole you 1>out de ’bole t’ing."
“ I don't see myself how it will possibly barm any one, Uncle, if you open your potato-trap and spit It out,” Texas said, smilingly “ Jupiter’s dead; so It can’t damage him.”
"No, sar, an' I don’t 'spect dat it would hurt him a mite *f he wasn’t,” the old darky said, sagely. “ But you see, wr, your cornin' in dis yere promlsc’us way an' 'qulrin’ T>out £<at yaller boy has so kinder obfusticated me dat I ’dare to "«an I'se completely conglomerated.”
< "Go ahead and tell me what you know about the boy, and thro Til explain to youwhyl inquire and the mean* by which i have been constituted heir to the package that Jupiter left
this town.”
“Yes, sar,” tho negro said, absently; his mind was evi-; fatly in a fog. Tbe easy assurance of the overseer per-plextd him.
You first met Jupe in sixty-three, I believe?"
"Yea, gar, it was when dat yere Texas rigiment was hyer. ■;.t had Jea’ got permission from de Gineral fur to open dis yere Man. I kin remember jee’ as well as kin be, it wis de very .\aigbt dat dat Tens rigiment left de landin' fur to go an' fight dat Yankes\Glncrd Steeledatwaa advancin' fur to gobble up •>I*ttI* Rock, aa’ for* de Lord, h* did, too, In spite of 'em.
Wen, sar, dat very night I was a-comin' cm over Mulbwrj crick road—you see, I’d been back ln de country, fur to buy some eggs an’ chickens an’ a lot of odder truck; an’ dere ws* a bright moon dat night, an’ jes’ as 1 come dong de road, ’bout three miles out, where de swash from Black-Jack Swamp run clos' up to de road, I heered de awfullest groans dat I ebber did heer. At fust I was de most scared nigger da* ebber was seen, but den I listen jes’ a little an’ 11oun' oeT dat de noise came from a little de cabin back from de road right by de swamp; an’ den, putty soon, I see'd dat it wasn’ any t’ing bad, ody some poor critter dat waa hurt mighty ewfd. So I went ober to de cabin, aa’ dere I foun' Jupiter a-lyin' flat on his back wid de wust fever dat you ebbei did see. I fixed him up as wen as I could, an' he tole me ell about himself. He was de servant of one of dem Texas ossi-fers, an’ be had bln beat jea’ as ef he had bin a dog, an’ he’d run away, knowln’ dat de rigiment waa gwine to move afore long, an’ dat dey wouldn't be able fur to hunt fur him much. Be bad bin lyin' In de swamp for two nlghta an’ de fever go* hold of him. You see, he was one of dem nlggeri from paai de Mexikln line, whar dey don’t have much fever. He hadn’t suffer’ much till arter sundown, an’ den de ole fever jee’ laid him right out I s’pect he would have bln a dead nigg* 'fore long ef I hadn’t come dong jee' den, like de good Bam-aritan dat you read *bout In de Scriptur’s. I happen to have a little whisky dat pine burrs bad bln steeped In, de best t'lng in de world fur to break de fever, an’ wid dat I fotch him dong. Arter he got well, an’ de Yankee* gobbled up Little Rock, he went down dere an' I nebber see’d any t’ing more of him."
CHAPTER XXVII.
TUX TIN TOBACCO-BOX.
“ Akd that is all that you know about Juyiterf Texas sdd, after tbe negro bad finished his story.
<■ Tes, sar.” As the old negro spoke he cast a shrewd glance Into the face of the overseer, as if with intent to discover there whether his words were believed or not The face of Texas was as cdm and qdet as usual. Whatevw his thoughts might be, they were not to be reed in his features.
“ And now, Uncle, I will relate Jo you certain details which you have skipped in your narrative, ” Texas sdd.
The old negro looked a little astonished at this, but contented himself with putting on a look of wonder and he'd his peace. > ^ ;
•• After the Texaa regiment departed, and Jupiter recovered his senses a little, thinking that he was never going to get well and must shortly die, he Intrusted a secret to you; did he not?” and aa the overseer put the question, he fixed hi. keen eyes fdl on thr-face of the negro.
Uncle Snow was staggered; he did not attempt to deny the fact
“ Tore de Lord, you must be a witch!” he exclaimed.
“ Oh, no; not a bit of witchcraft about the matter st an,” the overseer replied. “ Jupiter told me all about It- lam ody repeating the story to you so that you will have no doubt in regard to my right to demand the package from you, left by the yd'ow boy.”
“ Yes, sar,” the. old negro sdd, mechanically. He did not attempt to deny the existence of the package now.
“ Now I will repeat what Jupiter sdd to you. In tbs first place, he made you swear that you wodd never raved what he was going to tell you except ss he should dictate. That’s right, isn’t itf”
“ Yes, sar,” Uncle Snow answered, aa expression ef solemnity gathering upon his sable face.
“ Then he proceeded to tell you that, passing through ths swamp just at sundown, coming back from the blrd-limpa that he had set, to the ruinied cabin where he had taken up his quarters, he came upon wbat was apparently the deed body of a man. Upon kneeling down by his ride be discovered that he had been shpt through ths breast and was not yet dead, but dying. The man was white and of middle age. He told Jupiter that be had been murdered, and wished him to carry a message to a certain party who might avenge his death. Ho gave Jupiter his watch and chain, this «eal ring and a hundred dollars in money, all he. had, OS condition mat he would carry,a tin tobacco-box and *' carta in something, that the bd* contained, to * man la Texaa, assuring Jupiter that, upon delivering the box, bs would i» ' ceixe a hundred dollars mote.”
"He nebber tole me a *©rd-’6out dit, sar," the old negro 'said, quickly, “ he nebber said dat he was gwine to git • otn fur guvin' ds box up.”
1 “Thatwas the bargain, though," Texas replied. “The murdered rn*n h"d hardly managed to teil his wishes before he commenced to stiffen in death. Jupiter took the watch and chain, the seal-ring, the money and the tobacco-box; then be scooped a hole ln, the swamp and buried the body.”
“ Dat’s all correct, sar; true aa de Gospel I” exclaimed the aegro, earnestly.
“ A little while after he told the story to you the fever broke and he commenced to get well Then, as soon as the river was cleared.of the rebel batteries, and the boats commenced to run between Little Rock and the Mississippi, he started on his search for the person in Texas to whom he was to deliver the message left by the dead man. But he did not dare to take the box with him for fear that he might lose It on the way; so he left it with you.”
•• No, sari” exclaimed the old darky, quickly; “he didn’t guv U to me. Tore de Lord, I sw’sr he nebber guy it to
me”	.*
A smile curled the Up of the overseer as he cast a shrewd, keen glance at the face of the negro. He detected the evident evasion, and was not thus easily to be thrown off the track or baffled in his purpose.
" He did not give it to you, but he told you where he had concealed the box!”
The old negro stared at the overseer with open mouth. The wily " Man-from-Texas" had guessed the truth and the old Uncle could not gainsay it.
" You see, I understand all about it,” the overseer continued, in a lone of confidence. “ It Is of no use to attempt to deceive me about the matter. The box belongs to me. I am the person in Texas that Jupiter went after.”
"But whar has you bin aU dis yere time?" the negro asked, astonished.
“ A very natural question and one easily explained,-” Texas replied.' “Jupiter got to New Orleans In sixty-four, aU right, but he found that if he attempted to get into Texas, then held by the Confederates, in aU probability before he had gone to rods some one would have seized him for an •scaped slave. So he walled in New Orleans until the end v>f the w*r, and even then he did not dare to venture into the State until the fsU and did not arrive at San Antonio— where he	to find me—until the spring of sixty-six,
ss his money gave out by the time he got to Galveston and he Iml been compelled to work his way along, The watch and he had been obliged to pawn In New Orleans, and only the seal-ring remained as proof of Us statements. When Jupiter finally reached San Antonio, I had Just departed for Mexico on business and did not return for a year and a so that It was weU into sixty-seven before Jupiter and I met. Then I had to settle up some business in San Antonio—a law-euit which I had to attend to in person— and it ins weU Into this spring before Jupiter and myself started for this place. As I told you before, Jupiter was drowned coming up the river, and so I nearly lost all clue to the box, for the yeUow boy always manifested a strange reluctance to teU me your name; possibly he was afraid that I might wish to get the box myself from you and so. defraud him of the one hundred dollars that he wss to receive from me when he placed the package in my hands. He always described you. as an old white-haired Uncle, who kept a Uttle store on the outskirts of the village. When I saw you In the court-room, to-day, I had a suspicion that you were the man I was in search of. Now, to convince you that every diing is fair and above-board, I’ll make this offer: take me . to the place where the box is concealed, open it In my presence, and If from the contents I cannot prove that I am the Mmn that ought to have it, you may keep the box and what in contains yourself. And furthermore: if I prove to your satisfaction that I am the man entitled to the box, you shaU have the hundred dollars that were promised to Jupiter.” The eyes of the old darky sparkled. It was an easy way to make so large a sum.
" I reckon dat yon is de man, Massa Texas,” be said. •• I done fink dat I ought fur to gib you dat box. It’s jesf •towed away like a squirrel bide* bis nuts fur de winter; yea, tar. lt is bid in dat same ole Shanty oat la de swamp whar Jupiter used for to Ub."
“Toil have to pass right by General Bm.*th's place to •bike the Kutteaj eraex road, doat you?" tbs oversow •eked. '
"YmLw."
“ Wffl you meet me where the road tuna off to go «p’M the house, say just» Uttle before daybreak to-morrow mam.
ing?”
41 Yes, sar, TO be dary" the old negro responded, promptly. “ It’s only *bout a mile back of Ml— Glnsra) Smith’s plantation.”
» You'll find me waiting for you.”
The overseer rose; Uncle Snow pot down the bar of tb» door, and Texas, bidding him “ good-night,” walked off la the darkness.
The old darky proceeded up-stairs to bed, considerably astonished in his mind.
As Uncle Snow and the candle emerged into the loft, Jim Crow woke up, with a prolonged yawn.
“ Wot’s de time, gran’fader?" he asked.
“ I s’pect It’s arter ten, chile."
“By golly!” cried Jim Crow, jumping up. “I promised to be down at Uncle Ned’s plsce to go arter ’coon at tec. I’se offl”
And the lively young nigger departed la spite of his gran’fader’s remonstrances.
CHAPTER XXVUl.
TH* LKAQUB OT FOUB
Black-Jack Swamp by night again, and a moody group of four holding a oouncil -by the flickering Ught of the fire, burning In the center of,the rude cabin of the outlaw.
YeU Ooark was stretched at full length upon one of - ths bear-sklns, bis hands clasped behind his head.
Fayette and Foxcroft were seated close to the fire on » section of a cottonwood, covered by a ski*, foiming a rude sort of bench.
King Congo, his face still covered by the bandages, was, liks Ozark, extended at full length In a corner on a bear-akin, his feet to the fire, and reclining on his elbow.
The discussion that had been going on had apparently sot been particularly pleasant in its nature.
Foxcroft had just finished relating the Incidents of the trial before him that day, and he had been Interrupted hall a dozen times by sarcastic remarks from Fayette sad the outlaw, and the Justice finally lost patience.
“ Oh, it’s aU very easy to talk, now that the a&ir |» over!” he exclaimed, angrily. “ It is easy now to ask why didn’t I do this and why didn't I do that. I did the best 1 know how. I teU you, Mr. Fayette, with aU your shrewdness and tact, you wouldn’t care much to tackle old Judge YeU!”
“ Why. Foxcroft!” exclaimed Fayette, impatiently, “ can’t yon see that you’ve been made a fool of?”
" No, I can’t!” replied Foxcroft, indignantly. “ It was no joking matter the way the old Judge went for me, and yoo have knowledge enough of the law, Mr. Fayette, to know that an able lawyer can worry a man like blazes, even if he hasn't got a shadow of right on his side!"
“Why, the whole thing was a perfect farcer exclaimed Fayette, abruptly. “ TO bet a thousand dollars that It was a made-up joke between Bob Howard and old Judge YelL The idea of their having a fight in open ciurt; why, it’s ridiculous!”
“WeU, it may seem ridiculous, but, hang me if ft didn’t take place,” Foxcroft returned, stubbornly. '' Congo was there; he saw it. I’U leave it to him! Congo didn't Bob Howard and the Judge clinch so that it took half a dozen to separate them?”
“Me see ’urn!” growled the block, who stlU felt terribly •ore from the effects of the sledge-hammer-like blows of the Man-from-Texas.
“ Oh, I tell you it was aH made up between the two I" Fayette again cried, in Impatience. “ They didn’t hurt eaci other, did they?”
“ Wen, I confess that I don’t think that either of the tw» were marked at aU," Foxcroft replied, •• but, you see, we pulled them apart before they got a chance to damage each other any; but Johnson, the sheriff, has got marks; hit's got two of the most beautiful black eyes that you ever saw."
There was a tone of triumph in Foxcroft’a voice as he mad* this statement He knew that there was BO disputing tbs truth of that.
“ It's a mighty strange affair, taka It altogether,” Wftta
ft&tiWT. and then he turned to Congo. " And how waa it kJ regard to youand this overseer?” he vked. “ I thought l&ui you were a fighting man? From what I've heard, it Em to me that this fellow handled you as if you had been KWg bqy instead of a man.”
p; The negro gave utterance to a growl of rage. The pain ijgt hla bruises seemed to iedoj»ble-when he thought of the tn ceremonious way in which the overseer had battered him
f^“Me dunno," he said, sullenly; “ he no stan’ stiU an’ luff ms ’um.. When me strike he jump back fore me pot ban’s up, an’ smash me in de face two, free times, aH togedder. Me dunno how to do it; he so quick, me no mb. Me kin *0111 some time, dough 1” And from the manner in which the negro hissed the words between his teeth, it wss perfectly apparent that he folly meant to execute his threat
Fayette’s lips curled ss he listened to the menace of the giant black. From the specimen that he had seen of the. drill of The-Mao-from-Tezas, he easily realized that the over^ 'ieer was perfectly competent to take care of himself, and that at the gams they were playing, the old adage was likely to be proven true, that " Jack was as good as his master.”
“ Well, that nicely contrived plan has gone to smash," Fayette said; “ so we must think of another. By the way, Osark,” and he turned abruptly io the outlaw, " how about the school teacher? Have you warned her to leave yet? I heard that Llestessnt Winnie was sees riding thrtragh the iffags to-night”
“I sailed on the gal an* Jls’ tole her that she would havs to git np an* git," Ozark answered.
Fayette detected a peculiar tone in the outlaw’s voice as M spoke, and % sudden suspicion flashed into his mind that, .WMslbty, Ozark had not succeeded any better in his plan than floogo and Foxcroft had in theirs.
: “ Weil, what did she say? I suppose that she was fright-teed out of her wits and promised to go at once, eh?” Fay-ttte asked, although he didn’t suppose any such thing.
“ Not by a dog-goned sightl” cried Ozark, abruptly. “ I reckon 1 hain’t got any. thing more to boast of than my partners over thar. I’ll teU you all about it Ton see, 1 iayed in the bush tffl this durned lieutenant lit out I knew that Bome one was inside with the gal, ’coe there was a hoes fastened to the fence, an’, nat’rally, I suspicioned that it was the sodjer. When be came out I had half a mind to try a crack at him, 'spite of what you said, but I was afeard of these pop-gun revolvers; they ain’t good fur much less ■you’re right alongside of a man, an’ I were a good fifty feet off. So I jes' lay quiet an’ let him ride off; then I walked |nto the houre jes’ aa if I was a-goin’ to eat the gal up, body aa’ boots; but she wa’n’t a mite skeered, an’ talked back to ;me as sarcy as yer please. Arter I had talked to her a While, an’ tried fur to akeer her a bit, like a fool, 1 shoved »y revolver back into my belt, an’ then the furst thing I knowed she had a pop-gun out from the drawer of the table an’ leveled at my breast She had me dead to rights, fur 'tare. Gentlemen, it's the only time in my life that I ever feh skeered; but, to have it go ’round through this hyer State that 1, Yell Ozark, the Arkansas outlaw, who has fit -the United States Government ever since the war, single-

:t: Ozark spoke very gravely; it waa evident that he was fully

“ Can’t you suggest some other plans??, aakod Foxcrpft, anxiously. ‘‘ I own for my part that I am Tati*® girl is to stay, although I wish that the lieutenant csalil be induced to get out"
“ Oh, she didn't offer to shoot; all she said that she wanted was for me to promise not to trouble her any j*fc»e," Orark replied. “ She had me, I tell yer! I saw •hoot in her eyes every time.

Ocabx burst out into a hearty laugh at Foxcroft's speech “ Hear the ole fat cuss I" he exclaimed. “TO bet a bale of cotton ag’in’ a coon's skin thet he’s bln ahlnnln’ up to the spunky leetle gal himself I”
“Well, what if. I have?” demanded Foxcroft, indignantly j “ i believe that that is my business and no on* elee’s, isn’t it? I didn’t make any objections when it was proposed to drive her away. I didn’t attempt to interfere against the general wish. I sacrificed my own feelings for the benefit of the rest—you, YeU Ozark, in particular.”
“ Oh, come now, Foxcroft, own up I” Fayette cried. “ You didn’t make any objections because you thought that the girl would come to you for sssistsnoe, and then yoa could do what you liked with her. Wasn’t that the reason, eh?"	.i,
“ Oh, he’s jes’ a sly old ooonl" exclaimed Ozark, with a loud laugh.
“ Gentlemen, If my motives are to be misunderstood in this way, I shall not take the trouble to attempt to change your opinions,” Foxcroft answered, with a great deal of dig nity, and with an attempt to pot on an air of injured lnno cence, which was not particularly successful, and which only made Fayette smile sarcastically, while Ozark laughed outright
“ But oome, we must to business, boys," said Fayette abruptly; “ we must try again.”
“ It vfll n.r.r do to give It np bo, KMs* BnmJ-Ozark chanted at the top at his voloe.
“ These two men, the overseer and Lieutenant Winnie, must be started out of'this county,” Fayette continued.
“ Let me lay for both on ’em with my double-barrel," suggested the swamp ruffian.
" I told you before that that plan wouldn’t work," exclaimed Fayette, impatiently, "It would bring such a hue and cry down upon us that it would make the county too hoi to hold na.”
" They’ve bin a-chasin’ me ever since the war, and they haln’t got me yttt” Ozark said, doggedly.
“ The pitcher that goes often to the well wfll be broken at last,” Fayette replied, coldly. “ We don’t want bravado just now, Ozark; we want a little good sound sense, first, for the lieutenant, I saw him last night when he rode through the town; he and Gol Adair were together, and I took occasion to have a little conversation with Adair, after the lieutenant left him. I commenced by stating that I had seen the lieutenant, and hinted to Gol that since Winnie was down here, it would be a good idea to make another attempt to capture you, Ozark; and to make shOrt work of • long conversation, I told Adair plainly thst I was sure he could lead a party to your hiding-place in the swamp, and offered him a hundred dollars to do the Job. Adair came right out flat-footed, and declared that he wouldn’t have any thing to do with It for fifty hundred; said h* had something better to do than to turn himself into ' a dog-goned bloodhound;’ and further added that the lieutenant hSd other fish to fry, just now, too. He feh perfectly sura that Winnie at present wouldn’t go ten steps out of his w<iy to capture all the outlaws from St Louis to New Orleans. Now, for my part, I am convinced we haven’t any thing to fear from Winnie at tbe present; but-there are only two peaceable ways to get rid of him. The first is to let both him and the girl alone, then they wUl get married and start off.”
“ I object to that; I want her myself," Foxcroft put u\ solidly.
“ The second,” continued Fayette, without taking the alight out notice of the Interruption, “ is for Foxcroft to take th* girl away from him, either by making fiercer love to her than the soldier Is able to do, or else by contriving to produce a quarrel between the two, in some way; but this (matter concerns you, Foxcroft, more than tt doss tbe rest of toh Of course we stand rsady to help yon to any way you

’ A gronl of satisfaction came from the store-keeper, and s cunning look appeared In hi* l»i~
" And ss for the oveneer, we must go tor him again. I think that ws had better try a little .Jiu-Klux on him,': Payette observed, thoughtfully
" Come the Grand Cyclops—be war'I on him?" said Ozark. 11 Exactly, the only difficulty is to get at him."
" Maybe ketch him in de storehouse, some night, dat’s lonely,” Congo auggcjted, for the first time taking part in the oon venation.
•• That is s good idem," Payette replied. " The storehouse is • lonely spot W* mu' arrange it so as to spring the trap upon the ot'onwwr some night when Smith ia away from the plantation; and if the darkies ahould bear a noise —thV U, suppoaing the oreneer shows fight ami makes a struggle—tbe mere sight of ths black gown* wlK be enough to frighten them into fits.”
" We can get Smith into town eaay enough," observed Foxcroft. “ Get your father to tend him a meaange lluit he wiats to aee him about the mortgage, some night.”
“ That ia aimple enough. The moat difficult part of tin matter will be to decoy the oreneer to the store-house,” said Payette. “Are then any blacks on the Smith place that feu think you can depend upon, Congo?”
" Tea, two on ’em."
•• We can fix It then,” Payette observed, In a toue of confidence.
“ What are you going to do with the overseer arter you trap him?" asked Ozark.
" Tell him that the air of this place Is bad for bis health, and that he had better leave,” replied Fayette, significantly.
" And If he wont promise to go?" asked Foxcroft "Take him out In the woods and treat him to a do*, of cowhide administered on the bare bock until he does promise."
Congo lay on whip!” exclaimed the burly negro, with a ferocious glee.
“That's settled, clean aa the trunk of a gum," announced Oaark, In a tone of satisfaction. “ You must gi’n me plenty ef warning when you want me fur to jine in this hyer cow-Ulllon, ‘cos I've got a leetle business up to the Line Ferry on Mulberry crick cornin' off afore long.”
“Wnat business have you got then?” asked Payette, in astonishment.
“ They're gwine to sell the ferry privilege fur next year commencing funt ef May, at auction. I used to row the ferry, you know, afore the war; an' I thought maybe that I would go up an' gi'n 'em a bid," Osark answered.
*• You can't run the fen; yourself,” said Foxcroft; " the soldier* would be after you In no time"
“ I know that well enough, but ef I kin buy the privilege cheap mebbe 1 kin sell it out fur a profit. It's worth fifty dollan a year sure. Anyway, I'm gwine up; 1 want to see •-he fo'ks up thar an' I’ll gi'n one bid, Jes‘ fur luck. Johnson, the sheriff, is the auctioneer, I hearu," Ozark replied.
** After we get the overse«r out of the way, we’ll go for Smith,” Fayette now added. “ I've made up my mlnd that his place shall come under the hammer as soon as the law will allow. Old Smith will never be able to raise the money to pay the mortgage, and the chances are just ten to one that If a sale 'Is forced, the whole plantation wont bring even the face of the mortgage, for timee are hard and money Is scarce."
“ The place ought to be worth fifteen or twenty thousand dollars though, hadn’t it?” asked Foxcroft
“ Oh, yea. everjrcent of it; but, timee are tight Those who have the money mean to hold on to It. Thlnga will work all right tor ua it we get the overseer out of the
Foxcroft, gazing into the fire thoughtfully, did not notice the tonfc of intelligence that passed between Fayette and the outlaw.
Just then a shrill whistle rang out over the surface of tho Wt lagoon, coming front tho swamp shoes.
CHAPTER XXX. » a» Nft htoa be tte AscoeA'
The outlaw left the shanty, and Us confedersSss Sooo heard the light dip of his paddle in the waters of the dark lagoon.
Within five minutes Ozark was back again, accompanied by a light " yellow boy,” about fifteen yean old, with crispy, curly hair, and an expression of low cunning upon his irregular, evil-looking features.
“ Hello, Jim Crow I” exclaimed Payette, as the mulatto stepped within the circle of light; ■“ what brings you hero?"
It was the grandson of old Unde Snow who had entered the abode of the outlaw.
“ I came arter you, Massa Payette," the boy replied, with a grin. “ 1 see’d you and Massa Foxcroft dere walk down de street ’bout nine dls evening, an’ I ’spected dat you was gwine to come to dls yere place to see Massa Ozark."
“ What do you want?” FayeU? asked, totally unable to guess the boy’s purpose in seeking him in the swamp at such an hour.
" Docs you know dat Massa Texas, Gineral Smith’s over eer?" the boy asked.
All were astonished at this question, end even King Congo pricked up his esrs to listen.
" Yes, of course I know him; what of it?" Fayette demanded.
“ He come to aee my gran’fader to night I was up staYs Jea’ gwine fur to sleep when he come In. I heerd him teU de ole man dat he had sotnet’ing ’tlcular to say to him dat he didn’t want nobody fur to hear; so when de ole man come up, I made out dat I was fsa’ asleep, an’ I jea’ heeid At ’hole on it Dere was a yaller nigger named Jupiter an’ he left a tin box full of somet’lng wid de ole man for dis yere Massa Texaa fur to come and git, an’ he’s gwine to guv de ole man a hundred dollar fur it; an’ It’s somet’lng to do wid a gemman dat was killed in de war-time afore de Yanks oome, an’ de overseer, Massa Texas, an my ole man is gwine arter de box de furet t’lngin de morning, afore de sun iraip."
Fayette and Ozark had exchanged glances when «*■ Vad spoken of a man being killed, but neither Foxcroft nr * Congo, Intent on the boy’s story, had noticed the evident understanding.
“ Where Is the box concealed?” Fayette asked.
In de ole cabin on de Mulberry crick road, right ia edge ob de swamp,” Jim Crow answered
“ I know the place I” exclaimed Ozark; " Pre alep: there a hundred times."
" Yes, 1 know where it is situated, too; I have noticed h when I have been riding by on the road.” Payette said, abstractedly. evidently loet in reflection. Then be raised his head and addressed the boy. “ Did you hear them say where about In the cabin the box waa hidden?”
“ No, sar.”
“ We kin find it easy ’noughT asserted the outlaw “ Thar ain't nothing to the cabin but four walls, a mud Door an’ part of a roof."
*' I t’ought maybe dat dere might be somefing good Is dat yere box dal you’d like fur to have, an’ an I done comm to tell you ail ’bout it,” the boy said.
** Jim Crow, you're Jee’ the smartest little nig that thar Is in thit yere county!” exclaimed Ozark. “ Ef yon keep on, you’ll be hung, sure.”
The yellow-boy grinned at the dubious compliment *‘ Ozark, I reckon that you and I had better go after this box; it may contain something of importance; and then again. It may not amount to any thing at aQ. It win do no harm, though, to look after it,” said Fayette. “ I suppoaa, Foxcroft, that you don’t care to tramp five or six miles fcs the swamp?” The fat store-keeper shuddered at the Idas.
“ Bless me, no I" he cried “ It ia quite bad enough to Damp out here, without trying my lack any farther is tbe swamp. I always contrive to step into some enned mod-hole that I never discover until I am np to my knees In w*-ter. And then, to-night, I came within aa inch of treading on i black snake that looked as big round as asy arm.”
“ Nuffin but a common black snake; they don’t Osark said	f	.'".a! iTsj/’e
“ How the deuce was I to knenrf* demandetfTbsesoa, sharply; “ I didn’t stop to ask him whether he'd Mas or not; I couldn’t have jumped any higher it H had been •
my balance and went over Sat on say back in n nest of brambles that nearly tore me-all to pecea. I npaaS'Whl
tt I can hi-l® myself.”	*
** Well try and amsft that aU d&C Vkgrsnn Masks*
** You c*n go back to town, while Oxart and I wfll proceed K the cabin, and search for the tin box.”
“ Tes: Jim Crow here can guide me through the swamp; I should never find my way alone,” Foxcroft said. “ Of course if there are any valuable* In the box, I depend upon you to give me a fair share.”
Fayette and Ozark exchanged a meaning glance again.
“ Certainly,” Fayette said.
" Of course,” Ozark added; “ and If you ain’t satisfied, saubbe III throw in some of my share, too,” and. then the outlaw indulged in a “ horse ” laugh, much to the surprise »f Foxcroft, who didn’t see any thing funny In the observation; but be was too well used to the peculiar moods of the ruff an to question him.
" Oh, ^o, ’ he answered; “I shall be perfectly satisfied with my own share without robbing -you.”
Ozark ferried over Foxcroft and Jim Crcrw and returned for Fayette, leaving Ring Congo in solitary possession of the swamp lair, there to nurse his bruises and meditate dire vengeance upon the strong-armed Man-from-Texas.
Concealing the dug-out amid the brush that fringed the lagoon, Ozark and Fayette proceeded In a north-west direction through the swamp.
Foxcroft and Jim Crow had gone off toward thb landing, leading to the south-west
Ozark led the way; be had the catlike faculty of seeing In the dark, and Fayette followed close behind, treading Indian fashion, In his footsteps.
" How far is it?" asked Fayette.
“ T >ut two miles. ”
"I thought it couldn’t be much further. I said five, though, to frighten off Foxcroft. I knew that he would oever stand a tramp like that. Tou think that we can discover the box?”
K "I «>ckon we kin. I've got a chunk of fat-wood that we kin light with a match. I think I know whar it’s hid. ;The last time I bunked In thar, I noticed a hole In one of > tf.e logs nigh a corner of the cabin, jes’ as if a big grub had 'bored it out. I reckon that it was a human, though.” s: “I say, Ozark, what do you suppose that tin box cot-•‘a5o*t*’ asked Fayette, abruptly.
•' A bill of sale of a horse, or something of that kind, (*ttb your name and mine scratched on the back of it,” Ozark suggested.
£ “ You think, then, that the overseer, Texas, is the son of " and Fayette hewKted.
" Of that Texan drover that you an’ me knew in sixty-'three?” asked Ozsrk bluntly, finishing the speech of the other.
“ He does look like him,” Fayette observed V “ 1 noticed tta resemblance the moment I set eyes cu the cuss that night, ln Ool Adair’s cabin; an* when 1 beerd him "tell what fotrhed him hyer, I reckoned that thar was trouble •Ihead.”
'i . Very few more words passed between the two until they rooxrped from the swamp and stood in the moonlight before lh» deserted cabin.
CHAPTER XXXI.
AN UNEXPECTED DISCOVERT.
AfTKB leaving old Uncle Snow’s shanty the overseer pro (ceded straight to the plantation. The moon was now rising slowly, and lighted up his homeward way.
“ To morrow the paper will be In my hands,” Texas thought, as he strode onward wiUi vigorous steps, “ and then . Ir shall be able to close the account, perhaps. There’s no telling, though, but that the party whose name I shall find traced in characters of blood, is dead or gone far away from here. Speculation now Is only idle guess-work. In the ; morning, an hour after sunrise, I shall know the truth.” i.\ I*, did not take the overseer very long with his lengthy legs .to gut over the distance between Uncle Snow’s cabin and the Eflantalion.
N it a living soul did he meet along the road, and, as be . carae up the carriage-way leading to the house, he saw the |ught coming from tho window of General Smith’s Ubrary, .which j roved that the owner of the plantation had not yet mired to rest
PgThe Ubrary was on the flirt floor, and, with his eyea fixed |§|W*.the lighted window as he advanced, Texas did not gJMice the white-robed figure keeping Its vigil at tbe window second rotj.
Missouri ’.ad watched and waitr4 for'the return of ths
overseer.
She saw i'd come ap th>; sreun* h.sard him enter tbs house and ascend the staira to bis loom, then heard the nolM of the door na he closed It behind him, and after that, sllencs reigned supreme.
. Missouri, sitting in a low rocking chair by tbe open window, resting her bead upon her band, gaaed out dreamily upon the rising moon and reflected.
That the thought* of tbe girl were not very pleasant was evident from the slight frown Uu3 arched her trews and >hu) the Bps so tightly together.
“ Where has he been, I wonder?*' she murmured, tapping her slippered foot petulantly upon the floor. “ He went toward the landing, I am sure. I wonder If be went to see some girl?” And then, the frown upon her face deepened, and the full, red under -Up was compressed spitefully between the little white teeth. “ It’s no business of mine, 1 suppose, but I would like to know, though.” Then sh^ rose to her feet and walked up and down the room fnr a few minutes with a restless, impatient motion.
. “ Ob, dcarl” she -exclaimed, suddenly, " I suppose that I had better go to bed I wish that I liad never seen this fellow; he annoys me dreadfully, and he’s only an overseer too.
I wish that Will Fayette or some other gentleman had been riding out that morning to pull me ott of the river. This fellow, too, doesn't seem to understand that It is quite a condescension for me to treat him as politely as I do; he doesn't seem to notice it at all If I was as black as the ace of spades instead of being a pretty girl, as ('very one say* I am. his couldn’t take less notice of me.”
Then Missouri walked to the swinging glass of the bureau; the rays of the rising moon, growing stronger and brighter each coming minute, shone into the apartir^nt and gav<) jght enough to enable the giri to see her face ln the glass.
“ I’m not so ugly, I know!” she mused “ I wonder If this is>he best way to wear my hair?” she murmured. In a way that plainly betrayed profound thought, and resting both elbows on the bureau she gazed pensively into tbe glass for • few moments, whilf* she pondered over tbe important Question.
Then with a sudden motion, she raised hei hand* and removing the hair-pins allowed the magnificent jet-black tresses to stream down over her shoulders.
“ That is the way I looked when—” then the giri paused and blushed up to her temples; she was annoyed that one subject ipn ever in her thoughts. “What a goose I am!” she exclaimed, petulantly. “ I really believe that I am bewitched. I can think of nothing but of being pulled out ol the water by this fellow. I wish that he bad let me star where 1 was. I’d better go to bed!” And with this abrupt declaration, Missouri proceeded at once to disrobe.
But, even when attired for slumber, and kneeling in prayer by the bedside, the image of the red-coated overseer would come to her despite her determination not to think of him.
Missouri's slumbers, that night, were light and broken. With the first shrill crow of trumpet-tongued chanticleer, the herald of the coming morn, the girl awoke. Turning over restlessly on her side, she endeavored to compose herself to sleep again, and, just as she had closed her eyes with intent to woo tbe presence of balmy slumber’s chain, Uie opening of a-door, followed by the cautious tread of a man’s footsteps, caught her attention. She sat bolt upright in bed and listened for a moment Her ears had not deceived her; ahe heard the step of the overseer.
“Why, it is not yet light,” she murmured; “where caa be be going at this hour?”
To jump up and wrap a loose robe around her was but ths work of a second; then.she sprung to the window, her little white feet pattering almost noiselessly upon the floor-matting.
She heard the stairs creak under the descending tread; . heard the man unlock the front door—the kfey of the massive old fashioned lock always shrieked as if in torture when it turned in the ward* — and then descend the steps, and watched him as in the dull gray light—almost as thick as the gloom of the night—he walked down the carriage-way toward the m&li. road.
Missori watched him until he was out of sight Great was the wonder in the young girl’s mind. No sleep for he* that morning. She dressed herself, and a hundred times ah* put the mental qustion, “What dast it mean?”
The overseer proceeded straight down to tbe road, and a* tbe junction of the private way with the main one, be founo old Uncle 8now waiting for him.

•• Maybe.”
“ Wal, look out for that ring-tailed wild-cat, Yell Ozark; he’s squintin’ arter Tilda himself,” said Qol, wamingly.
“ Me look; not fraid if he was der tuyvel,” Pete returned, as he walked off down the river.
“ That boy’s clear grit from his head to his big toe!” Gol ejaculated, in admiration, after Pete had got out of bearing. 441 would feel a mighty sight easier 'bout him, though, if that pesky varmint, Yell Ozark, was run out of the countij.” *• 1 don’t think that he’U be around much longer,” Winnie ■aid. “ General Smith told me when I was in Little Rock, about • week ago, that he was going to send s squad after Ozark very soon, with ordere not to return until they got him.” *' I don't hsnker after blood much, but a wild beast lias Ozark ain’t fit to Uve,” Gol said, gravely.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
THB “ Lin FURRY. ”
It was on a bright and ploasant ipril morning that Sheriff Johnson started for the county seat of Franklin, to sell the lease of the ferry franchise across Mulberry creek, to the Alghest bidder, according to the law in such cases made and providod.
Johnson was mounted on the same mettled animal which had manifested such decided aversion to Judge Yell’s umbrella, aa has been related; and, as on this occasion it was fresh from the stable, and naturally In high spirits, it be trayed the playful nature of its disposition by shying at every possible object along the road that it could, with any degree of reason, pretend to be afraid of.
The natural consequence was that, for the first two milea, “ Mister ” Johnson swore like a trooper, dug bis heels into the horse’s sides aud Jerked on the bit so vigorously, that half the time the horse was dancing along sideways like a crab, every now and tb«n elevating ita hind legs in the air In a very Bpiteful manner and betraying a disposition to get rid of its rider, by rubbing him off against a convenient tree, every now and then.
Wherefore, Johnson and the horse both arrived at the county seat, sweating profusely, and each one equally dis-gusU'd with the ottw.
The county seat was not s particularly large place; It mmbored possibly a hundred and fifty inhabitants, black •nd white—men, women and children all told.
The court-house was a small one-story building, elegantly 44 painted ” with whitewash, and boasting a “ liberty-pole ” ia the op<-n apace before the door.
As Johnson and the horse came dancing along into the . •e.tfc.ment, the people generally came out to greet the aheriff; Johnson was well known.
- Quite a number of men were assembled, evidently waiting toi the sheriff’s arrival.
Johnson dismounted and fastened the horse.
u You durned brute, TO sell you, font thing you know, ef you ain’t keerfull” exclaimed the official, in wrath, addressing the animal
Johnson’s eyes had resumed their normal sad he dls played no mark of his unfortunate and sudden collision with Judge Yell’s umbrella in Justice Foxcroft’s court.
" What’s the matter, Johnson?” exclaimed one ol the bystanders; 44 yon look riled!”
•’ Well, I reckon you’d look riled ef you had to ride a hoss that wanted to walk on his hind legs all the time,” Johnson retorted, savsgely.
“ How’s things workin’ up to the landing?” asked another ooe of the Uttle group
Bus’neas dull, an’ money's skeerce,” answered the &h»r-iff, laconically. ” Now, gentlemen, ef youll Jes’ git off than yere steps, an’ gi’n me a show for my money, weU come to bus’ness.”
The loungers on the steps of the court-house got up slowly and made way for the sheriff, who mounted the steps while the Uttle crowd gathered round him.
Johnson drew a legal-looklng document from his pocket and went ahead with the auction.
'• Now, feUow-cltlzens, I'm going to offer at public safe, ’cording to law, the lease of the ferry privilege over Mulberry crick, known to you all as the ‘ Line Ferry,’ and which win be sold to the highest bidder. Now, gents, let me hear frotr you; how much am I offered?”
Just then a new-comer attracted the Uttle throng aud la terrupted the sale.
Round the corner of the court-house, from what wu known as the East Road, rode YeU Ozark, mounted on s -arge gray mule, and carrying his double-barrel shot-giM across his lap, the hammers of both barrels draw* back ready for action.
Yell approached so quietly up the road that he was uprr the crcwd before they knew It, and about tSe first intime lion that Johnson had of the presence of the dreaded outlaw was *«eing him halt directly in front of him, not twenty fe»* away.
Johnsor turned gale he held the ferry lease in his right hand and made a motion with it toward the pocket of bl* coat as if with intent to draw a weapon.
The crowd took in the situation at a glance, and anticipating trouble, began to edge away from the steps, so ss * got out of range of the terrible “ double-barreL”
Ozark's quick eyes, too, had noticed the motion, and fulxj understood the only half-formed purpose of the sheriff.
“ How do yon do, Mister Johnson?” exclaimed the rufflxi nodding to the sheriff. “ I hope I see you well? I saj Johnson, you hain't got any idee of drawin' a we’pon on m«v air you? 'coe you ought to know that I could put a ball plur» through you afore you could git any we'pon out Have yo* got any fuss with me?”
“ No, of course not, Mr. Ozark,” replied Johnson, quickly a long breath of relief coming from his lips and his fao« brightening up when ho discovered that the outlaw had no* sought him with hostile intent.
“ I reckon that thar ain’t any gentleman hyer that’s go* any fuss with me, is thar?” demanded the horseman, looklnf round upon the crowd with a smile upon his sallow features “ 'Coqtef thar is, all he's got to do is to step out, draw hi* we’pon, an’ we kin settle it now as well u any othei time.”
But one and all of the crowd assured Mr. Ozark that they entertained the most friendly sentiments toward him, and strange to relate, two-thirds of the throng assembled thew before the court-house spoke the truth. Composed as It wa> of “ poor whites," nearly all of them looked upon Ozark ai a sort of persecuted man.
“ For my part, I ain’t got anythin' ag’ln' any one hyer,’ added Ozark; •' I Jes’ rode into town to attend this hyer aur tlon, an’ make a bid for the ferry, mebbe. Mow, Miste> Johnson, go ahead with your sale."	,
The crowd looked at one another; they began to under stand why the outlaw bad ridden into the county seat th* bright April morning.
Johnson repeated the announcement In regard to the sale, and again asked:
** How much do I hear for the ferry lease?"
“ Two dollars I" shouted Yell, at the top of his vole*, and then, quick as a flash, be snatched the double-baneled gun up from his lap and with bis finger on the trigger, poised the barrel on his left band. . “ I bid two dollars for this
yere ferry rcase, an1 I’d like to see the man who dares to bid sg'ln’ me!”
The members of the crowd around tbe Bteps, and tbe sheriff on them, looked a little uneasy at the threatening attitude of the ruffian, but, as he made no further motion, little by little their composure returned to them.
"Come, go ahead with the sale, Johnson!” Yell exclaimed; “ dog-gone ef I want fur to stay hyer in the hot sun all day f”
Thus encouraged, the sheriff proceeded.
“ How much am I offered—two dollaro—two dollars—do I hear any more?—two dollars!”
But Johnson might have yelled two dollars until he wa* gray; not one of that crowd would top the bid of Yell Ozark, backed by the awful double-barreled shot-gun.
"Two dollars! Why, gentlemen, it’s worth fifty at the least 1 can’t knock it down for two dollarst” Johnson laid.
" Look hyer, Johnson, I don’t want to have any fuss with yon." Ozark remarked, quietly; “but I stand on my rights. You're to sell this hyer ferry lease to the highest bidder. I’ve bid two dollars, an’ if thar ain’t anybody bids over that, •cording to law, you’ve got to knock that lease down to me."
This terse and forcible argument was quite enough for Johnson; and, after a few more calls, the “Line" ferry lease was knocked down to Yell Ozark for the ram of two dollars. And that gentleman immediately resold It to Billy Brown, who was running the ferry then, fnr flftv-two dollars, invited the crowd, mc.uding Shenfl Johnson, to tate a drink with him, which they all did, and then rode out of town.
Johnson found himself quite an object of Interest when be got back to the landing, and related the particular! of the auction.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
BOTH DEPTNK8 HIS POBITIOH.
About three days after the one on which the auction had taken place, General 8mith and his overseer sat out on the prairie together, smoking. It was just after supper, snd the twilight was beginning to thicken into the gloom of night.
The General had just been imparting the way his affairs stood to the overseer. The first of May was approaching very rapidly, and as yet he saw no way out of the quicksand of debt in which he was engulfed.
“ 1 owe old Fayette about four thousand dollars, due the flrst of next month,” he said, "and, even if he is willing to let the principal stand, I must pay the back interest, and that is a thousand dollars sure, and maybe a little over. Then, for seed, tools and supplies, 1 owe five hundred more. Thiit, of course, don’t press me like the other, but I ought to pay a little on it next month. I’ve got supplies enough to last the hands and stock till the first of August, I think; but, even if I tide over to then, I shall be floored without 1 can ralsfc a little money someway."
“ Get an advance on crop,” suggests Texas.
" I have already had a thousand dollars," exclaimcd the General, impatiently; " I ran so far behind last year that I had to get the money, even before the crop wa in the ground. I tell you what it is, Mr Texas, when a man on*e gets behind it’s deuced hard work for him to pall up again. Nothing so hard as paying for a dead horse.” The General rcse and paced restlessly up and down the piassa. “ If that Infernal insurance company would only make some settlement on my claim, If It was only twenty-five cents on the dollar, the ready cash would pull me through!” the General exclaimed, Impatiently. “ If the president, or secretary, or any other official of that blamed concern would only write me a letter and say that I could have twenty-five or fifty per cent within six months or so, that would da I could raise tbe money on the letter alone, bnt I’m ashamed to go to a friend and ask him to loan me a thousand dollars or so, knowing that I can’t give him any security whatever, and that if anything happens to me, be would never get a cent from my estate."
“ But, haven't yon heard any thing from tbe insurance company lately?" Texas asked.
“ Not a word since I came back. I saw the agent in Little Rock, and he assured me that the affairs of tho company wan not near so bad as had b*ec represented, and that
he felt sure a dividend would be declared very soon. Sob* law case, involving a very heavy sum, had been decided in favor of the company, and the assets had turned out much better than had been expected.. He told me he would see that I had a full examination of just how affaire stood from the receiver in charge of the thing as soon as be got back to Memphis; but, as yet, I haven't heard a word. I'm going into town to-night; 1 had a message from old Fayette,. this afternoon, that he would like to see me this evening if I could make it convenient to come. I suppose he wants to talk the matter over and see what I propose to do In the premises."
*• Going ln right away?”
“ Yes, Sam is saddling my horse now," the General replied. •• If you have nothing better to do, ride In with me.’*
“ I should really likely to, General," the overseer answered, “ but the darkies haven’t got back with that load of com yet, and I think I bad better attend to that being put in the storehouse myself."
“ Yes, yes, of course,” the General said, quickly. “ Mr. Texas, It gives me great pleasure, sir, to state to you that I am more than satisfied with youi management since yov have been on my place. As yon honestly said, you were ■ little green about the duties of an overseer; but yon werr willing to work and quick to learn, and you get more work out of the negroes than any other man I have ever seen. You have good ideas about improving things, too. If i had had you to advise me to put a few acres ln eorn last yeai os you have done this spring, I should have been" a great deal better off. I think your argument is sound. W* Southern planters trust loo much to cotton, so that when w« have a bad year we have nothing to fall back on."
" I'm much obliged for the compliment, General,” th* overseer said, his face flushing up a little. “ I’ve tried to do my best, and as for the darkies, 1 merely keep ’em to theb work, that's all."
“ Yoy have an excellent, systematical way with you; thv* accounts for it By the way, Mr. Texas,” said the General, very abruptly, “ excuse the question, but haven't you served ln ’.he army?"
“Why should you think that, General?" asked the over seer, quietly, and with no trace of embarrassment in his man ner.
“ Well, I fancied I detected s sort of military way with you. I noticed, too, that you have s habit of detailing tho hands in squads. I thought, perhaps, that you had served during the late war.”
“ You’re wrung there, General; I had nothing to do wltk the war. I never lifted a flngor on either side," ths overseer replied.
" Probably a fancy, but I would have bet almost any thing, sir, th9t you had served."
Just lien Sam’s appearance with the General's horse put a stop tc the conversation, and mounting, Smilh set out foi town.
"Those fellows got back with the wagon yet?" Ton* asked, after the General had ridden off.
“ No, sar," Bum replied.
“ What the deuce can keep them?" the overseer ex claimed.
“ I dunno, sar,” Sam said, doubtfully, scratching his head in deep thought; " 1 s’pects, dough, Massa Texas, dat dem brack rascalums has done made beasts of demselves wid bad whisky down to de landin’.”
" That’s very likely; you had better saddle up t hom snd ride into town and see what has become of them."
“Yes, sar, I’ll done fotch 'em I”
In five minutes Sam was in the saddle and off.
The overseer lit a fresh cigar and listened until the sounf of the horse's hoofs ceased in tbe distance.
“ That box bothers me,” his thoughts ran on, as ha tilted his chair back on its hind legs and puffed a huge volume of smoke Into the air. “ There’s only one person iu this world besides myself who could possibly have any motive to get possession of the paper in the box, and that Is the man who murdered my father, and whose name is scratched ln strokes of blood across tho back of the paper. But, how could that person possibly learn of the existence uf the box, and the terrible evidences that it contained? That is a mystery. The old negro evidently knew nothing of the contents of th* box; and A had not been, apparently, disturbed in its hiding-place sincc il had been placed there. Can it be that tb* whole story of the negro, Jupiter, is but fiction, and that the paper he described never had an existence except in hie
This wu t new view of the csss, one thst tHtd uSVer occurred to the mind of the overseer before. IWil-. 'sfler fc fe# momenti’’reflection he saw that there were strong point* against it.
■	3 *• That can not be the truth,” he mused. “ What object eould Jie negro gain by coining sucb a story? The watch snd ring were my father's, I am sure; I’ve seen them a thousand times. Then, too, the moment I got hold of the paper 1 should have known whether it was my friher’s Handwriting or a forgery. Thai my father is Aui is almost a certainty, for be has never been seen since Bixty-ihree, aud, if he is in tbe world, I surely would have heard from or of him in all these years, for he was well aware of •my address at 8an Antonio It settles right down to this: first and foremost, the story of the yellow boy, Jupiter, is true; cay father was nrirdered in this neighborhood and before he died Jupiter found him, and my father, with his quilt toothpick, r rote the name of bis murderer on the back of some legal paper i-hat he happened to have Id his possession, and that be usei. the blood coming from his death-wound for ink: true, too, that the mulatto buried the body and hid the paper in the tobacco-box, and then concealed it in the old cabin, from which it has been stolen by some one. Only one person has any reason to wish to gel possession of that paper Ergo then, If I discover the person who took the $aper from the tin-box, I shall, at the same time, discover She man who murdered my father. There, I think I have reduced that down pretty clean.”
CHAPTER XXXV.
TH* HXJlRT o» a princess B> had hardly finished his train of cogitation and mental comment, when he heard the rustle of a woman's dress, and turning his head, he beheld Missouri advancing along the piazza from the doorway.
The .girl had cast a vail over her head, half-concealing the long curls that floated down her back nearly to her waist. Pretty Missouri had magnificent hair.
The overseer rose from his seat.
•	- Isn’t my father here?” she asked.
; ; No, Miss," Texas replied; “ he went into town, only a Ittle while ago.”
\ “What s beautiful night It l*r Missouri murmured, half V> herself, gazing up at the starry heavens above.
| “ Won’t you sit down, Miss?” Texas said, respectfully, placing a chair for tbe girl as he spoke.
Thank you,” she ssid, very sweetly, accepting the proffered seat “ Are you learned in star-gazing, Mr. Texas?” r **A little,” he responded. He had made a movement as It to retreat from the piazza, but the question restrained him.
■“Yes, Miss, a little," he repeated.
C;**Gome and point out the Pleiades to me.”
The overseer approached, and as he did so, cast away the cigar which he held ln his hand, thougb it was not a quarter consumed.
The girl noticed the action in surprise.
*• You have thrown away your cigar,” she said.
•'Certainly, whan a lady la present"
•• On my account?”
“ I shall either have to say that it was, or tell you a story," be replied, bluntly.
Missouri looked at th® overseer with considerable astonishment manifested in her face at the frank confession, and Texas added: " 1 don’t pretend to be much of a gentleman, but I was brouphC-up not to smoke in the presence of ladies.” This strange-talking young overseer was a complete puzzle to the haughty viung Southern giri. At one moment he used «s coarse and rough expressions as any rude frontiersman on the bordei, and the next gave utterance to sentiments that should only come from a gentleman by birth and breed .tag.
iij What a treasure your wife will have I” Missouri said, half Is Jest, half in earnest
“Yes, when 1 get one," tbe man replied, with s laugh;
; "you see, Miss, I’m *• rough, plain msn, and I don’t take ‘utuioh stock-in womin in general."
So much the better for one in particular,” Missouri ob- ' Served, tartly.
' Tbe overseer laughed; he felt that he had been well answered. For a moment or two thar* was silence; then Missouri spoke, abruptly:
“ How do you like our pises. 5Jr. Texas?" KvHsnUy As
was forgetting all about the star subject
“ Very well indeed; It’s a fine place, Miss. I think that I may reckon myself pretty tolerably lucky to get such a good situation as I have here, with yoOr father.”
Missouri’s little white teeth compressed the scarlet trades lip for a moment The words of the young man annoyed her. Why did he always contrive to keep the fact that be was her father’s overseer before her mind—that, instead 0» being a friend, he was only a hired man, but a grade or so above the tawny-colored freedmen who tilled her father’s fields? Did he do it on purpose? Was he intent upon keeping the fact before her mind that she was General Smith's daughter and he but her father’s overseer?
These thoughts coursed rapidly through the young girl’s brain as she rested her cheek on her hand, supporting ths elbow on the arm of the chair, and gazed out vacantly upon the broad fields of the plantation.
But why should he act ln such a manner? Did he think that she was over-forward in speaking to him? It could not be that, for her ewn heart told her she had hardly treated him with common politeness since he had come on the place, and then, loo, her conscience smote her when she reflected that tbe cool, red-coated stranger had saved her life when a grave beneath tbe yellow sands of the Arkansas seemed sur* to be her fate. True, he had mortally wounded her dignity by his ill-timed remarks, comparing her to s drowned rat at the very moment of salvation, when her heart was full to overflowing with gratitude to the man who had come as a rescuing angeL
No, she would crush back her pride and treat the stranger better in the future. She did not forget that the man had claimed and obtained his reward for the service he had res* dered her, but then she could not help acknowledging that • tingle kiss was but a slight recompense for a life saved.
“I am afraid, Mr. Texas, yon must think that I am a very strange girl,” she said, with a sudden outburst “I have never told my father how nobly you saved my life, and I am sure that, since you have beea here, I have not really treated you as you deserve to be treated!”
The eager tones of the young and beautiful giri, almost plaintive in their expression, the moist eyes, so large and lustrous, and the earnest face, all combined to enchain the soul of the young man in the silken meshes of passion. For a single instant be wavered; but then before his eyes rose the fonn of s murdered father c&lliog aloud for vengcatce, and wlih a mighty effort he stilled the leaping blood wiC/n hi* veins, that already had begun to run riot under the in£ueaco of love’s delicious soell, A moment only, and then be became a man of ice again.
“ Wa'.,” he said, slowly, the South-western accent coming out stroug, “ 1 r'ally think that it would have been a good idea ef you had told the old man, for then be might have given tre a little more wages."
Just a single instant, Missouri looked Into the face of the overseer; then, quick as a flash, she sprung to her feet, an angry light Bbining in her great, black eyes, and yet her lips were trembling as if she found it hard work to keep back the tear-drops.
The-Man from-Texas had overshot the mark. He was not aware that the General had told his daughter all the particulars of the first interview with the applicant for the over-seership, and that the stranger had refused to accept any wages whatever until his abilities were tested. Knowing these facts, Missouri’s mortification at hearing the overseer make sucb a "mean” confession, can easily be imagined.
“Mr. Texas, I am not a very wise giri, I know, but I am not so great a fool as you seem to take me to be!" she said, in a low and trembling voice; she could not repress her agi-tation nor conceal it “ You are playing a part to me, sir, and it Is unworthy of you. I made a candid confession that ] had not treated you right since you have been here, but it is. half your fault Ever since I have known you' you havn Men doing all you'can to make me hate you, but I won’t— I ux?n’</" 8h£ repeated, ^temping her foot, pettishly, “and you shanVmiike me. I was going to ask your	just
now, and to tell you that in the future I would treat you ss a woman ought to treat a man who has saved her life. And I don’t care how mean you set, you sha’n’t make me treat you any other way!”
The overseer stood like a marble image, gazihg upon the convulsed face and heaving bosom of the young girl—Juno and Niobe strangely commingled. He made no effort to her speech nor to answer.
Don’t' you understand, sir, I am a Southern girl?’’ ahe exclaimed with a Uttle, Imperious stamp of tlie foot, “Hi Bard for me to confess that I have been in the wrong, but 1 hare done It. I know that you have been making a fool of me, and I have acted like a great goose, but that’s over now, sO^on needn’t play your part any more. You are a gentlo-rtsn even if you are an overseer, and I know It; there now I"
And then Missouri swept proudly into the house with the air of an Eastern, queen, but, truth compels the statement, that she immediately went up to her room, and flinging herself on her bed, began to cry like a child.
"Smitlr Isn't a very royal name, but that girl has got the bean of a princess In her body," the overseer said.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
THE BLACK RIDERS.
A horseman came galloping up the road, and Texas could hear the nimble of a heavy wagon in the distance.
The rider was Sam.
“ You found ’em, ehf Texas asked, descending to the ground from the piazza.
“ Yes, sar; dat Joe is Jes' as drunk as a b'iied owl, sar, and de odder one ain’t much better. Dem’s two big sc ally-waglums, Massa Texas," Sam replied.
•‘■Ride back and have them go direct to the store-bouse. TO cut across the plantation."
“ Tes, sar.” Then Sam rode off to Intercept the wagon, while Texas hastened to the store-bouse. it was a square building built out of hewn logs about a couple of hundred feet back of the stable.
The door was fastened by an immense padlcck which the overseer unlocked and then entered tho building. Lighting s candle, he sat down to await the coming of the wagon.
The store-bouse was used for the more bulky supplies, such as baga of corn and oat?, and bales of bay, straw, eta
In about five minutes the wagon arrived. As Sam bad
•aid, the two blacks in charge ef It seemed considerably the worse foe liquor; but as they were still able to work, Texas told Sam be needn't wait, and proceeded to set the two bands to Unload the wagon and stow away the bags of corn In the house, whiie Sam proceeded to the stable.
It did not take long to unload the wagon, and the moment the work was finished, the overseer started the blacks off to put the mules up, while he lingered for a moment in the store-house to make a memorandum of bow many bags had been brought by the wagon.
Texas sat down on a bale of hay, and proceeded to check the account.
TTnrdly had his pencil made the first mark when the door was thrown suddenly open, and, four figures, wrapped in black cloaks, with their faces hidden by black masks, through which shone gleaming eyes, entered the store-bouse, closing the door behind them. Each one of the masked men carried a revolver, cocked and loaded; and tie last one of the four, a giant In size, carried a little coil of rope on “his arm, and the end that swung from his hand was adjusted in a hangman's noose.
The-Man from-Texas looked up in unaffected astonishment at this sudden irruption of somber and threatening
figures.
But the overseer never rose from his seat upon the bale of hay, he still held the note-book upon his knee, and the pencil was still raised to make this stroke; his nerves were surely of iron.
“ Four on ’em," he muttered, between his teeth, “ and I don’t believe It’s a very good night for Ku Kluxes, either."
Although this was the first lime that Texas had ever been Drought face to face with any of the night marauders who assumed the disguise of black cloaks1 and masks, he guessed st once who his visitors Wete.
The masked ruffians, who, under the name of Ku Elm, save committed such terrible outrages in the South, had quite a playful origin. At first reckless young men, who were eager for a little fun, assumed horrible disguises, and rode in squads at night for the purposes of frightening simple-minded negroes; and by taking advantage of that terror, shut them within doors at night and to keep them from nocturnal plundering mursions upon tht property of the whits
3
As the night-riders were always completely disguised, the rogues and thieves soon adopted the cloaks and masks to cover their purposes; then the politicians took It up—particularly when it was necessary to get rid of some office-holder who couldn't be frightened away by words. And at the lime of which we write-—1868—the Ku Klux bands were a terror and a disgrace to various parts of the South, and were used more for the purpose of covering traces of personal quarrel, and for the satisfaction of private vengeance than any thing else, though earnestly preached against by the leading men of both the political parties. The victims, as a general rule, were strangers, or upholders of the dominant party. The Government at this timo had. not cruahe4 out Ku Kluxism with the iron heel of military power.
“ Stranger, listenl" said the masked man in the advance.
In a hoarse voice, evidently assumed.
” Jes’ hold on a minute, fellow-citieena, till I get through with this ciphering, and I will attend to your cases.” the overseer replied, cool as an icicle, and apparently Dot in the least disturbed by the presence of his strange visitors. Then he went on with his calculation.
" Sixteen bags of corn from Scott and Company, received April 16th, correct!" Then he closed his book and returned it and the pencil to his pocket
The masked men looked at each other in some little astonishment. The coolness of the man puzzled them Ii »u evident he was not at all frightened.
“ Now, my brethren, spit it out; what Is tit Vro you? man,” said Texas.
“ The clock has struck twelve—"
“ Hold on!” exclaimed the overseer, quickly, interrupting the chief of the Ku Klux; " that clock is wrong; it isn't ten yet”
" Do not dare to trifle with us I" cried the masked man, sternly. “ We are the Ku Klux Klan—your doom is fixed —you die at twelve."
“Recorded!" groaned tbe rest of the masted men, la solemn chorus.
“ Played out!” ejaculated the overseer, contemptuously.
*' You can't skeer me worth a cent! Take off your lion-skins; your ears betray that you arc only a lot of jackasseal" Tbe masked men got angry at this, and made a step to ward the overseer, but he faced them with an undaunted look and never moved.
“ Hash man! V\ hy tempt our vengeance bj empty boasts!" cried Uie chief of the four. “ We, tbe dreaded Ku Klux Klan. the riders of the night, whom, from empty skulls, drillk of the warm and living blood—"
"Oh, go to thuuder!” cried Texas, rising in contempt.
“ See here, now ; this has gone jest about far enougn. Tot* may be able to play this on the niggers, but you can’t on me.
I’ll give you just five minutes to get out of this shanty, or I'll just go In and clean you out the whole lot of yon, though I haven’t got a weapon I can stand a joke as well as most men, but this is a little too much for good nature.”
Tbe Ku Kluxers understood at once the mistuke that the overseer was laboring under. He had taken the whole affair to be a practical joke.
“Ozark, show yourself,” commanded the chief; “convince the stranger that we are in dead earnest.”
The second one of the masked men removed the covering from his face and revealed the features of the outlaw.
Texas was astonished. He knew Ozark by reputation, and recognized him at once from-the description given of him.
“I’m Veil Ozark, 1 am,” growled the oulisw; "mebbe you’ve heard of me I”
“ This is no joke; we mean business every time,” cried the Ku Klux leader, sternly. “ We give you twenty-four hour*’ warning to leave this place—this county. If you are found within the limits of Franklin after that time, may the Lord have mercy on your soul.”
“ Why do you order me awayj" Texaa demanded, consid erably mystified by these strange proceedings.
“ That is our business,” returned the masked man, sternly.
“ I haven’t trod on anybody’s toes since I've been here thal f I’m aware of,” Texas expostulated.
" Seek not to question, but obey,” said the masked man.
“ TO see you in the bottomless pit first!" replied the over seer, with uncommon energy.
Tbe masked men started in surprise.
" You refuse to gor” cried the Ku Klux leader, in a tone of menace.
©RAPTER XXXVII.
UNFORTUNATE MSS BUTTEHPLT.
Mtbsoubj extended upon her bed with her face burled in the pillow; sobbing as if "her heart Would break, beard the sound tot Sam’s horse’s hoofs as he galloped np and then rode alray again; then sho heard the overseer descend the creaking steps and the low rumble of the wagon u It passed by the housn on ha way to the store-room.
& was probably a quarter of an hour, at least, before Missouri recovered her composure. Then she rose from the bed, lighted a candle and sat down by the-window to meditate.
Long and thoughtfully she reflected upon What had passed between her and the overseer.
“ I suppose that I acted like a silly child, and that he won't have the best opinion in the world of me," she murmured; “ but I couldn’t help it I knew that he was making believe, and I couldn’t have Helped telling him I knew It, If I had died for it"
Then she looked out of the window over the fields toward the store-houBe, as if she expected tiiat her eyes would pierce alike the gloom of the night and the wall of the log-cabln, and so reveal to her sight the form of the oveneer.
Five or ten minutes she had sat In deep meditation by the window, when she heard a low scratching on the door. That was Butterfly’s knock, snd a moment after the door opened and the young negro girl came in, looking frightened half to death.
“ What’s the matter, Butterfly? Tour eyes art as Mg u saucers’’
“ Oh, bress de Lord, missy, dey’s comet” exclaimed the girt, sinking on her knees in an agony of terror.
Missouri rose from her seat in wonder. She saw ai once that something very unusual must have occurred to produce such a state of terror, tor Butterfly was quite courageous by nature.
“ What U the matter, Butterfly? Can’t you tell me—what has come?"
“ Ohl we’s all gwine to be killed I” and then the girl commenced to rock herself to and fro and to howl dismally.
“ Stop your crying at once, Butterfly!" exclaimed Missouri, ftrmly but kindly. “ Tell, me what you have seen. Is It something on tbe stairs or in your room?”
“ Oh. no, missy,” the girl sobbed. “ Oh, fbre de Lord, save us poor sinners! Dey’s out dar, missy,” and then the girl pointed through the open window trward the stables and store-house
Missouri’s heart gave a great leap aa4 for a moment she felt a choking sensation in her throat.
She darted at the girl and seising her by the shoulder, nised her bodily from the floor.
"Tell me instantly what you have seen and where I” ahe sxclalmed. excitedly, and in her nervous agitation, she gave the unfortunate Butterfly a good shaking which had the effect of bringing her partially to her senses.
44 Df.v> all out dere by de store-house an* in de store-house wid Miuaa Texas. 1 was cornin’ from aunt Dinah’s house an’ I see d tm wid my own two lookin’ eyes!” the girl howled.
"Haw who?” exclaimed Missouri, almost in despair of ever getting liny information from the terrified girL
“ Docn debils wid black t’ings, dat rides nights for to eat poor niggers!" cried Butterfly.
“The Ku Kluxl”
Missouri started back in horror, weak as a child, and Butterfly went down on the floor, all in a heap, with a most
dismal howL
The girl was well aware of the terrible nature of the generality of the visits of the masked men, and her heart trem Wed for the overseer.
“Waa anyone else there?” she demanded, with a great sffort stilling her agitation.
“No, missy; dere was a hundred of dem went into de house arter Massa Texas, an’ one. on dem stayed outside,” the uegiees said, between her howls of terror.
Missouri understood at once that this statement waa a Uttle
^h^T^pressed her hand upon her heart as though by that act she would calm its tumultuous throbbings.
“ Oh, Heaven, givo me strength in this my hour of need!" she murmured. WL’dly the thoughts flashed through her tirain; desperately she essayed to think of some plan to rescue the overseer from the terrible danger which threatened him.
Her first impulse was to send for the fleld-handa to go to >*e assistance at Texas, but instantly rejected tha Idea, aa
ahe thought of the terror these midnight riden ami.; among tho superstitions blacks.	’ ' * °Kl"
Then she thought of Sam; she know that he had MftrettM' the Union army, and having smelt powder on the field Ot battle, -would dot be so apt to give way to the Kn Klux fear.
Then to Missouri’s nilud canSethe thought that, while superintending the arranging of the overseer’s room that morning, shd had seen his revolvers lying in the bureau drawer.
“ Oh, Heaven!” She murmured; “he Is unarmed and in their hands!” Then a sudden idea came into her head. “ With the revolvers, Sam and 1 might be able to frighten them off.*
Missouri proceeded at once to ttie overseer’s room. A* she had expected, the; two revolvers were in the drawer. Securing them, she perceived that every chamber was loaded
Then, followed by Butterfly, who was trembling in every limb with terror, and therefore kept close to the heels of her mistress, Missouri went at once to the stable.
As usual, Sam had a choice collection of familiar spirits with him.
Missouri called him out and briefly explained the situation
to him.
Sam’s military ardor was inflamed In a minute.
“ By golly, I ain’t afeard of dem rascals!” he exclaimed “ I fit ’em when 1 was in de army, an’ dey can’t skeer me •kase dey’s got dar faces kivered up. Pve got my musket inside an’ dor's five or six good boys in dar fur to help us; dey kin yell, if dey can’t fight. 1 Jes’ tel] ’em dat dere’s ti me chicken-thieves down round de store-house, an’ I won't sot nnffln’ ’bout dem brack riders, ’kase dat will skeer ’em. You see, missy, dey ain’t fit fur Cncle Sam, like I have.1'
Then Sam went Inside, got bis musket and assembled his .ollowers. Five minutes after the " army ” was on its way jo rescue th* overseer.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
AM IAJBV VTOTOBV.
“ Reh-usb to go?” exclaimed Texas, repeating the words of the masked man; "of course I refuse I I don’t acknowledge your rigtit to order me away. What have I done W you or to any of the people of this county? You ought te consider me a good Southern-rights man, for I have whaled a sarcy nigger like thunder since I've been here. ’’
A hoarse growl of rage came from the gigantic figure ia black, who held the rope, at this announcement
“The Ku Klux Klin do not give their reasons,” said tha leader of the band, sternly. “ Enough that you have been marked for death by the mystic brotherhood of the South, unless you instantly quit this place. The Grand Cyclops has spoken; the single eye is upon you and you must obey.” “Brotherhood of the South!” exclaimed the overseer, in contempt; “ that’s a lie! You’re a set of scallywags, th« whole lot of you; a band of mean, cowardly cut throats that take advantage of the darkness and a disguise to satisfy pri vate and personal grudges. No true man, North or South, will hide his face behind a mask and stab his enemy without giving him a chance for his life. You’re a cowardly Bet of miserable, sneaking cowards! Fire and be hanged to you) You’ve got arms and are four to one, but if you don’t kill me first fire, Til strangle one or two of you before I get through.”
Weaponless and alone, but with every muscle in his frame swelling with indignation, The-Man-from-Texas defied the Ku Klux band The cowardly assault had wrought him to such a pitch of rage that death had no terrors for him.
At this critical period, when the revoWeri of the masked ruffians were about to lodge their leaden contents inn the body oi the reckless overseer, clear and Bhrill a woman’* voice sounded on the air.
“ Here they are, father, in the store-house!”
Then followed the hoarse voice of the violent Sam.
“ Furst company forward Jby de flank; second battalim take ’em in de rear! Ready—fire!”
Then came a scattering volley of shots, followed by a yaB that rung in tbe ears of the masked men like the knell of impending doom.
The unceremonious way in which the Ku Klux band left that store-house and got upon their horses and flew, fully proved that retreating waa their “best holt”—to use tbs “ Westernism.”
The raising of tha siege was performed so quickly Uu* oven the overseer was taken by surprise.
Another yell, more powerful than the first, csme from tie Spe of fiwn and his "army"as they beheld tbe sadden flight •*,i*VN*ck riders.
its for the members of the Ku Klux band, they were Vmlv convinced that old General Smith had armed all the tegroes on the plantation and had planned a deliberate stack for the purpose of capturing the whole par’y.
“ Tofl Infernal fools!" growled the leader of the Band— who was no other than Win Fayetto—enraged that he had fielded to sudden fear and allowed himself to be carried away by the headlong rush of the rest; “ why didn't you stand* lit was only Smith and the negroes, srd they won’t fight"
“Tbey’U flgbt like blue blazes, sometime*," exclaimed Ozark, in reply; don’t yon remember tbe fljrht at Jenkin’s Ferry, or. the battle of the Saline, as the Yanks call itr Tlie nigs fought like devils thar."

A grave look settled upon the face of the overseer as bs listened to the recital
“ A fair offer it seems to me," be said, slowly.
“ Yes, it depends upon Missouri now. I shall see her tomorrow. Goodnight.”
And the two retired.

Matilda Fobsyth, or Til* termed, was not what might b was tall In stature, lean in fli green-gray eyes, and a sallow (

“Oh, Brindlel you, Brindler'	|
Then out into the road came, not the col the outlaw, Yell Ozark, armed to the teethJ bearing the trusty shot-gun in his hand I “ Is you lookin’ fur your cow, Tildaf” he |
“Yes,” the girl answered, coldly.	I
" I see’d the beast an hour or so ago down brake,” he said. “ She’ll start fur home jesl

“ Yes,” replied the girl, sharply, latent hostility In her voice and manner.	r. .
“ See hyer!’’ exclaimed the outlaw, after studying the matter over in his mind for a moment “ I reckon that you ain’t right glad fur to see me.”
“ Well, I reckon I ain’t" replied the Ozark was a little staggered by this s " What’s the matter with ye, Til dar “ What fuss hev you got with ms? allers been a friend of yours.”
“ 8mall thanks to you," retorted Tfldi better take your friendship whar son cUle don’t.”

Ozark; was thunderstruck; he had never been talked to in ibis fashion in all his life. If the speaker had been a man,
, he wou’d have shed bis heart’s blood there and then, and he jell half inclined to do so as it was, but with an effort he ^ restrained his angry passion.
Why, Tiida, you're a reg’lar wild-catl" he Baid, with a forced laugh; he was trying to treat the aff:iir as a joke. " Vour sister, now, was a reg’lar lamb.”
" And you killed her with your cruelty, you dumed coward!” .the girl exclaimed, fiercely, her anger so intense that . She hardly knew what she was saying. “ Oh, you needn’t . finger the lock of your shot-gun; I ain't skewed of ye. It’s lucky for you. Yell Ozark, that you didn’t git me instead of my sister, fur the furst lime you laid the weight of a tinker on me, I would have wailed till you got asleep, an' I'd shot off yer hull bead wid yer own gun!”
Ozark ground hi9 teeth together and made a motion as if to cock tho gun, but the girl never flinched
“ 1 ain’t afoard of you!” she repeated; “you don’t dar" to kill me. 1 ain’t a nigger, nor a radical ossifer; you lech me, and you’ll have every decenl white man in the county ar-tcr yer, an’ they’ll ketch ye an'string ye up like a dog, as you ought to be, yon mean, poor white trash!”
This was too much; Ozark fell that he bad to leave or else do the girl a mischief, and that was not prudent.
“ I've a giKxl mind to smack you right over!” he cried, raising his hand, threatening!}’, whereupon the girl, never shrinking from tbe contest, pul berself in a position, not only to guard against hut to return the blow.
Then it suddenly occurred to Ozark that, unless he used his weapons, in an affair of fisticuffs the gaunt, strong-lir.ilicd girl, who o'ertopped him three inches at least, would,
. In all probability, be more than a match for him, and that it ni’ght end in his getting thrashed by a woman.
With a violent effort the outlaw swallowed his passion, and (baking bis fist at the girl, exclaimed:
“ I’ll git even with you, vit!” and then he plunged into •jij Lash by the road side from which he had come.
Then the girl went down toward the cane-brake after the oow, but met Orindle proceeding slowly homeward before she had gol half-way.
A little after sundown Pete called in. Tilda related to him her encounter with the outlaw, and warned him to look oui for himself, for Ozark would probably ai tempt to shoot lain he discovered his visits to the house.
Afu-r supper the lovers—for that was the relation be-twi-rn I’eie and Tilda—wenl and sat on a log outside the calim Small trace of the wild-cat in the girl, through all llim Ion; spring evening, as she confidingly leaned her head on her lover’s shoulder.
The mooa came up bright at ten, and about eleven Pete row lo take his departure. He gave Tilda a hearty smack on ihe lips, bid her good night, and took three steps in tbe moonlight toward the road, when—bang! came the report ' of a shot-gun from the bush, a hundred feet or so from him, and wiib a terrible moon the German lad wont down in the .yellow dust—deuu, a half-dozen buck-shot in his brain.
CHAPTER XL.
THAT DOOBLE-nABRELKD QUlf,
Th» mun’.er of Pete created quite a little ripple of excite •Sent In Smithville and the neighborhood.
. Tbs qnict German lad was generally liked, and as there irks' fl<T possible reason why any ons should kill him, as he had never quarreled with a single soul since he haS come to Bfiiiihvllte. men ytgin to look askance at each other, and mutter that It waa aoout time that this sort of thing was put down.
There was very little doubt as to the man who had lain JlL_gniL-far_E&ta. although no one had Been who fired
lieutenant and ten boys in blue rode Into SraUhvnie, wtt orders to bunt dewn the outlaw.
Some three days after the murder of Pete, a negro cam# to the lieutenent and informed him that Ozark had taken refuge at the house of s distant relative of his. about two miles beyond the county seat on the East r^ad Trls negro’s brother had been killed by the outlaw for daring to vote at e town election, and naturally the black thirsted for rgvengo.
The soldiers and the negro set out.
They arrived at the county seat, passed through It—mud to the wonder of the inhabitants—and rode down the East road, then, dashing up to the log-cabin, surrounded it In s most masterly mauner. But the disgust of the lieutenant Ix command was intense when he discovered that the outlaw was not in tbe cabin.
The woman whom the soldiers found In tho shanty made no secret of the fact that the outlaw had been there, but said he had gone away on a mule.
Disappointed, the lieutenant resumed his saddle and set out at the head of his men to return to the county seat, aa he fully realized that there was little use of hunting after th* ruffian, who had. in all probability, received a warning of their coming and bad sought refuge in the swamp.
The soldiers rode slowly along the road on their homeward way, and the negro beguiled tbe tediousness of the journey l>y relating some of the outlaw’s desperate and bloody deeds
Then the negro happened to turn his head and glance behind him, and a yell ot terror came from his lips.
"Oh. Lord! dar he is now!"
Bang! The double-barrel spoke, and a load of tore through the arm of the rearmost soldier.
Mounted on his gray mule, the outlaw—learning that tin troops had been at the cabin after him—had pursued them to give battle.
Bang! went the other barrel.
A horse got it ttys time, the charge falling
Tbe soldiers had just given one glance at t man, mounted on tbe.mule, and then had into their horses’ flanks and fled in wild coi waiting to return a shot Twelve men—ten Boldiers—“ stampeded " by one!
The soldiers rode into the county seat and took possession of the court-house, intending to use that as a base of operations.
In llieir flight they had completely run away from the outlaw; but% judge of their surprise, when a negro came in with tbe intelligence that Ozark had followed them into town, and was now domiciled at the saloon down the street, enjoying a bottle of whisky and a box of sardines, and waltzing for the Boldiers to attack him.
Just about this lime it occurred to the lieutenant in com-mund of the party that to beat the outlaw in a horse-race was not exactly what he had been sent to do; and nettled a’ the reckless bravado of the outlaw, also feeling & littlr ashamed of his own conduct so far In the affair, the able and intelligent officer—history has not preserved bis name— moxintai his men to attack Ozark, who was Intrenched in a saloon upon the ground floor, watching through the window and the glass door for the approach of the attacking force.
Tbe soldiers came up first at a smart trot, then slackened little by little into a walk.
The moment they came within range, the outlaw coolly and deliberately leveled the shot-gun and put a charge of buck shot into the breast of the sergeant on the right, killing him mstaj.tly; tbe soldier next to the sergeant got the second barrel in the right shoulder, putting hire completely out of fighting trim.
The lieutenant gave the word to Are, and the soldier*— nervous at the bloody effect of the outlaw’s fire—poured an irregular and scattering volley into the shanly, and then, urged on by their officer, who was eager to retrieve hi* blunders, dashed toward the saloon.
Ozark, who had received a ball In the fleshy part of hi* left arm, but had sustained no other damage from tbe soldiers’ fire, seized his revolvers and poured six shots, one after the other, as fast as- he could fire, into the charging troops.
One of the foremost men was killed outright, two morw were slightly wounded, and the attacking column suddenly broke, seized by a panic, wheeled their horses round and la-gloriously fled back to their former quarters in the court-liou*e, leaving llieir dead and wounded comrade* on tho field of bat-
whisky sad another box of sardines, and waited for the next jiove on the part of the Federate.
Twenty, thirty minutes passed and no soldiers appeared. Ozark got impatient. Be learned from one of the citizens that the troops were still in the court-house; bo he sat down, wrote s note, snd dispatched it by a negro to the lieutenant in command of the Foderal squad.
That gentleman was sorely cut up by his defeat; he had trd five men out of ten, three killed and two wounded, and what to do he knew not. If he had not succeeded in storming the enemy's position with ten men, how could he hope Jar a successful issue now that he had only five!
While deliberating over, this grave question, the outlaw's messenger arrived and delivered his note. The lieutenant wa» somewhat astonished.
The note was addressed:
“ To the Cbmmander-in-ehief of 0* United 8taiet fonset holding the enurUunm of Franklin.”
The lieutenant opened it; the note was extremely brief and very much to the point; it read as follows:
" 8th:—1 hereby demand the unconditional surrender of ronreelf and force within ten minutes, or I propose to move immediately upon your works.
“ (Signed)	Yell Ozark,
“ Msjor General C. 8. A_,
“ Commanding Army of Franklin.”
It was i grim and ghastly joke.
Th. Federal soldiers did not wait for the ten minutes to expire. Inside of five they were in the saddle and in full retreat for Smithville, leaving the outlaw master at the field!*
CHAPTER X LI.
A BOLD BTKP.
Which Texas went in to breakfast, on tbe mc-nlng after
ihe Ku Klux attack, be noticed that Missouri seemed strangely 'eaerved. It was evident that the youn£ girl had something » her mind. The overseer guessed at once that the Genera] bad acquainted her witb the proposition that old Fayette, th* banker, had made, and he looked at Missouri's face with a {real deal of curiosity, as if he expected to teai mere the answer that she would give.
If Missouri'!, face was any indication of her thoughts regarding the matter, she was not particularly pleased with tbe idea, and the overseer felt in quite high spirits as he noticed how grave was the expression upon the features of the giri.
As for the lady, she had stolen a quiet glance at the overseer, after he had got fairly at work upon the eatables before bim, and the look of cectentment which appeared upon his face did not seem to please her in the least.
It was not a very lively group, at the break fast mbit., that tnorming. Missouri was sad, the overseer quiet, and the General strangely absent-minded.
The meal was over at last, much to the relief of both father and daughter, but Texas never seemed to notice the abstraction of the others.
The General and tbe overseer departed at once to set the bands to work. Smith did not mention the subject of bis daughter's marriage with young Fayette, and the overseer on bis part refrained from questioning.
Tbe hour of. twelve came, and the two returned to the house for dinner.
Missouri annomiued that it would not be ready for half an hour, at which the General remarked that it would give him time to write a letter to Memphis in relation to the insurance matter; so he went into tbe house, leaving Texas standing on the steps of the piazza, and Missouri just in the doorway.
Missouri hesitated irresolutely in the doorway for a moment, and then, as if seeming to make up her mind suddenly, stepped out on the piazza, and leaning on the railing, addressed the man, three steps below:
•• Mr. Texas, will you give me a little advice!” she asked, abruptly, her voice low but firm.
The overseer was considerably astonished at this question. Fox about the first time since Missouri had known him he betrayed traces of embarrassment.
*• Of course, Miss, I shall be most happy to do so, if I can,” he replied, earnestly.
“ You are the only one that I can ask, and I am about to speak to yon as if vou were mv brother. ”
* Th. above ta bo rom&oce, gen Lie ruder, but hUtory. An j oflloer •f th. lttn Infantry, D. 8. A.—th. ndiuDt .rationed ln. Arkanaas la slxt7-«ltkt and nine—Major WttherJX of Eaatport.

" And 111 try, Miss, to give you a ‘brother’s •drto*R Texas exclaimed, abruptly, snd he advanced one step uy; nearer to the girl.
The color In Missouri’s face hightened just a Utile at the movement, but she stuck resolutely to her position
“ I should perhaps not have dared to have spoken to you: but that 1 |now father has told you all about it I overheard tbe conversation between yon and father last night on the piazza. I could not help hearing it, for my room is right overhead, and I was sitting at tho window when he began, and father always speaks so loud. 1 suppose he gov into that habit in the army. Now, Mr. Texas, I haven*! any one else to advise me, so I ask you. Father said to do just as I liked; he would not advise me either one way or ths other. I must make my own choice.”
“ W-Jl, Miss, I really don’t know as I am quite the proper sort of persoa to advise you in such a matter aa this," hs answered, thoughtfully. “ Mr. Fayette 1 have never met, personally, but from what I have heard of him I should judge that he’d make a pretty good match for almost any young lady. I've heard it said that he is one of the rising men of the Slate, and as he has both ability and moaey to back it, there’s no telling how high he may climb before he gets through. ”
A look of impatience mingled with vexation passed swiftly across the maiden’s face.
“ You think that it is a good match?” she asked, ln quil» a sorrowful tone.
'* Yes, Miss, it’s my honest opinion that It la.”
“ Then it doesn’t make any difference whether I care any thing about him or not?” demanded the girl, imperiously, her eyes Bashing and her lips trembling. “ I must sell my. self to him because he has money and I am poor—woreI than poor—a beggar, by father’s account. I must marry i man that I know I don’t love.”
" You didn't say any thing about that,” the overseer retorted. bluntly. “ You asked me if I thought that it was i good match.”
“ And you do not think I ought to marry him unless I love him?” the girl said, slowly.
“Of course I don’t!” Texaa replied, promptly; “ a marriage without love is but an earthly contract, and can never receive Ilesven’s sanction."
Th“ girl opened her eyes widely at this speech. She had never heard the overseer express himself in such a manner before.
“ I suppose thut fmher will have to give up the planta ; tion. though.” she said, reflectively, " and then you will lose] your situation.” And. as she spoke, she shot a quick glanc*' under her long, dark eyelashes at the face before her.
“ I reckon that if tbe General makes up his mind to emigrate, he’ll give me a chance to go along with him. Miss,"! the overseer said, cheerfully. “I sha’n’t quarrel about ths wages, and with a fresh start on new ground, ’tis ten to ons that your father will be able to hold bis own with the world
I	wish 1 had a few thousand dollars P’
“ What would you do witb the money ?" sheaskod, slowly
“ Speculate on it," be replied, tersely.
11	Speculate—how?" she asked.
“ bend it to your father—without conditions, snd depend J npon gratitude to give me the treasure which money should > not buy.”
Missouri's face grew red as Ore; then, with a great effort, : ihe looked the overseer full in the face; the full, black eyes were now soft and lustrous in their light.
“ I am glad you haven’t got a thousand dollars,” she said slowly, “ even though it migbt save the plantation; but—’’ ;
" But what?” asked Texas, quite eagerly, taking her iittlt'i right hand between his own brown paws as he spoke.
“ I do not think I could like the man who only lends mf, father money half as well as the one who saved my life," thf; girl replied, with a charming smile.
"Dinner, Missy!” exclaimed Butterfly, from the house door, interrupting the conversation.
But, enough had been said; eyes had spoken if lips had not, and two vary happy people sat dowa to dinner under General Smith's roof, that day.
What was money weighed 'gainst love ln a young girl’s mind?
CHAPTER XLI I.
MANY THINGS.
In tbe coed of the evening Foxcroft and Fayette were walking along carelessly down by tbe levee of Smithville, ••urn-tttly engaged in conversation. TeU Ozark and bis latcm (doits formed the topic of conversation between the two. foxcroft was seriously uneasy; he trembled lest the outlaw should be captured and reveal the influential friends who had sitherto aided him.
Fayette laughed at the idea.
■' Don’t worry about thatl" be exclaimed. " Whatever Ozark’s faults may be, treachery is not one of them. Not to save Ms neck from the rope would he betray us.”
" Men will do a great many things when in a tight place," Foxcroft replied, dubiously. A coward at heart himself, be judged all tbe rest of mankind by his standard.
" There is not the slightest danger. The chances, too, are V hundred to one that Ozark will not be taken aJivu And sow, Foxcroft, I want you to do me a favor,” Fayette said.
*■ Certainly; what is it?” and the fat storekeeper looked just a little bit astonished.
"You remember that Ozark and myself went in search of a box that was hidden in an old cabin, by the edge of ike swamp f”
•' Yes; do you know that I forgot all about it?" Foxcroft •xdaimed " How did you make out?”
L " We found the box without any trouble, but it only contained a few scraps of paper."
“ Ob, I see; the overseer got there before you and secured Whatever the box contained”
fr " No, you are wrong there," Fayette rejoined, “ for Ozark -and myself hid in the swamp until the morning and saw the '■sverseer and the old negro come to the cabin.”
“ Who do you suppose got at the box ?’ demanded Foxcroft, ^evidently astonished
Bf. •• I think that the old negro knows something about it,”
I	Fayette replied, thoughtfully. “ The box only contained a paper which alone concerned the overseer, Ozark and myself. In fact, that statement in part is only guesswork, and it may •«ot concern Ozark and myself at all. Now, I wish that you Nrould call upon old Uncle Snow and see if you can either eoax or frighten the old darky into telling whether he did riampcr with the box or not,”
' “ 1 con find out easily enough," Foxcroft said, confidently.
•' “ I can pretend that I met this Jupiter who left the box and . that he told me all about iL Let us turn back and I’ll go
10	the shanty at once.”
The two turned and commenced to retrace their steps, t*. “By the way, how does the Smith affair come on?" Fox-
■	iroft asked.
“ " The young lady declines, and I shall have to put old Smith through a course of sprouts," Fayette answered, moodily " There's a chance for you to speculate if you iraol to buy a plantation cheap. 1 shall bring it uodei the hammer an soon as the law will let me."
“ I'll ihiuk about it."	•
As the two passed through the main street of the village the overseer rode by them.
Texas evidently had just come from the plantation. As he rode (low u the street, he met Winnie and Adair coming up.
All three halted and exchanged salutations; then Gol Adaii Irew off a little to one side, leaving the two friends together. S’ " Where are you bound?" Winnie asked.
£ " Running a fox to earth,” the overseer replied, carelessly, p' <• Well. I’m going to do a little in that line myself,” the Soldie. said, with a laugh; “ but, what fox are you after?" 5? Dr you remember what I told you about my father?"
** Tes; he was killed In this neighborhood, and you came after a paper on which he had written the name of his mur-
: flerer.’
Exactly; well, I found that the paper was concealed In g* tin tobacoo-box, and the box hidden in an old shanty. I ~5feat to the place, got the box, and on opening It found that ‘Sickly contained the scraps of a letter.” jjjfc ** Some one had been there before you?”
E/'Yee," Texas replied, "and had taken away what I I'WUght, and left other scraps of paper, evidenUy thinking to £prow me off the track."
IT What did youwteT Winnie asked, his curiosity excited Pasted the letter-ecraps together, and so got a clue to the / ■arty .that had taken the documents I wanted. ”
IS*'" And you are after the party now?”
R"T» I called it the house on my way up and found that jkfee man way la tovrn."
“ WeH, good tuek to you; though betweea you and sm, Frtnk, I should never have thought that you WOUld b» lleve In this South-western notion of personal vengeance.”
“ Neither do I,” Texas replied, slowly, “ but I own I have
•	strange curiosity to discover who it is that has taken a* much pains to baffle my search. But where are you bound?"
“ After Ozark,” replied Winnie, with a side glance at Qol Adair, who seemed buried in abstraction. “ I have telegraphed to General Smith, at Little Bock, for permission to •ike command of the detachment here and pursue this out. law. You heard about tbe killing of the Dutch boy, Peter *■ .1 as ho put the question, Winnie sunk his voice almost t* a whisper so that Adair should not hear him.
.. Tet.”
•• Adair here lovod that boy as If he bad been Us own sob. He has hardly eaten anything since the night when we found Pete in the road, stone-dead, with Ozark’s buck-shots in Ui brain. Ozark is gone up now, sure, for the old man Is ar well acquainted with the swamps aa he is, and heU run him night and day till he squares the account"
“ There’s my man I” exclaimed the overseer, suddenly, as Judge Yell rode down the street “ Til see you again!" And then Texas spurred off to intercept the old Judge.
At nine o'clock that night the telegraph dispatch came from Little Bock, authorizing Winnie to take command of the detachment of soldiers whom the outlaw had bo handsomely whipped, and at ten, Winnie and Gol Adair, with the five soldiers at their heels, were on their way to arrest the desperado.
At three o'clock on the next afternoon the detachment suddenly came, upon the outlaw on the East road, s mile or so the other side of the county seat
A fight ensued, the result of which was one soldier badly wounded, Ozark dismounted from his mule in hot haste by Gol Adair Bending a rifle-ball “ plum " through the brute, and forced to take refuge In the swamp by the side of ths road, leaving his terrible double-barrel gun as trophy of victory to the conquerors.
*' Leave him to me!” cried Gol Adair, as he swung him. self out of tbe saddle, and, ramming down a charge into Us rifle, prepared to follow TTre~ fugitive, “ One Is as good as twenty In this hyer slush. I'll fotch him I” and the old hunter dashed into the wilderness, leaving the soldiers to r*-turn and tell the story of their victory.
OHAPTEB XLIII.
AT LAHTI
Tbxas rode up to the Judge who was mounted on a mule.
" Good-evening, Judge, the overseer said.
“ Ah. good-evening, Mr Texas,” tbe Judge remarked, bowing in his usual stately and dignified manner.
" I found a letter belonging to yon out near my place." Texas drew the letter from his pocket as he spoke He had matched the torn Bcraps together and pasted them on a thin piece of -paper.
By the aid of the light which streamed from the window •f the saloon near by the Judge examined the letter.
It was simply a note from Bob Howard requesting the Judge to call at his office when he came Into town.
The Judge looked puzzled.
" I don't remember ever seeing this,” he said, thoughfulty. '• I got a verbal message of tbe same import as this from Howard tbe other day, but I am certain I never received this note "
"Then Howard must have lost it,” Texaa observed. " I have a strange curiosity to find out where it did come from. Much obliged, Judge; i'll go after Howard right away.”
The overseer proceeded to ride off, and the Judge called out after him:
“ You’ll And Bob at the General Lee saloon."
Thither tne overseer proceeded, and there, a* the Judgs had said, he found tbe young lawyer.
Howard remembered the note Instantly.
*' Oh, yea, I wrote that"
44 And did you send it to the Judger
•• Of course.”
" Why, he told me Just now that he never received It"
" The deuce he did!" exclaimed Howard, in astonishment.
“Yes; he seemed quite positive about it He said, though, that he remembered receiving a verbal message from you upon tbe same subject ”
" Ch, yea, * remember all about it now!” Howard es.
claimed, abruptly. . " After I wrote tho note and got one of the young nigs to carry it, it suddenly occurred to me that the boy might lose it on tho way, so I told him what the contents were. I see; the boy told the Judge I wanted to see him, and did not deliver the note at all.”
The overseer bej-an *0 despair; tbe clue seemed to be no elite at aU
■' The boy probably put the note in his pocket,” Howard continued, " and then threw it sway sometime when be was out by your place. It was that young imp, Jim Crow.”
And then a sudden light flashed upon the bewildered brain of tht overseer.
Jun Crow was tbe grandson of old Uncle Bnowl He had been asleep In the upper story of Snow’s house on the niglu when the old negro bad revealed where the box was concealed. What was more probable than that he had over heard the conversation, and had robbed the bos of its contents!
“ Much obliged, Mr. Howard,” said the overseer, abruptly, and then he rode rapidly away, leaving Howard in a stair of considerable astonishment
Straight to the house of tbe old negro, Texas rode.
The door of the shanty was open and Texas rode up; be saw that both the old man and his grandson were within.
Springing from his horse the overseer strode abruptly into the cabin. Drawing a revolver from his belt, be cocked It and leveled the shining tube full at the head of the young black, who no sooner beheld the menace than he went down ttpon his knees in an agony of terror.
‘‘Yon young whelp, tell me what -you did with the paper that yon stole from the tin box or I’U drill a hole through your black head I” the overseer cried sternly.
“ Don’t shoot, massa!” howled the boy, in abject terror; u 'ion de Lord, I’U done tell you ail ’bout it!”
“ Where is itf" And as Texas spoke he thrust the cold mnzxlo of the pistol against the hoy’s temple.
“ Dp-sta'rs, hid in de rufl," cried the boy, with a howL
11	Set it immediately I"
Jim Crow did not wait for a second command but scrambled up the ladder in a dreadful taurry; in a moment he was back with a folded paper, yellow with age.
The boy, with the cunning of his race, had overheard the conversation between his grandfather and the while stranger relative to the box, as already recorded, and falling into the error that there was either money or jewels concciled in it, had stolen forth to possess himself of the treasure, but finding only a written paper in the box, be had taken possession of it—with what motive he could hardly have told himself, except that he thought it must be of value to tome one. and that, at some future time, he might be able to dispose of it. Happening to have Howard's note in his pocket, be bad tom it kuio pieces, and placed them in the box, thinking that one papor was as good as another. Then, with the natural desire 10 impress Payette and Foxcroft with the belief that it wu valuable to them, he bad told of tbe hidden box, knowing, U/O, that it only contained a few worthless scrape of paper.
But the revolver of the overseer; and the abrupt accusa-tion. had been too much for him, and in his fright he had yielded uj> his ill-gotten treasure.
The ovttseer put it at once into his pocket without examination
“ Uncle Snow, this young imp will stretch a rope one O-these days if he isn't careful,” Texas said, dryly; then he retroated from the house, mounted his horse and rode off toward the Smith plantation And there, in the silence of his own room, he examined the yellow document that for so many yean had been buried from the light.
An expression of profound astonishment appeared upon the face of the overseer as he ascertained the nature of the legal paper which was spread out on the little table before
fatm
•' Well, of all the strange chances in the world!” he mut tered, after he had carefully perused the paper. Then he turned it over and examined the back of it. Three short line* traced in a strange-colored ink, now almost faded out, and a signature beneath. Not one man out of a thousand would have guessed that the faint-hued ink was of human blood
The signature was bold and strong.
, 41 John Cooper, Captain, 8d Texas, C. S. A"
Three times, at least, the overseer read the almost illegible wards over, and then he took up s pen and with a firm h(u>d JaUberatebr blotted trn the faint lines.
“ There,” he n?virmured," after he had finished and ha ssl
contemplating liis work; “ the secret is mine and bis. Itfl not possible that he can guess or even suspcct that any m In the world except himself knows aught of the past.” J Then the overaeer got up, folded tho paper carefully u| put it in a secret pocket in the breast of his flannel nnrteflj shin.
WUl Fayette had little idea of the impending new.
CHAPTER XLIV.
“ solid chunks of wisdom.*
Dat after day passed The legal notice that the motfj gage would be foreclosed had been given, and Smith hsi vainly endeavored to get enough money together to meet thl demand. But eveiything went wrong. The insurance conk pany upon whom he had depended, had become involved^ more difficulties, and it was thought that it would be fu3y * year before their affairs would be settled so that they couUj declare a dividend.
The General fussed and worried, but Missouri seemed strangely contented, and the overseer would every now s&d then, in a placid manner, tell the General to take it easy sad trust to some fortunate accident to see him through.
Tbe Fayettes, father and'son, had made up their minds to force payment. Missouri's refusal had produced the aati-cipated result
Silting in their office, they had discussed tbe affair in sti its bearings, and the son had just observed that the plants* tion would go for a mere song, when Sheriff Johnson came ioj “ Good mornin'," Johnson said, as he stuck his head in at the door; “ have you heerd the newsf”
“What news*" Will Fayette asked, carelessly.
“ ’Bout Gineral Sm'—”
“ No; what about Smithf”
“ Why, they're goin' fur to seize his plantation P This astounding intelligence brought young Fayette to his feet at once.	^
“ Who's going to seize his plantation?” he asked, hardly able to believe his hearing.
“ I don’t know ’bout that,” Johnson said, doubtfully; “some creditor, 1 reckon."
“ Well, I think they will have some trouble to get over our mortgage." young Fayette remarked, incredulously.
“ I don’t know how that will work,” Johnson observed, with an air of profound wisdom, “I boerd old'Judge YelJ say that the place was gwine up, for sure; an’ I rockoo what the Judge don't know 'bout the law ain’t worth know ing. ”
“ Where Is the Judge?” the elder Fayette asked “ Over to Bob Howard’s office.”
" You had better go over and see what there is in this r» port," old Fayette said, addressing his son.
Fayette seized his hat and departed at once, while thi sherifl procecdetf to carry the startling intelligence to othei quarters.
Faycttt fonnd the old Judge busily engaged In writing Is Howaid’s office.
“ Good-morning, Judge. What is this report about some one seizing General Smith’s placet” Fayette questioned, abruptly.
“ Good morning, Mr. Fayette,” returned the old Judge; blandly. “ The report is quite correct I am retained foi the plaintiff.”
" But, Judge, yon must be aware that my father and my self hold's mortgage on the place. You can't get over vhatl" Fayette exclaimed, just a little hotly.
My dear sir, we don’t propose to get over It,” replied the Judge, caressing his double chin with his fat, white band, and smiling beamingly upon Fayette. “ It to for yeut mortgage to get over our bill of sale."
“A bill of sale given before our mortgagef" exclaimed Fayette, in astonishment and alarm.
“Exactly; we propose to tum General Smith out; w* have nothing to do with your mortgage atoll; you can't ho 14 my client, Mr. Francis Cooper, nor his property, for any ad of Gegera) Smith. In fact, to speak quite plainly, Mr. Fayette, as far as the plantation of Plney-wood Is concerned, your mortgage lan’t worth the paper it Is written on.”
“ Judge, if It Is not asking too much. I should like t* know what claim this Francis Cooper has on General Smith’s plantation f”
“ Certainly," the old Judge replied, with extreme dignity
The Man from Texas.
'•T shall he plewSfl to' give yon all the information ln my rpfSer TlrffuW is, >tr. FHyettc, our case 1s so strong that .Kt! f.:u\ nJIord to be very (rank in regard to it I have sent \o OimicthI Smith a full >.t»U-ment l>f llic whole affair, and I ♦spert him in town eveiy minute. Between us, Mr. Payette, ■Ueii'-rnl Smith- will not contest the case, but will give us peaciitlde possession; I aa wire of it, because he hasn’t got t leg to stand on, legally. Here is the document on which ye bane our claim.”
Judge Tell unfolded a paper, yellow with age, and held £ op for Payette’s inspection.
It was a regular bill of sale o* Smith's entire plantation to John Cooper, of 8an Antonio. Texas, for the sum of ton thousand dollars, dated 10th of May, 1868.
■" You will observe that is witnessed by Captain Ken ford ■Hid Major Crockett, both of wliom are now liviug near I.it-jle Rock, and can be brought forward to testify regarding it; besides. General Smith will not attempt to deny his ugna-'iare,” Yoll said.
Fayette was like a man stunned by thi. overwhelming tes-Simony.
" But this deed is to John Cooporl” he fta.d, slowly
11	Quite correct,” romarkwi the old lawyer; “ (japtatn John Sooper, of the Third Texas regiment, died here at gmithville « short time after he received this deed. His son, Francis hooper, now claims it, as his father's heir. There Might be , Uttle doubtful point then, the identity of the said Francis Cooper; but, iTOkilv, Lieutenant Winnie, now here, was acquainted with both father and son. and can testify as to »fmt You see, Mr. Fayette, how strong the case is. By ihe way, you must know Mr. Cooper. He’s now acting as Geicral Smith's overseer—Francis Texas; Texas is his mid-<Ue name. ”
And then, aa the old lawyer folded up the yellow paper, layette caught sight of the blotted lines upon the back. In an Instant .he truth dashed upon him.
£..•* Tkii was the paper that had been concealed In the tin to-r$SCC0-tX>X!
; .The overseer was not Ihe son of the Texan drover. Con-science, “which doth make towards of us all,” had tricked ^llDth Fayette and the outlaw Into the belief that it was for Athens tho avenger searched; and now, lo and behold 1 they i*d cnly yielded to a phantom fear.
.' Fayette sat and pondered over tbe situation for a few minutes in silence.
£' ‘ It seems, then, that General Smith has really had no legs!1 claim to his plantation since sixty three,” he said, at fkugth.
•>', That deduction Is quite correct,” Judge Yell replied. "By* series of peculiar accidents, this deed has been kept back, but that does not Impair the legality of it. Wo are jftnwred to prove, by the witnesses, whose signatures are attached to this document, that the sale was Kna fid*, and the ijSosidcratlon given and received. Of course you are aware tfi&tthe law does not hold that a deed must be recorded, although for safety It Is generally done.”
“It Is very strange that General Smith has kept the existence of this d«td a secret, and used the estate precisely as ifrit had not existed,” Fayette observed, with an angry look upon his face.
i,;;“lly dear Mr. Payette, I can assure you that my honored Mend, Genera) Smith, had no knowledge of the existence of i legal document,” and the old lawyer laid particular stress Upon the 'honored friend.” “I feel perfectly sure, M>. lfW«tte, that you would be the last person in the world to :M(gest that General Leonidas W. Smith, the sole descendant Iti tbe illustrious Smith, who from the howling wilderness .reclaimed the broad acres of our infant metropolis here, j*Wlld perform any act that a high-toned gentleman would Hftttln question Bring the case home to yourself. Mr. Fay-IS^t.r From the force of circumstances. General Smi .li parted ancestral acres; then went forth to battle with the iSm invaders Returning from the gory fields of war, jBtt'the Roman of old, prepared to transform the weapon of fWMgs into tbe peaceful implement of agriculture, he found B^tsll the world still considered him the owner of Piucy-jwaj that Captain John Cooper and the deed of sixty-throe HpjtW’Wf intentut / Captain Cooper had never taken any P»10 establish his claim to the estate The chances were deed was destroyed.

Mr. Payette, that not once to a “hundred JSsrs’ Is It poesIM) that a deed of this sort could; be brought forward after ths death of the grantee, and a 6trong legal cl^im set up to oust the holder. But la this case, we are prepared to prove everything; the sale, the death-of Mr. Cooper, the Identity of the heir, and the genuineness of the deed.”
“ Tbe only. thing left for us is to bring an action against Smith to recover,” Fayotto said, moodily, “ although I think that we can trouble your client’s claim if we choose to con
“ Doubtful, unless you can prove collusion between Gea-emi Smith and Captain Cooper in regard to the deed of sale; but, as we can establish thnt Captain Cooper died Immedi-alter receiving the deed, and that by a chapter of accidents, it has been kept from the hands of his heir until now, and that the moment it came into the possession at said heir, he commenced legal proceedings immediately, to oust Smith, you see how extremely desperate that course of action would be. You will perceive that I speak with extreme frankness. I am too old a lawyer not to know the folly of unnecessary litigation.”
•' The only course left for us, then, is to sue Smith, and seize the stock, tools, etc,” Fayette said, alcwly.
“ You can't do that, very weU,” the Judge remarked, smiling as blandly as usual
•' Why not’” demanded Fayette, in extreme ill-temper? “ this deed doesh’t cover tbe slock and tools, dses itf
“ No, but we have a certain claim for back rent since sixty-three, and as -I had an idea that some c*editor of 3mith might have recourse upon the stock, etc., I took advantage of the General's openly expressed intention to emigrate, U get out a writ of ne exeai and attach all his valuables upon oath that he was about to fly from tiie State with intent to defraud his creditors. And, Mr. Fayette, if you can find five dollars’ worth of property belonging to General Smith that my attachments don’t cover, I will be willing JU •acknowledge that I don’t know as much about the 1&U* SS I think I do.”	■„
And then the old Judge laid back in the arm-chair, rnrswKtfl his chin and smiled beamingly upon Fayette
That gentlen.&A IM ix a rags. He was rullv conscious .hat he was no match for tbe old Judge.
“We shall fight the affair, Judge,” he exclaimed. “I shall see Mr. Howard at once i-nd instruct him to take the neccssary steps.”
“ Vou can’t get Boh Howard,” the Judge said; "he's retained on ouf side.”	* " Than I shai! take Colonel Chase.”
"Nor Colonel Chase, either; nor lawyer Warner; nor any other lawyer short of Fort Smith or Little Rock. I’ve retained *.vt»ry legal gentlemt.n in Franklin count? on my side,” the Judge said, quietly. “ If you really want a lawsuit wo are prepared to give it to you, red-hot, to use that common but forcible expression.’’
Fayette looked at the Judge in disgust, but with an effort ho curbed down the rage that was swelling in his heart “Judge, I don’t want to act hastily in this matter,” he said, slowly, " hut four thousand dollars and upwards is no Joke to lose. Does yourclient propose to make any arrangement with regard to the mortgage?”
“ Mr. Fayette, now you are uttering solid chocks of wisdom,” said the Judge. " My client does propose to help /ou out of the difllculty. He fully understands that for you 10 proceed against General 8mith, as he Is situated at present. would be only to exemplify the trite adage so familiar to the disciples of Coke and Blackstone, of ' suing a beggar and catching ’—tbe insect whose name is not to be mentioned to ears polite. But, to come directly to business On condition of your fatbor and yourself relinquishing all Claim upon General Smith, Mr. Francis Cooper will draw you three notes for one thousand dollars apiece, payable la three, six and nine months, bearing ten per cent interest ’’
" That puts us In for over a thousand dollars,” Fayette remarked, thoughtfully, pondering over the matter.
" Well, count the cost of a law-suit with an almost cor tainty that you will be beaten in the end,” the Judge said, a very placid and contented expression upon his face.
“ I will see my father and talk the matter over with him," Fuvt-1 \r obwrrM. as ho advanced to tbo door.
'■ Do so, give my respects to him by the way,” Yell said, returning t.> his writing
The two Favettes discussed the matter. The Judge’s statements produced the proper impression, and the result was that tk* overseer's ofler was accepted and Smith breathed free

O	Missouri's astonishment she notioed that a very strange eoldnees seemed to have appeared hi her father’s manner toward the overseer, since that gentleman had anaounccd who and what he was.
Through Judge YeU, Texas had communicated to the General his desire that he—the General—an‘d his daughter should consider the plantation as their home, and hinted that, at some future day, an arrangement might be made in regard to running the place on shares, as he—the overseer— professed his inability to handle the place alone.
But the General, though affected almost to tears by the offer, and the thought of how The Man-from-Texas had lifted all his liabilities and taken them upon his own shoulders, flbooX his head sadly, wrung the old Judge’s hand impressively, remarked, with extreme earnestness, that he wished he was in heaven or the other place, and stalked away; but he gave no sign of the manner in which he regarded the overseer’s offer.
Three days had passed since the necessary legal settlement had been made, and during that time the General had seemed *o avoid the company of the overseer as much as possible. Texas, though, never seemed to notice it, and attended to the duties appertaining to the plantation as usual.
On the evening of the third day, just before supper, the overseer was in the store-house, taking account of the stock of feed on hand, when General Bmith, gloomy and melancholy, stalked into tlie cabin and carelessly closed the door behind him. The overseer figuring away by the light of a tallow candle, looked up in astonishment.
“Mr. Cooper, I can’t stand this any longerf” exclaimed tbe General abruptly.
**0an*l stand what. General?” asked the overseer.
44 F'can’t stay here under the roof that belongs to you, fir, and eat your bread, with this dreadful secret preying upon my brain? I shall go mad, sir I I feel that my brain U giving way, and I am such a poor, miserable coward, sir. that I have feared to come to you and make the confession which I ought to make. The first morsel of your bread, sir, which I put into my mouth ought to have choked me, but, there doesn't seem to be such a thing as justice on this earth. Every night since I knew who you really was, I have prsyed that Heaven might call me to a reckoning before the morning came, but each morning I have awoke as well in health as ever, although sorely distracted in mind. Francis Cooper, instead of coming forward like s guardian angel and saving me and ray child from being turned into the world tike the beggars that we are, you ought to take your revolver, sir, and lodge the contents in my guilty heart. But, sir, I can not bear the load any longer, and I have come to make a full confession.n
The avefeeer listened very attentively to the trembling emuU of the old soldier, btfi tbe mom eat had flnlehe*.
“ General Smith, I know all about H," lie said, qpfatly^
" and all I ask is for you to tell me the particular*. Did Otyp father fall in a Wei?”
“ Yes; Bhot dead by my handl" exclaimed *5ie General, excitedly. “ We had been gambling heavily together for e week or so; the night before we met t had lost to him at thi card-table almost every thing that I had in4the world. Had even sold this plantation to him, that I might have money to stake. We quarreled over the-cards; from words we came to blows; after that, as men whose honor was at Btake, » duel was the only issue. We arranged to fight wiihoul seconds; we met in the morning, and at tho first fire he felL
1	ran to his side, but he was apparently dead. I hurried at once for assistance, but, when 1 returned, the body had dia appeared. Now, Mr. Cooper, I am at your mercy. I know that I owe you satisfaction, for blood demands blood. I know that 1 speak like a coward when I say that I can not raise my hand against a man who has acted so nobly as you have, but I am willing to stand and receive your fire—or, if you will but say the word, I will put the muZfcle of your re* ▼olver to my head and pull the trigger with my own hand."
“ General Smith, though a Southern man, I don’t believe Ln the ‘code of honor,’ nor in the doctrine of blood for blood,H Texas said, slowly. “ My father fell by your handr in fair fight; it is not for me to seek your blood, but 1 wii make one demand; I will speak like the Spanish daughter who claimed vengeance of Cid*, ' he has slain, my father, IpI him take me for wife and so replace him/ Give me Missouri r
Little need to state the answer of the General; who could fail to guess it?
The-Man-from-Texas won the Wack-eyed beauty—and pretty Missouri soon became Mrs. Francis Cooper.
Aiter Yell Oaark’s disappearance in the swamp, with “ Qol, the Swapper,” in full chase, nothing more was heard of him, until, about a week later, some negroes, after 'coon on a moonlight night by the borders of Black-Jack Swamp, came upon the body of the outlaw, extended at full length on the^ ground close by a tall cottonwood. The hand of the desper-Silo lay upon a revolver, showing that he died like a wHd-cafc at bay. A single bullet-bole through the head betrayed the: couree of the ball of Gol Adair, who had tracked the outlaw by day and by night, until at last, hunted down, Jiark had turned and given buttle.
