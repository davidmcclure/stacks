'• Omaha, the Friendly P “Here.”
“All are present.” said the leader of the party, Fred Travis.
In tact it was unnecessary to call the roll to apprise that little band that hot oik- of its members was absent. But It was done in observance of a code of regulations which they had adopted before sotting out upon the trail All were young men, none being over tliree-and-twonty years of age, and two or three somewhat younger, but all. like true sons of the border, were possessed of hardihood and strength, and their hearts were burning with a terrible fire of revenge.
Each one carried a rifle, a side tomahawk and hunting-knife. while from the bosom of their hnhting-sbirte |>eepod the polished pistol-butts.
They stood beneath the umbrageous covering of an oak, each leading upon his riflo, and waiting the orders of his leader; but, ere those orders breaking up their night’s bivouac benoath the great oak tree, there suddenly came the sharp report of a rifle, followed by a low cry— the unmistakable death-wail.
The Bight Avengers gazed from one to the other with inquiring glances.
“ Without a doubt another accursed red-skin has fallen,” said Fred Travis.
“ Yes: out who fired the shot?” asked young Hawes. “ Does the Omaha know?’
“ Does not Death-Notch, the Young Bcalp-Hunt< r, lurk within these woods V'
The Avengers started at mention of this name of one whom none of them but the young Omaha had never seen, yet of whom they had heard most amazing reports. He was represented as being a youth of Titan proportions and power, onnmng as a fox and subtle as a serpent—a deadly enemy to the human race, going and ooming like one of supernatural powers and bearing the heart of a fiend. Human lives and human scalps were said to be the sole object of his search; and that upon a thousand different trees in the forest bordering the Little Sioux river, might be found the totem of this mad destroyer—a natch out with a tomahawk upon the trunk or limb of a tree, each notch representing a victim; and where the notch was found there could be found also a decaying oorpeo or bleaching skeleton.
No wonder then that the Eight Avengers started when the Friendly mentioned the name of Death-Notch.
“ Friend or foe,” replied Travis, flrmlv, “ we must do our work. Were Death-Notch twice the destroyer that he is, he must not stand In the way of our vengeance; nor shall he. Omaha, the duty devolves upon you to ascertain what that shot meant”
The Omaha at once glided from their midst as silently as a shadow, while the band in perfect stillness awaited his return. A few moments passed when a low whistle was heard.
“ That is the Omaha’s call,” said Travis ; “ advance!”
The little bond moved away to the woods, and •oon came to where the Indian was standing within the shadowBof a wide-branching tree.
“ What dlsoovery, OmahaP asked Travis. The young Indian pointed at the ground. There, half concelaled among the weeds and grass, lay the fonnof a Sioux warrior, dead and •calpless. From a deep gash in the left cheek the warm blood was still flowing.
' “Death-Notch has been here!” simply said the Friendly. “ Behold his totem I”
Every eye was turned in the direction indicated, and upon the trunk of the tree near where the dead warrior lay, they saw a small notch, evidently cut with a' hatchet, and so recently that the sap was still oozing from the wound.
The band stood for a moment silently before the dead ^urnor and the dread signet.
“ Where is he?” at length demanded Travis.
■	“Ask the winds,'’ was the Omaha’s reply; '*tMiiUi-Notch leaves no trail.”
Hot oaring to fan th* superstitious fear*
which it was apparent some of the band felt, Travis exclaimed:
“ Well, trail or no trail, we must on to our work. So forward all!”
In single file the little band set off through the forest.
History has recorded the horrors of the Spirit Lake Massacre, in the spring of 1857. A detachment of'braves of the great chief, Inkpa-ducha’s force, under Young Sleepy Eyes, descended upon the settlements in the vicinity of the lakes, killing and burning all before them.
At the time of the attack these young men were away several miles southward, hunting, but when they returned they found their homes destroyed and their friends all gone. Then they formed a compact which afterward rendered their names noted; they swore to track the merciless foe to death, and rescue their friends, if any still existed.
For (lays "had they traversed the treeless prairie and trackless wilderness, guided by the never-failing and indomitable Omaha. And now, as they moved on. and the sun mounted higher into theheavens, the air became hot and sultry and the sky overcast with clouds. To the Avengers these" were forebodings of a storm, still they pressed on, and whon the sun stood upon the'meridian, they stopped by a little stream to rest and refresh themselves from their meager supply of food.
Wliile thu6 engaged the sharp clatter of hoofs broke suddenly upon their ears. The next instant a youthful horseman came galloping from the shadows of the woods and swept tike a dart across the little valley before them.
The horseman "Was alnere boyT Be could not have been over sixteen, and was as fair and delicate in features as a maiden. Masses of long dark hair fell in ripples to his horse's back, and dark, lustrous eves looked sharply from between their long silken lashes. A little red cap with a single white feather surmounted his head. A blue jacket handsomely wrought with threads of gold clothed the beautiful rounded shoulders, slender form and well molded arms. The collar lay open, revealing a full, snow-white chest and throat.
The only weapon he possessed was a small, silver-mounted rifle, which he carried in front of him across the withers of the raven-black pony he bestrode.
The youth, seemingly, did not see our j-oung friends, but galloped across the valley and plunged Into the woods beyond.
“ Och, but he's a royal lad.” exclaimed young O’Ray. “Sich a form: sich hair; sich eyes, ay! be the Howly Mother, he must be a young god ave the woods.”
‘‘He was a fine-looking youth,” said Amos Meredith.
“ A voung ranger, I suppose,’- added another.
“ Boys,” said Fred Travis, “say what you may of that youth, I would venture my ufe, almost, on the cast that it is a female.”
" Then,” said Omaha, starting suddenly up, “ If that is the case. Death-Notch is a female, for you have looked upon the face of that terrible young Scalp-Hunter!”
CHAPTER II.
THE LOVERS.
A score of log-cabins surmounting a bold stony bluff, overlooking the Little Sioux river, comprised the settlement of Stony Cliff. It had first been established as a small trading-post by a party of French Canadians, and from year to year a family or two had been added to its population until it now numbered something like a hundred souls. Men had brought their families there and established themselves permanently, engaging principally in hunting and the fur trade. A few, however, followed the immoral calling of whisky-tradere. Another kept a gun-shop and variety-store, and a few tilled a number of acres of ground near the settlement.
Although Stony Cliff bore a disreputable name, as most all "these frontier posts generally do, it was not entirely wanting in morals. It had passed laws of its own, established a school and church, and strenuous efforts were made to bring all within the pale of Christianity. But in this it had failed in many instances, as the progress of our story will show.
At noon on the same day that our story opens, a young girl stood alono upon the banks or the river, within the shadow of a dump of trees, lesB t.hrn half a league below the settlement.
She was not over seventeen years of age, tall, queenly and graceful in proportion, and fair and lorvely in every feature. Before her upon the river a little canoe was rocking upon the waves, and in it lay the maiden’s hat and shawl.
As she walked to and fro beneath the arching boughs of the trees, she would start occasionally and glance anxiously about her, but, nothing meeting her gaze, a cloud of disappointment would settle upon her pretty face, and she would balf-nervously and half-angrily twist and .twirl the bouquet of wild flower* she held in.Mr fahnd.	*3"' ■
Was »ho tharo to meet somo one? Was die expecting an unfaithful lover?
As the moments wore on. the sound of a foot-
step broke suddenly upon her ears, and nfl the figure of a youth appeared from the shadflH of the woods and stood before her.
He was a handsome lad; of not over -‘fhUjJ or nineteen years, and, in spite of his yoola was possessed of all the developments of a mAfll Indeed, such perfection of manhood was seldom! found in a boy. He was of medium Mp*Sl with massive chest, muscular limbs, dark evil that sparkled with the light of a wild, dar&H spirit, clear-cut features and a »cll-definej] head, covered with a wealth of short, ariaSS curls.
He was dressed in a clean, neat-fitting garb of a hunter, and carried a rifle and huntW
knife.
The maiden did not start with surprise at sight of him. On the contrary, her face lit m with a light of love, and, advancing towaM. him, she said, in a petulant tone:
“ Oh, Ralph I why have you kept me waiting so long?”
“ I was not aware that I had. sweet Sylveent” he replied, in a low, pleasant voice, stooping and ldssing her upon the warm, flushed cheek.
"Why, yes, Ralph; I have been here for more than an hour,’1 Sylveen responded.
“ I’m sorry I kept you waiting, my love; but. then if you will look at that shadow, Sylveen, you will see I am here at the appointed hour.” 8vlveen Gray glanced at the shadow, and laughed softly.
"Oh, I know. Ralph; you are always true to me.” she said: "but I am so impatient ”
■’ You must try and grow out of that, Syl-veen."
“ I have tried, Ralph; tut anxiety for your safety keeps me in a fever of excitement all th»
time.''
“ Do not. I implore you, dear Sylveen. keep yourself uneasy aV>ut me. It is my solace—the guiding hope- of my future happiness, to know that you love me—that you are my own darling Sylveen. But. 1 would be still more happy did I know you were not fretting about mv safety. Rest assured that I wOJ not be so reckless of vour happiness as to thrust my bead incautiously into needless dangers.”
“ But, Ralph, you know,” Sylveen gently persisted, “that Deatb-Notch. the Scalp-Hunter, is in these woods, and that he favors none in his terrible vengeance.”
Ralph St. Leger smiled at the maiden's remarks. and replied:
" I have never yet seen Death-Notch. Sylveen, nor have I ever met a person that has seen him. Is he not a myth?”
*■ No. Ralph: several of the settlers have sees him at a distance.” said 8vlveen. “They said h). face was that of a mere "boy, but Uk»t he wa* a giant in stature."
Again Ralph St. Leger smiled. He was a youth whose education and natural good sense overbalanced all superstitious belief and reports, despite the fact that he was a bordermaa himself, a trapper-boy and free rover of the prairie.
“ WeU. dear, I may confess that there is such a person as he whom they call Death-Notch. I have seen his totem—the death-notch—upon a tree where lay a lifeless savage. But. I have reason to believe that Death-Notch is the white man’s friend.”
“ I wish I could only think so myself, Ralph, for just yesterday one of our settlers was found dead near the village. There was a deep wound on his left cheek, and a fresh notch cut on a little sapling near where the body lay. Death-Notch had slain him.”
“ What was the settler’s name ?" asked Ralph.
“El Pardou."
“ A French Canadian?”
"Yes.”
“ Perhaps Death-Notch may have held some grudge against him?”
" I cannot say, as to that,” replied Sylveen, “ but I do know he keeps Stony Cliff in a per petual state of excitement”
“ Not any more so, I suppose, than I under> stand he keeps the Indians/^ said St. Leger.
“ Perhaps not; but Ralph, will you not consent to take up your head-quarters at the settle mentf”
“Sylveen, I can not I love the wild wood* and its excitements, and I ask nothing mon besides than an occasional interview with my darling Sylveen.”
“ That you shall ever have, dear Ralph, un-less my" uncle forbids me leaving the settfe ment”
“ Has he threatened to do so, Sylveen r “No; but he knows I meet you, and of lat* he has intimated to me that he had chosen from hia acquaintance a young man who he thought would make me. a good husband. ”
Ralph’s brow darkened.
“ Did he mention his name?” he asked "Yes; it was Scott Shirely.”
“ Well. Sylveen, he is a handsome, dashing young cavalier, yet I have no fears of him winning you from me.”
" No. never, dear Ralph, and—’
She did not oomplete the sentence, for. at thil gmcture, the dip of an oar arrested their attar
Death-Notch, the Destroyer.
the place to see that no enemy had preceded them to the inviting shelter. Omaha entered the cabin, followed by his friends. Their footsteps sounded dead oil the damp puncheon floor, and thoir voices echoed hollow and sepulchral through the room.
By means in their possession a fire was hastily struck. Its light revealed a yawning fire-place in one end or the building, and in a very few minutes a roaring lire was burning upon the hearth, its cheerful heat dispelling much of the gloom from the place.
The Young Avengers were now enabled to obtain a fair view of the interior of their retreat The cabin was of goodly dimensions, strongly built of heavy logs. There was a loft in it made of heavy slabs or puncheons, as was also the floor. The building was divided into two compartments by straight-edged slabs set upright across the center of the house. There was an opening in the center of this partition that was used as a door, but was unclosed.
There was a rudo table and some rickety stools in the room, and around the walls were numerous gun racks, which gave evidence of the place having once been the house of a party of hunters.
The outer door was closed and securely bolted. Then the little party gathered around tne great stone hearth, to eat their supper and talk over their morrow’s work.
At length the whole party relaxed into silence I and listened to the howling storm without. It I was truly appalling. Only the Omalrn was on I the alert
In the heavy, ponderous door there was a | wioket which opened and closed with a strong ! slide set in grooves. This the young Indian used as a look-out and there was scarcely an | interval of ten minutes but a careful survey wus . mile of the yard in front of the cabin, the ! broad glare of the lightning enabling him u> j command a fair view of the glade.
The momenUi wore on, anu finally every voice j within the eahin became silent. This'lasted . several minutes, when all of a sudden Omaha i sprung to his feet and advancing to the door. ] opened the wicket and gazed out The Young Avengers were startled by this I sudden movement They knew that Omaha’s ! sense of hearing was never at fault and from I his actions they believed he bad detected the presence of something not altogether right j For a moment the Friendly stood with his face pressed close to the wicket then he with- 1 drew, closed the opening, and turning, walked 1 slowly and calmly back to the fire.
“ I nave something to tell you, friends," he i said.
“ What is it? Has the storm blown overT' | “No; Death-Notch, the Young Scalp-Hunter, I is at the door!"
CHAPTER IV.
STAJM-UHO INFORMATION.
Ajteb her interview with Ralph St. Leger, Sylveen Gray entered her canoe and started on her return to the village.
She was at once discovered by her uncle, Abel Hatch and Scott Shirely, who were coming down the river, and who at once headed their canoe directly toward her. In a few moments they were alongside of her canoe.
Abel Hatch was a stem-looking man of some fifty years of age, with features and eves that were not altogether pleasant in their expression. His companion, Scott Shirely. was a young man of some flve-and-twentv, tail and "handsome, and possessed of a form and air that reminded one of a young and dashing cavalier of the Middle Ages.
His eyes were coal-black, as were also his long wavy hair and heavv mustache. He was dressed in a kind of flashy uniform, cavalry boots, and a broad-brimmed hat from which a red plume hung down over his shoulder.
He was fcy occupation, representing, as agent, the Hudson Bay Fur Company. He made his head-quarters at Stony Cliff. Here he had been engagkl for over a year, and had made the fur trade a lucrative one for the hunters and trappers that comprised the majority of the population of Stony Cliff. He also employed a number of sub-agents who traded with’the Indians and hunters at a distance from the village. These agents were mostly French Canadians, and a rough set of men.
“ Where now has my truant little ward been?” asked Abel Hatch, as they ran alongside of Sylvoen’s canoe.
Sylveen blushed scarlet, and before she could reply, or recover from her embarrassment, Scott Shirely said:
“ Mr. Hatch, If you are going on down the river to your bear-traps. I believe I will return with Sylveen U she has no objections.”
Before Sylveen could utter a protest against his intention, in case she had any deure to do so at all, the young fur-trader arose to bis feet and stepped hghtly into her canoe.
Then Abel Hatch drove his craft on down the river and Sylveen and Shirely were alone.
"Sylveen, let me use the paddle,” said the young fur-agent, seating himself before the maiden
Sylveen yielded relactantly to his request, for
Out upon the river they saw a canoe coming down from the settlement. In it were seated two man, one of whom was Sylveen tiray’s ancle aad guardian. Abel Hatch, and the other Scott Shirely.
Sylvan started violently at sight of them, and turning to her lover, said:
I will have to leave you, dear Ralph. You know uncle Abe) does not like you, and this meeting I desire to remain unknown to him.” “Yes, go, dear Sylveen. In two days I will be here at noon again. Good-by.”
Ho stooped and kissed her. then turned and glided away into the deep shadows of the wood, while Sylveen entered her canoe, and started on her return to the village.
For several minutes Ralph 8t. Leger pursued his way onward through the woods, keeping within the deepest shadows. Finally he came to ,a little thicket of undergrowth, in the center of •which stood a low, scrubby oak.
Pausing, be gazed carefully around him, then parting the shrubbery he entered the thicket, imn>l was lost from view.
A few momenta later, a powerful Indian warrior, with tomahawk in hand, crept from an adjacent clump of bushos, and half crouch -Inf stole into the thicket directly on the trail of St. Leger. There was death in the basilisk eyes of the savage, and, as the moments won-on, a low, half-suppressed wail suddenly issued from the depths of the thicket. Then followed an ominous silence, which was finally broken by the sound of footstep retreating from the undergrowth. And still, a few minutes later, .another figure emerged from the woods beyond, paused and gazed with starting eyes upon the thicket It was the figure of an Indian, but his face wore no paint, nor evil, cunning expression. It was Omaha, the scout and guide if the Yomu AvBngersI F»r several moments he stood and gaaed upon uni over the thicket; then he plaoed his fingers » his lips, and produced a succession of peculiar tounds, and forth from the woods issued seven 'orras. They were those of our friends, the feting Avengers.
‘ \\ hat discovery, Omaha?” asked young rravis.
A white youth entered the thicket. A powerful Sioux warrior followed him. A death-wail; retreating footsteps, and then silence. Death is in yon bushes. Come.”
The Friendly led the way into the thicket, followed by his white companions.
Under the drooping boughs of the oak they to a halt There!” exclaimed the Friendly.
All eyes were at onoe turned in the direction Indicated, and saw, lying upon the earth among the deepest shadows, the lifeless form of a Biotix warrior. He was scalplesa. Across the left cheek was a deep wound, from which the blood was still pouring in a hot current.
' ’ Death-Notch has Deen here,” said Omaha, and he pointed to a fresh notch out on a low Wougli directly over the fallen warrior.
CHAPTER ILL
THE DESERTED HUT.
It waa sunset Ominous clouds were piled up Against the western sky like the dark line of a giant mountain. Electric flashes shot along pie craggy edges of the somber clouds, followed 1 y the dull, sullen rumble of thunder. The wind A/as rising and raving in fitful gusts through the forest, shrieking like a demon over the hills and through the valleys.
A fearful storm was brewing, yet on through tne dark aisles of the forest pressed the little band of Avengers, guided by the indomitable Omaha. The bellowing thunder, the vivid lightning, the howling wind and roaring trees, to them was but the spirit of adventure. As they continued on. however, the darkness became so intense that their red guide was compelled to resort to the moss on the trees in order to keep his course.
“This is getting to be tedious traveling. Omaha,” said Fred Travis. “ How far is it to the deserted cabin of which you spoker '
“ Not tar,” was the laconic reply.
The party pressed on in silence for nearly an hour after nightfall, when they came to the edge of a little glade. In the center of this opening, a prolonged flash of lightning showed iheni a log cabin, standing solitary and alone.
| It was almost hidden from view by tail, rank weeds that grew to the very threshold, and which was evidence of itself that the building had not been inhabited bv any one for years, | save by bats and owls. Wild ivy clambered over the outer walls and over the roof, excluding the sunshine, thereby making it damp and moldy within. It was a desolated, deserted ruin, whose history was unknown to our party. Only Omaha knew, before that night, that such a cabin existed, In his wanderings abroad from •the settlement, over two years before, he had run across it.
j -Omaha led the way .across the yard to the cabin in the great wu^eraa*. The door stocx! I ajar, and was swaying to and fro on its heavy I . yrooden hinges, that freaked and groaned in ax I -•ruinous QT11' ghostlike manner.

she would much rather have been alone with her own thoughts than in the company of Scott Shirely.
“'I nope, Sylveen,” he said, apologetically, “that my company will not be distasteful to
you.” .
“Oh, no, not at all, Mr. Shirely.” replied Sylveen, with a slight tinge of sarcasm in her
voice.
“ I am quite fortunate, then, in dropping Into your company. Miss Gray. Times are very, very dull at Stony Cliff just now. If it was not for the little excitement kept up i> oousequence of Death-Notch's doings, and by the freebooters under the notorious Pirate Paul, I’m thinking the Cliff would become as dreary as a rainy day.”
Have you heard any new reports about Death-Notch to-day f” asked Sylveen.
“ Nothing since poor El Paraou’s death."
“And what of Pirate Paul?”
“ He is said to be about,’’ said Shirely, aai he fixed his eyes on Sylveen’s with a strong* light shining from their depths.
Sylveen, however, did not notioe the expression.
“ Who has seen him..*’ she finally asked.
“I have," replied Shirely.
“You! Is it possible' ’When did you so. him, Mr. Shirely .”
"To-day.”
Sylveen uttered a little cry of fear “"But, Sylveen. why is it that your lover,” continued Shirely. “ does not visit you at your homeT’
Sylveen started as though a serpent had hissed in her ear. Her face grew deathly pale, her dork-blue eves flashed with indignation, and her lip curled with scorn and di«H«in " What do you know, 8cott Shirely, of mv lover! Have you been eavesdropping like a—r “Nay. nay, Bylveen,” the young agent re plied, in a regretful tone; “ out there is one whose duty it has been to keep on the alert It is not generally knowu, Sylveen, that you have been meeting Ralph St. Leger in secret interviews; but why, Sylveen, does he not coma to see vou at 8tony Cliff)’'
“"He has his own reasons for not doing so,” replied Sylveen. disdainfully.
Yes, indeed, he has, Sylveen. He knows it would not be well for him to be caught in the village, for there are thoee there who would recognize him as Pirate Paul, chief of th« prairie robbers.’’
“■What!" Sylveen almost shrieked. “Ralph St. Leger. Pirate Paul?”
’Tis even so, Bylveen," replied Shirely: but the maiden was too much absorbed in her emotions to notice the latent meaning in his tone.
"Oh, my God!" she fairly moaned, ‘‘surely you are jesting, Mr. Shirely.*
" I am not, Sylveen. I would not trifle with the feelings of one so pure and honest-hearted as you. But time will convince you that I speak the truth; and when your love for Ralph St Leger has turned to hatred, then will I hop* myself to gain that love which the young prairta freebooter has dared to gain. ”
“ Mr. Shirely, I am ever bo much obliged to you for this information if itistme; but not until I know positively that such is the case, will I believe that one so manly and open-hearted as Ralph St. Leger appears to be, could ba guiltj" of such a crime.”
“The proof shall be given, in due time.” replied the young fur-agent; “ forovBr a month j there has been a spy on his track, consequently I j know whereof I speak. But, Sylveen. let us talk of something more pleasant. Have you ! made the acquaintance of the new family lately j come to Stony Cliffr’
| “ You allude to the Gregory family, do you i not f asked the maiden, though her thought*
1 seemed to be far away.
' Yes,” replied Shirely.
I "I called yesterday to see them. They ap-i pear t< > tie fine people
"There is a young woman in the family, bi there not i"
"Yes; Miss Martha Gregory. But her health is very' poorly and she is unable to be out of her room half the time. She seemed greatly shocked by the news of El Pardou's death at the bands of Death-Notch."
“ She did V' questioned Shirely, and there waa a little strangeness in his tone.
“Yes,” replied Sylveen. “I suppose she t* somewhat nervous and unused to these horror, of frontier life.”
By this time they had reached a point when the bluffs rose np on each side of the river, In places to the hight of a hundred feet Atdlf-t Cerent points the uljiTa were shelving their I faces covered with creepers and parasitical I plants and variegated colors that trailed in rich feetoonery to the water’s edge.
1 The young trader drove the canoe on up A* i j*i ver until he came to where the bluffs were precipitous, and where a rode stairway bad been chipped in the rock from the water1, edge to the summit of the escarpment At the foot of tbeee steps be permitted th* prow of the canoe to touch. Then he leaped out and assisted Sylveen ashore.
Together they ascended the rode ftairwv tt
14
'V
the top of the blnff and there found themselves within the outskirts of Stony Cliff.
The cabins were scattered over several acres of the bluffs, the forest funning the eastern and southern boundaries, and being located in a bold curve of the river, it formed the other two limits of the settlement.
Svlve«n went home, an/I after she had thought and" cned over what Scott Shirely had told her of her luver, she composed herself and went over to see her new neighbors, the Gregorys.
She found Miss Martha Gregory an agreeable and amiable young lady of some twenty summers. She was very pretty, with large, mournful eyes, which a great portion of the time were concealed by a pair of green goggles worn on account of the weakness of her eyes contracted from a late spell of sickness.
Her face was a little thin and pale, yet bore ample traces of its natural beauty. Sylveon at once- became struck with her lady-like appearance and gentle and affable manners. She spent most of the afternoon with Miss Gregory, and became so impressed with her in every respect, that, before she went home she had made a confidant of her. and told her all about her own troubles of that day.
Miss Martha expressed great surprise at 8yl-veen's Ktory, and aid all she could to assuage her sadness of heart. They talked on for some time, when Martha finally asked:
" Who told you, Sylveen, that Ralph St. Leger is the notorious 1*1 rate PaulP’
•‘Mr Soott Shirely, the fur-agent. Probably you have met him.”
“ Oh, yes. He is the handsome young fellow with the killing black mustache and red plume I”
“ The same.”
“Oh, I dare say all the young girls will be dead in love with him yet," and Martha laughed merrily.
Despite her sadness of heart, Svlvoen laughed too. and admitted to herself that Martha was iust such a girl as would make all happy around her
“ 1 have heard, 8y1veen,” continued Martha.
' • since we came here that your uncle had chosen Mr. Shirely as a husband for you. Is it the casef’
“ It is. Miss Gregory.”
•• And is there no way of averting your uncle's win m this matter r “ None now. Martha, unless it is proven that Ralph St. Leger is not Pirate Paul. Uncle Abel ■s a verv obstinate and selfish man. and I think he is actuated in this matter by cupidity, for he has intimated to me that Shirelv is a "wealthy man—heir to a l<u-g« fortune in Montreal.”
Mias (iregory uttered a little cry of surprise, and Sylveen noticed the color come and go in her *ice. and saw her compress her lips as if to keep l>a<-k an outburst of emotion. It was sev era1 moments before she spoke, then her voice was lower and more earnest in its tones.
' Sylveen." she said. I must admit that I am a curious person; and now I am going to make a confidant of you. and it will be all for your own good. Our coming here is not without a purpose. My name is not Martha Gregory, but I have assumed that name because it is the name of the family I live with. Like yourself. I am an orphan, "and I have been wronged as •thers are now trying to wrong you. But, I will prevent them: but you must know me only as the daughter of Peter Gregory. I can thwart any project your uncle may put on foot for your marriage with any one to whom you are opposed Remember t'Oat. I will also tell you, Sylveen. that Stony Cliff and half of its men are at my mercy, though they know it not. And here.’' she continued, taking Sylveen’s hand In hers, and slipping a beautiful and curious wrought gold ring upon her finger—" I give you a ring which will be a charm against prairie pirates."
Sylveen soemod not a little puzzled by her words.
" It is true. Sylveen, however absurd it may sound to you Whenever any person sees that ring and starts and stares at it as one would at a ghost, mark my words, tu is a prairie ]riratel If he should inquire where you got the ring, tell him it was a present from a friend. But do not, I implore you, tell him you reoeived it of Martha Gregor}’, nor repeat one word of which 1 have told von.”
Though she was strangely impressed by Miss Gregory’s words, Sylveen promised that she would not hint one word ol what she had told her. But no sooner had Martha told her that the ring was a charm against prairie robbers than she became sorely impatient to try its reputed magic power upon Ralph St. Leger, whom Scott Shirely had asserted was the notorious Pirate PauL _

■	barbarous foe. tnev (led from their old haunts i and sought safety within the fastnesses of the ! woods and hills "bordering the Sioux river, i where we now find them, and where they remained until their final retreat beyond the"Missouri.
The Indian village was some fifteen miles from Stony Cliff, and although the Indians and whites were on hostile terms, the former had never molested the settlers. Still, however, they had made many demonstrations of a threatening character, and consequently kept the whites in a constant state of uneasiness.
Toward tbe Indian village, through a storm that was raging, a solitary horseman was riding at a furious speed. It was night, black ana gioomv. rendered doubly so by the deep shadow’s of the forest through which lay his course. Now and then the lightning shot in vivid flashes down through the tree-tops and lit up his grim, bearded face.
He was wrapped in tbe folds of a water-proof blanket, and wore a broad brimmed hat that was Blouched to his shoulders. His hands and arms were drawn securely up under his blanket, giving the animal the reins and permitting it to take it« own course, which it did to his rider's satisfaction.
This was evidence of i tself that the horse was well accustomed to the path it was following, and surely that bearded stranger's mission must have been of great importance, or why would we have ventured out upon such a wild, stormy night as this!
On he galloped, now looming up like a Colossus into the lightning’s glare, now fading awav, as it were, into the blinding darkness that followed. But as he continued on. lights in the I Indian village burst upon his view. A smile of joy passed over his grim, bearded face. He I spurred on. A savage picket challenged him.
He never slacked his pace, but gave a low I whistle by which he was known, and galloped on, straight into the Indian town, following its ) crooked streets with the same familiarity with I which he had traversed the forest.
! Finattv he drew rein before a large coniool i structure, whose imposing and centra) position told him it was the Council Lodge of the tribe.
I Dismounting, he hitched his foaming, (uinting horse to a stake hard by, and strode up to the | door of the lodge. Here he uttered a low whistle, then the flap-door was raised, and he 1 was admitted into the lodge.
There were two persons in the lodge, Inkpa-i duc-ah and a fellow chief. "The latter held a ; glowing torch in his hand that lit up the lodge.
The white man threw aside his dripping hat | and blanket, and took a seat facing the central j lodge-pole.
I " The gods frown angrily to-night, my red i friends.” ne said, in the dialect of the Sioujt.
I “ Le 8ubtile Fox. the Great Spirit is angry."
| replied Inkpaducah. speaking in the ffgurative j language so characteristic of the Indian osator | “ He speaks m tones of thunder, and hurls his lances of fire down upon the earth. He knows i that death is in the forest, and has put a ctoud t over the brow of the heavens, and causes it to shed tears upon the earth, to wash out the stains of blood, and hide the trail of the Sioux ■ from the eyes of Death-Notch, the Young Scalp-! Hunter."
Before Le Subtile Fox could reply, the door l was opened and a chief, wrapped in a" blanket to protect him from the driving rain, entered the lodge and took his seat in the circle. He was ; soon followed by another and another, until the circle was almost full. As the rain was de-i scending in torrents, each one came wrapped in ! his blanket, which was thrown hood-like over , his head to protect his paint and feathered , head-gear. Some of them, on taking their ; seats, did not remove their blankets, and conM ! I only be disitnguished by each one’s totem, , which was wrought in bright colors upon his 1 blanket.
Inkpaducah glanced over the party assembled I and said:
! “My young chiefs are all in but one. Red , Antelope is still absent. But he will come soon j —ugh, he is here now."
j Red Antelope entered the lodge, enveloped I from head to foot in his loof. tty blanket.
"The council isfull,"«iu Inkpaducah; “let j any one speak who has anything to say. ”
I	r‘ Then I will ask you,” said tie renegade Le Subtile Fox. who. it was easy to see, wore a mask of false whiskers, “if Death-Notch has been in your camp again?"
“ No;"he dare not come within our rilWe. But he prowls through the woods and strikes my braves down when they go alone to shoot the deer. Go where you will, ms terrible death-notcb may be seen upon the tree* of the forest • And to-day comes the wail of another of my warriors whose cheek bean the fotta of the , Young Scalp-Hunter."
’* Death-Notch is a terrible creature.” said the white renegade: “ but let the chief prepare, far : another eonsy is approaching.’’
“ Let Le Subtile Fox speak. His voice w strong in the cotineil."
“Well, a band of eight persons, young men, strong and brave, and calling themselves Tha Spirit Lake Avengers, are in the woods. They come to avenge the death of their friends slain by yon at Okibogi and Spirit lakes. Omaha, the white man’s friend, is with them!"
The hrow of the chief became clouded, and his eyes flashed with a revengeful fire, while a low exclamation escaped the lips of his owa-/ panions, and their breasts heaved with emotions of revenge.
" Let the young Omaha sing his death-song,” the old chief at last, broke forth; *' the blood of a hundred cf his friends reddened the snows of last winter, and their scalps are drying in tha lodge of the Sioux. Sleepy Eves, with a score of picked warriors, are upon die trail of Death-Notch. They will meet the Omaha and his white friends in tbe forest, and when they re-turn they may bring the scalps of these A veng. ent as well as that of the terrible Death. Notch.”
“ Ugh !” ejaculated one of the savages in the circle of forms. It was red Antelope, who stiB kept his face concealed with his blanket.
“ Whv does Red Antelope grunt?” asked the head chief, turning upon the savage with an indignant uoowl. '’Does he feel envious of the fame of young Sleepy Eyes t ct does be doubt the words" of Inkpaducah 1 Let Red Antelope speak.”
The chief addressed arose to his feet and drawing his blanket closer over his face a> he did so. advanced to the center of the lodge, and putting out his tomahawk, struck the central pole twice with the keen edge of the weapon, cutting a deep notch In the stake.
•' Ah !’’ exclaimed Inkpaducah, indignantly; “ Red Antelope answers my questions by cutting the totem of Death-Notch upon the central pole. Is he a coward—a weak squaw! Does ha fear Death-Notch ! Let him speak.”
“ Inkpaducah.” said the shrouded Red-Antelope. in a tone that caused the counselorsto start, " you and yonrwamors are a set of fools. Red Antelope liras dead on the outskirts of your village by tne hands of Death-Notch. The destroyer is at hand. He is even here in your eouncil-lodge I Beheld him !" cried the supposed warrior, flinging aside his blanket; 2 am Death-Notch /”
. A cry of terror pealed from the lips of the savage chieftains, and they started to their fesf. But, at the same instant, they found themselvs1; in blinding darkness.
The supposed Red Antelope, dashing to tlM earth the torch that lit up the lodge, lnstantlt threw his thick, water-eoajied blanket over it. Then arose a fearful yell, followed bv direful confusion—a terrible struggle in the dark. Dull, sodden blows were heard, mingled with the craok. crack of a revolver, cries of agony, and shouts of triumph.
In the midst of the conflict, where chiefs struggled and grappled with chiefs, thinking that each was their detested foe Death-Notch, a figure glided from the council-lodge, and leaping dnto the back of Le Subtile Fox’s horse, dashed away through the village, night and storm into the almost impenetrable darkness of the woods.
The village was aroused. The cries of th* chiefs sounded higli above the roar of the rain and the rumble of the thunder.
Forth from their tents the warriors cam* iiouring to the council-lodge. Then they learned that Death-Notch had been in their village, and had occupied a seat in their council. Upon tb» central pole was pointed out his totem, the death-notch, which he had cut with his own hand before their own eves.
A dead chief, and two’ wounded ones, lving in the council-lodge confirmed this evldenoe--Death-Notch had been there.
CHAPTER VL
A NEW DANGER
“ Dbath-Notch is at the door.”
The words fell from Omaha’s lips like a thunderbolt from a cloudless winter sky Tb» Young Avengers started to their feet and geaA in speechless surprise at the door, as if expecting to see the young destroyer burst in upon \ them.
The shock had come unexpected, and although ' their number assured them of their ability w' defy his power, they were thrown into a stria -of great suspense and anxiety, through their expectancy of standing face to face with thf dreaded young Scalp-Hunter.
But while they thus stood with their ey»£ fixed upon the dlqor, they were startled by j sound m the adjoining room. It was a dial.; sodden sound, like that which would be pro*';': I dnced by the fall of a heavy body. They their eyes upon the partition door, thra gtaneak ] from one to the other interrogatively.

The New York Library.
hawk rose and fen with deadly precision np.» the heads of the Ravage foe.
The tide of battle turned in a moment.
" Death-NotchI Death-NotchI” burst in cents of terror from the lips of the Ravages, and the few that were alive and able, fil'd'from the but, and sought safety under cover of tha night and storm. The conflict was ended. St* of the ten savages lay dead and dying. Three of the Avengers were seriously woundi-d, and but for the cramped position in which the savage* were compelled to fight with their tomahawks, some of the Avengers would have undoubtedly been slain.
In a minute, almost, after the conflict, mo6t of its terrors were forgotten by the Young Avengers, in the startling realization ?f their beingin the presence of the terrible Deati i-Notch, he who had buret in during the conflict t .id routed the Bavages.
Not a little surprised were our frier di to sef that the young Scalp-Hunter was '.1 about medium size, and wore a regular bunter-gorb oi
■	buck-skin. His head-gear, nowever, icas quite a novelty. It was a steel cap, not altogether unlike the morion worn by the warriors of the middle ages. To this can was attache a beaver which entirely concealed the face. But masses of long, rippling black hair fell down ho hack, and black, fiery eyes gleamed through tt ( holes
Of l>i« ttih kV
Fred Travis’ mind at once reverted )o tha youthful horseman he had seen thut day ,a the forest—the same whom Omaha l;ad si.il was Death-Notch, and whom he had said was a female. The being before him uemed larger than the horseman; but then he was dressed differently. And there was that same wealth of raven tresses, regal head and swelling chest. But were they one and the same person!
Our young friends seeing that he offered them no violence—in fact, had proven a friend in the most dangerous moment of their lives— supposed at once that he was some eccentric being, more daring than wise.
Fred Travis was the first to speak.
“ Your coining was very opportune."
“ Glad to hear it,’’ said the stranger, in a bone that was soft and musical as a woman’s. "But then yon were pressing the red devils closely, niv voung friends.”
Pardon me, but may I ask who you areT
Thf masked avenger made no reply, but raiding aloft his tomahawk, he struck the wall twice with its keen edge, and chipped out a small notch thereon.
“ Do you understand that?” he asked.
" It is the Asath-notch of the young Scalp-Hunter.”
As such 1 am known," replied the avenger, " though I hope I am not as terrible a creature to you as I am reputed to be to the whites. The whites are my own race and friends; but tha Sioux—curse them I—I am mad-crazy with hatred and vengeance toward them!”
The voung Scalp-Hunter did not remove his mask, but passed his hand over it occasionally, to see that no part of his face was exposed. But, despite this eccentricity, the Young Avengers became decidedly easy over the true character of Death-Notch. That he was young there was not a single doubt. That he was adeadly foe of the savages was no mort than they had anticipated, and those fabulous stories of his colossal size were proven to be “ moonshine.”
A cry of pain from one of the Avengers drew the attention of his companions from Death-Notch, and they at once proceeded to ascerthin the extent of each one’s injury, and dress tha wounds as well as their surgical skill would admit. In this they were assisted by the young Scalp-Hunter, who showed that be had a heart capable of the tenderest of human sympathies.
The wounded being cared for, the band began removing the lifeless savages from the cabin; and white thus engaged, the crack of n rifle was suddenly heard without. A bullet whizzed into the room through the open door, and Deatb-Notch was heard to utter a low, quick gasp, and was seen to stagger and sink to bis knees.
The door was instantly closed and barred by Omaha, while Fred Travis sprung to Deatb-Notch s assistance, exclaiming:
"My Ood, young friend, aro you shot/”
“ Not bad, was the laconic reply of the voung Scalp-Hunter. as he arose to his feet * 1 did; however, receive quite a blow from sn ounce ball of lead.; but there was insufficient j^wder behind it to do its work. See there."
As be spoke, he drew from the Ixkooi of his hunting-shirt a battered bullet, and handed it to Fred for inspection. There was no trick about it. It was a genuine leaden ball, still warm with the heat of the powder and the Motion of the concussion.
The sight of this bullet filled the voung man with no little surprise and wonder. By what power was the ScaJp-Huntfer enabled to stay tha danger of a leaden ballf It looked n little strange.
Death-Notch Baw that our friends were pu»-zlod and at once drew their attention from the incident by an evasive remark.
In a short time the excitement had subsided, and the Lake Avengers found thsmselvM is a genera' conversation with the	stnofm.
figure appeared in the doorway But it was not Death-NQtch To their surprise, it was the fom of a young Indian, whose gaudy head-dress be spoke the insirniu of a chief He was a Sioux, painted ami plumed for the war-path He wtm a ta!|, powerful faUovV, with a broad, evil face, upoQ. which, rested a. malicious, sinister smile and snujil black eyes seemed half-closed, as If domed by the light of the fire that was roaring qn the he«rth.
He. stood directly in the doorway, with his mnacblor arms folded over bis massive chest. In token of friendship and peace. There was something Imposing in his powerful, handsome form, and his fearless, easy attitude, and for a moment our*friends regarded him with a look of mingled surprise and admiration.
Tnen, the band of Omaha wns seen to steal slowly tdjvard his girdle, and a cloud of scorn and indignation to settle upon his dusky face. Then his lips were seen to part, and with ail the disdain and insult which he could throw into his tone, he asked:
■	Ugh: what does young Sleepy-Eyes, the dog of a Sioux, want here.'”
11	Scalps!” was the prompt and laconic reply of the haughty chief, as a grim smile swept over his broad, sensual face.
The hands of our young friends quickly flew to their belts; but. despite this hostile manifestation, yoyng Sleepy-Eyes never moved a muscle, but seemed to be totally oblivious to tiie movement.
Omaha’s native vindictiveness was beginning to rue to a point almost bevond restraint.
“ Let the friends of Omaha," be said, addres*-m; his friends. " look upon Sleepy-Eyes, the murderer of their friends, and say 'whether he ■hall stand there and defiantly tell us he is here for scalps
Still Sleepy-Eyes never moved a muscle, but rvtained his silent, disdaiufol attitude.
To our wiute friends it now became evident that Omaha wa3 the object of his contempt, and that he w.i* waiting the address of an enemy mere worthy of his august ruoognition. So rred Travis addressed him in the Sioux dialect. «f whjeh he was master.
“ Wbat does the young Sioux chief seek here alone r be asked.
Youag Sleepy-Eyoe drew himself up to his full higbt His breast swelled out, and, with a slight toss of the plumed head, which indicated his recognition of young Travis, he replied:
•‘These woods are the hunting-grounds of the Sionx. He has a right to go where his will dictates. What do the young pale-faces seek here on our hunting ground?"
“•Shelter from ttie storm was the object that brought us to this cabin." replied Fred, ova-aivoly.
‘But you carry arms," said the chief, glancing at their rifles leaning against the wall: “ and a dog of an Omaha keeps you company.”
A fierce, revengeful light snot from the eves of Omaha. His fingers tightened upon tlie haft of his tomahawk, and but for the look which Fred gave him he would have struck the chief down. He had learned forbearance of the white man; and, turning on his heel with a contemptuous smile, walked away. But of all this the young chief seemed totally unconscious, showing with what contempt an Indian regards an enemy of his own race.
"Omaha,” said Travis, “is our friend and guide.”
But why do the young white braves wander so far from the lodges of their fathers'”
“ Go ask the waters of Okibogi and Spirit lakes. Listen to the winds whis|>ering to the forest-leaves of what they saw when the Sioux and Dacotahs were there. Our fathers are dead, and their wigwams are in ashes.’’
'‘Then the children of the white braves have come to avenge their death r said Sleepy-Eyes.
“ We have not harmed the hair of a Sioux’s head,” replied Travis. “ We have come to ascertain whether the Sioux carried any of our friends away into captivity."
“ Go then to our village and see." returned Bloepy-Eyes. and there was an undercurrent in his tone and looks which our friends did not fail to understand.
Death-Notch was altogether forgotten by the whites. They supposed at once Omaha hod mistaken Sleepy-Eyes—who had entered by Bome secret passage—for the young Scalp-Hunter. But it seemed a little strange to them that Sleepy-Eyee should appear so overbearing and insolent unless it was a vail to conceal bis savage fears.
The storm without was growing fiercer each moment. Drops of rain, mingled with hail, had begun to fall in a sullen and cnntinnntiK roar upon the roof.
“Perhaps,” said young Travis, determined to show the chief no favors, "yon can tell us whether you hare any of our friends captives, ornot T
And if I refuse, what then r asked the chief.
“We will he oom polled to detain yon a prisoner until jou give us the desired information, or exchange you, should we find any of our friends are captives."
A soomful tuiiilo convul~ .1 th< L:;,r-l. sen-
I sual face of the voung chief. He made no reply j to Travis’ remarks, but stepped to one side from I from the passage. Then what was our young friends' surprise to see a second Indian appear J in the doorway, from the shadows of the adjacent room.
' A dark suspicion rushed suddenly across our I young friends’ minds, and that suspicion was ; soon verified when they. 6aw this second savage . step aside and third one appear, followed by | a fourth, fifth, and so on, until ten grim and I hideous Indian warriors stood before them, i tomahawk in hand.
Fred now knew the cause of the chiefs insolence, and realized what a terrible blunder they had committed.
Without a doubt the cunning Sioux had en-, «xmoed themselves in the dark loft, or adjacent ; room, before they had entered the cabin, and yet with such cunning and caution that not the least sign of their presence had been discovered by the keen, watchful eyes of Omaha.
] An indiscriminate massacre now seemed imminent. The young men had laid aside most of their weapons, and one movement toward their I recovery would be the signal for the Indians to i strike. In the breast pocket of his hunting-shirt, however, Fred Travis carried a small pistoi. and in order to get hold of it without ' awakening suspicion, he calmly folded his arms ! across his breast, permitting ’ his liand to Blip , into his pocket as he did so.
' At the same instant the same thought seemed | to have inspired his companions, and instead of . manifesting a fear corresponding with their i danger, they assumed an attitude of ease and indifference'
There were several moments of silence, during . which time the two luies of enemies stood eying I each other, the savages with faces aglow with I fiendish triumph; the whites with faces that wore the calmness of bravo men when their . lives stand in imminent peril.
Sleepv-Eyes was the first to break the silence. He spote to Fred Travis, who stood directly in l front of him.
' “Will the voung pate-face still say be will [ keep Sleepv-Eyes a prisoner? Or do** his bravery grow weak at the sight of my warriors?”
Fred felt as keenly the retort of the chief as he did the peril of Ins situation , but with creditable promptness be replied:
" I care not to idle words with Sloepv-Eyes, but if he has come here to quarrel with us, he will never leave here alive with his warriors. ”
A low, silent and mocking laugh escaped the savage’s lips, and but for this slight confusion they might have heard the click of Fred’s pistol-lock in nis bosom. but to his threat, the chief retorted:
“ Sleepy-Eyes quarrels not with an inferior
foe.”
“ But he will scalp innocent women and children, like a sneaking coward,” replied Fred, indignantly. The vouth saw what was coming —that a conflict was inevitable—and he resolved to resent in words, at least, the insults of the subtle savage.
“ Ugh!” ejaculated the chief. “ The pale-foce speaks now Uke a weak squaw—with a crooked tongue."
These were the last words the contemptuous chief ever uttered. There was a flash before his eyes, the crack of a pistol, and he fell dead with a bullet-hole through his forehead.
Then arose a savage yell, mingled with the battle-cry of the Young Avengers, and the next instant the two tines seemed to dissolve into one. Knives and pistols leaped from their concealments, and tomahawks (lashed in the light of the fire as they rose and fell through the air; and high above the roar of the storm without rung the cries of the combatantB, the shrieks of the dying and the clash of steel.
CHAPTER VII.
THE CONFLICT AN» ITS RESULT.
It was a fearful moment there, within the deserted hut. Stung to fury by the death of their chief, the savages pressed hard upon the Young Avengers. But the latter were trained, strong and skillful, and while they managed to ward off the blows of the savages, they made every shot and thrust count Some grappled and fought hand to hand, but, with his tomahawk in his hand, Omaha struck right and left with terrible precision. It seemed impossible that men could fight so hard and long, and none of them fall, but for several minutes the conflict seemed about equal None had fallen, yet several were wounded on both sides, for the floor wn* getting wet and slippery with their blood.
Suddenly, above the din of the conflict and roar of the storm, a wild voice was heard without demanding admittance to the cabin, each shout being accompanied by a heavy blow upon the cabin door. But this lasted only for a moment. The door yielded, and a figure rushed in—the flgnre of a man. In one hand he held a tomahawk, in the other one of the then most deadly weapons of the day. a Colt’s revolver. From the latter weapon report after report rung out. and, bp an accompaniment, the toma-
o. 7.
Death-Notch. the Destroyer.
■Pffy found him to be a person of more than or-gpnary character. His language was guarded. g|llt showed evidence of some educational reflne-Kmnte and good thoughts. But when asked Pwhy be pursued suoh a cotLrae o( vengeance, he Kjpued:
E }' I can not help it. This may seem an absurd ifilMertion to you, but It is trna. There are times, ^however, when my soul shudders with horror at J'the deeds of my vengeance. Then again my >> heart becomes fired uncontrollably with that maddening passion. I can not fight it back. It t'eomes upon me liko the spasms of one addicted to periodical attacks of insanity. Yet, for all this. 1 feel that I have a just cause for my deeds of revenge. And I think sometimes, however absurd that thought may be, that Heaven justifies me in my course.' And there are other «arages yet to reel the weight of my vangeance, as 1 have felt and Buffered the weight of their barbarity- The 6ries of a tortured mother and ange I sinter ring in my ears in fancy ns they did In reality, for long bitter weeks, while in the hatuls of these red fiends. And as I was compel! od to witness their suffering, agony, and r*lhmne,-so shall their captors witness my revenge. ”
e A deep silence followed this revelation of sorrow and vengeance. Every heart had boen alike touchea with pity and revenge. The ; Avengers felt that their own fates were in a manner connected with that of the young Scalp-Hunter, and at once made known to him the ob-1 Jeot that had led. them into the country.
When he bad heard their story of the murder of their friends at the lakes, Death-Notcb expressed his heartfelt sympathies for them, and pj-omised to aid them, as far as possible, in their endeavors to rescue their frienus. Yet, despite these kind-hearted manifestations, be would not reveal his features.
For over an hour the storm continued to rage in all its fury. Finally it began to break awav, .nd by midnight the heavens were dear and tho stars were shining bright and sparkling. The moon came up, ana then Death-Notch turned to the Young Avengers, and said:
"Friends, the storm is over. We are only about ten miles from the Indian village, anil if we remain here any longer, the savage, or whoever it was that attempted my life a while ago, will bring the whole Sioux tribe ujxin us."
“• Then wo had better not delay a moment in seeking other quarters.” said Fred Travis.
The little band at onoe proceeded to act upon Fr*d’« suggestion, and procuring their weapons, they left the deserted hut. It was, however, with great difficulty that the three wounded vouths journeyed through the forest without assistance.
Denth-Notch advised them to proceed at once ! to Stony Cliff, where the wounded would be safe and receive the proper attention. The village was some fifteen miles awav, and acting upon the masked youth's advice, they bent their footsteps in that direction.
The Scalp-Hunter was to accompany them several miles, when his homeward course would lead him in another direction.
As they moved slowly onward, guided bv Omaha, Fred and the mysterious Deatb-Notcli followed on a short distance tietnnd, conversing in low tones. They had journeyed in this manner several miles when those in front discovered that Fred and Death-Notch were nowhere In sight or hearing. So they stopped and waited for them several minutes, "but they did not come up.
Mbanwhilo they were startled by what seemed to be the report of a pistol. The sound was behind, though some distance away.
There was something singular about Fred’s absence and about that shot. What did it all mean > Surely they bad not got into trouble with a band of skulking Indians, or other sounds would have been heard. W as it possible that Death-Notch had dealt foully with Fred I
The Avengers sent Omaha back to investigate. But he soon returned and Fred was not with him His face wore a clouded expression that spoke louder than words to his companions.
Fred Travis co<ild not be found !
CHAPTER VHL
THE HIDDEN RANCH*.
Fon more than a century past, white renegades, outlaws and prairie pirates have been one of tlie most active elements of evil of the frontiers. and have been almost as detrimental to tho advancement of civilization as the red-man him-self.
They are usually composed of a class of men who, having become the dregB of moral society and not being able to live without violating the law. at their country, flee from the vengeance of that law to the frontier, where they can-have ample scope for their wicked inclinations. And here within the dominions of the red.man, they gather into bands, and although there may be a sextain code of honor among themselves, that hsoor does not extend beyond their own dens.
In their piratical raids npon the settlement* and emigrant parties, these freebooters are seldom. actuated by cupidity, but men togive action to their reckless aad destructive spirit, nsssdhard or likely to be naught, they have
a welcome resort of safety under the strong arm of the red-ekms, whose will they always aim to keep so pliable that it will readily bend to their awn purposes.
The country in and., about Stony Cliff was infested with a bond of these prairie freebooters, led by a notorious scamp called Pirate Btul.
The depredations of this band had been less frequent at Stony Cliff than any other settlements along the river below, and for over a year Pirate Paul had roamed over a goodly portion of the western territory, creating as much fear and excitement, almost, among the settlers as Inkpaducah and his hast. But, what was most smgnlur about this pirute band, it could never be traced to any den or stronghold, and their ubiquity seemed marvelous. However, it was generally believed that their hcad-quarters were somewhere In the vicinity of Stony Cliff. They had been traced by experienced scouts to the river’s bank within a mile of the village. Here they had always taken to the water and further traces of them could not be found. It was very strange, too, whore they went to. In fact, the whole thing was clothed in a bit of mystery that the shrewdest detective and most skillful scouts could not solve.
In the meantime. Pirate Paul was apprised of every movement they made, and laughed to scorn their every attempt at finding him. Bv a systematic procedure, and the assistance of a tittmber of able spies, he was always ready to defeat their plans: and upon on« occasion he managed to implicate his pursuers as the real robbers, themselves.
On the night following that of the storm, a numl>er of the settlers of Stonv Cliff were met in consultation with several settlers of Clontorfs Post—a settlement some fifteen miles down the river.
The settlers of the latter place had, on the night before the- storm, sustained a heavy' robbery, and on the night of the storm two or three jiersons had been robbed at Stony Cliff.
The settlers of Clontarf had tracked the robbers within two miles of Stony Cliff, when the storm came on and obliterated every sign of their trail.
The two parties were met in order to take some stops for a more general and thorough search for Pirate Paul s den than had ever been made.
But, at the same time that the settlers were in council, Pirate Paul and his men, numbering in all fifteen, were in council, also. The apartment in which these freebooters sat was a spacious subterranean room, lieanng the handiwork of the great Architect of the Hills.
It is the hour of midnight when we would conduct the reader through mijws of tangled forests, and dark, echoless hill chambers into the hidden ranche of Pirate Paul,
Around a rough deal table upon which were cards, dice, bottles and glasses, we see the rob-tiers sitting. Each of them, for some reason or other, has a red head-band around his brow. To this is attached a small, white vail that hangs down over the face, so that we cannot see the features. Upon each of these vails we.see a red figure, and by these figures the robbers know each other instead of their names. TMy seem to adhere to method and form—a form as old as that of the Senatorial Council of the I Ionian Inquisition.
Pirate Paul was known as Number One, and the flaming figure upon his vail told which the captain was. They sat around the table in the order of their numbers. One being first; and although there were but fifteen present, the last number was Seventeen. Why was thisf Glance around that circle of form aiid you will see that Seven and Ten are missing.
They are not boisterous in their conversation. They speak in guarded tones, as though afraid of being overheard. Cards and dice seem to occupy the minds of the robbers as we enter: but as the moments wear on, they hear a clear young voice say:
Number Ten seems to be detained for some reason or other."
“ Give him time, Captain Paul." said Number Three. ‘‘You know lt’B a long way to Stonv Cliff."
A low, half-suppressed laugh followed this remark.
•• Probably the settlers are on the alert, or some one is at the cabin, and can't get away,” said Five. “ Never fear. The spy will be here at the proper time."
“ Yes. if he hasn't turned traitor, like El Pardou ” said Six.
"In that case," replied Pirate Paul, “we’ll serve him as we did Pardou: take him to the woods and hang him, and put Death-Notch's stamp upon him. But then I think we need havo no fear.”
“ Not a bit o’ It,” growled Thirteen, “ for he’s oomin’ th*. blessed mlnit. ”
True enough, footsteps were heard descending a flight of steps, and a moment later the person in question appeared in their midst, with vailed fao*.
It was tho spy, Number Ten.
“ Well, you’re bock at last,” said Pirate Paul.
“ Back,” was the laconic reply of Tea.
“Aay cew. r
“ Lots of it The settlers have been in deliberation as to Pirate Paul and Co. The Cion, tarfers are terrible wrothy over that llttls affair.”
“Ah! what else f"
“Say that Scott 8hirely, the Hudson Bay agent, has discovered and revealed to Bvlveen Gray the fact that her lover, Ralph St. Leger, is Pirate Paul.”
Again the robbers laughed.
“Goon, Ten; what else Tasked the impatient chief.
“ They blame Death-Notch of El Pardou’* death. Thev say the Gregory family have sums little cash and Valuables. The search for our ranche will begin just as soon as Scott Shlrelgr and a party of his trndere and trappers return from the Omaha county, where they're gone for peltries. The seven Young Avengers, under the Friendly Omaha, are still at the Cliff, though thev are vet in a terrible stew about their captain, Fred Travis, I think they call him. They’ve been searching all day for him ; they think h. has fallen a victim to Death-Notch.”
" Well," said Pirate Paul,’' we’ll have to lay quiet for a while. At least, until that general search for our ranche is over with; and we had lietter arrange it so as to take a part in the search. But while those avengers are about, we’ll have to be careful. That Omaha is a cunning chap, with an eye like a cat and a nose like a hound. After all is quiet, well wait on the Gregory family and see about their cash and valuables.'’
After some further remarks the council of robbers broke up. The vailed men arose from their seats, and sought their couches in various parts of the cavern. Pirate Paul and Number Ten. however, still remained in a private consultation.
“Now, Finchley," said the robber chief, when thev were alone, :' tell me what you learned of Sylveen Gray—whether Scott Shirely is likely to win her from her robber-lover, 'Ralph St. Leger."
“ It's hard tollin'. capt'in. Miss Gray is no fooL True, Shirely told her that you, capt'in, war Pirate Paul—that is. Ralph St Leger. but she don't seem to believe it. She and Mirs Martha G-egory are thick as a swarm of bees, and I heard Miss Martha tell her that she did not liks the looks of Scott 8hirelj .’'
“ What kind of a looking girl is that Gregory r1
Young—about twenty. She’s handsome, and got sweet blue eyes, pretty ripe lips, and a heavenly form."
“Quite a vivid description," laughed Jurats Paul; “but what seem* to be her objection to Shirely T'
“ Don’t know. Acts us though shc-i- kuovo him before.”
Pirate Paul started, and Finchley noticed that he became uneasy.
“Finchley," he at length said. “I want you6» keep a close watch upon the movements of that girl She may be an enemy of mine, and at-tempt to defeat my moetings with Sylveen Gray. If I find that such is the case, then will I do what 1 have long contemplated: carry Sylveen away by force, and compel her to wed me.”
“ I'll keep a watch out, Capt’in Ralph.” returned the robber-spy.
“Then hasten back to the Cliff, and aprriss me from time to time of the movements of the settlers. ”
“ All square. Cap. Good-night," replied the spy: and rising from his seat, he glided away through the cavern like an eel.
Pirate Paul, the young robber chief, now sat alone, and he at once became deeply absorbed In thought. As the moments wore on, he rested his elbow on the table and his bead on his palm. In this position be fell asleep.
Something like half an hour bad passed, when a figure wrapped in a blanket, with a white vail over the face, stole on tip-toe from the shadows of the cavern toward the sleeping robber. When within reach of him it stopped, and from the folds of the blanket put out a small, white
It was a woman’s hand, without a doubt. Carefully it lifted the vail that covered the face of Pirate Paul, and the figure gazed upon tbs handsome features of the robber, expreet-loolees in slumber.
For a moment the figure remained thus, apparently transfixed by the face of the young pirate-chief; then it turned and glided away i» the direction it had come.
And Pirate Paul slept on.
CHAPTER IX.
▲ BLOW HI THE DARK.
Lot us now return and look after Fred Travta, whom we left with Death-Notch, In a preceding chapter
The young captain and the mysteriouf Soalp-Hunter followed on without hairing of Uraaha and the Avengers, conversing without restraint upon the dangers that surrounded them.
" Then, can you not go to Stony dfll witk usf” Fred oskeo.
“ No. Travis," he renlied. with that usoal tami^rity of the backwoodsman. 11 1 hat*
XUM
taS>n upon m™lt an oath never to enter a -white settlement until I hare unburdened my heart of Its load of vengeance. Besides, there Is another person in this worl 1 claiming my presence ana protection."
“ Ah! a wife, or sister, perhaps?” thought Fred, but he did not give expression to his thoughts. He did not wish to appear inquisitive, so evaded the subject by at once introducing another.
They moved on, conversing in low tones; but Fred noticed, finally, that Peatb-Notch's voice was changing—that he spoie in a quick, excited tone. At length ho came to a sudden halt, and said-.
“My God. Travis! It is coming on me again! (Jo on and leave me. I might—”
"■What is the matter, Death-Notch*” asked Fred, startled by the unearthly expression of bis voice, and the dull scintillation of his eyes through the holes of his mask.
“ I am going mad, Tracis, mad!" replied Death-Notch. grasping a limh. as if for support. “ Oh God' sucn a passion is awful. It is not one of physical or mental debility, hut a fit—a fit of revenge. I can not keep it back. Go. leave me, quick—quirk. Travis 1"
“ But. Death-Notch let me stay and take care of you. ”
“Ho! ho! a legion of demons couldn't hold me. You have been with me already too long When I am away from all white faces, save herv, then 1 am human, unless a savage is about. But faces that are white and voices like my own recall days that are gone—they excite me—put that awful devil in my heart! Go, Travis, go, go, n<>r
Filled with that species of terror which one experiences when in the presence of a madman, Fred, in obedionco to the strange youth’s request. turned and pushed rapidly on in pursuit of his friends; though he was loth to leave the mysterious Death-Notch alone, for fear harm would befall him while laboring under his violent attack of madness.
During his halt with the youth, Fred had permitted quite a distance to grow lietween him and his friends: and now, as he fled onward from the mad Death-Notch, he suddenly became aware that he wasoff their trail. Still he pressed m, in hopes of coming up with them soon; but !n this he was disappointed He stopped-and listened for them, but he could hear nothing. He was in the act of calling to them, when the quick, heavy tread of moccasined feet broke upon his ears. He supposed at once it must be Death-Notch following him. and as he diil not wish to encounter the mad youth, nor use severe means of protection against him, lj'' ;>jx*d on toward Stonv Cliff. StiD. that ominous footstep sounded behind him, and he renewed his exertion*; yet, despite his efforts, his pursuer gained upon him each moment.
At length he felt his strength beginning to fail, and that swift patter, patter of feet filled him with terror. It was a precarious situation to be thus pursued bv a friend—a mad, crazy friend—who was seeking his life—the life he had been instrumental in saving at the deserted l»it. Travis pressed every nerve into the effort, and exerted himself to the utmost. But, steadily, those pursuing feet came nearer and nearer.
Fred turned at last, and drew his pistol.
“ Back I back!” he shouted; “is it you, Death->»otoh!"
“Yes! vesl” echoed an unearthlv voice.
Fred raised his pistol on the shadowy form he saw approaching through the undergrowth.
He pressed the trigger as it came nearer There was a flash and a sharo report.
Still the figure came on. Tae bullet hail missed its mark.
Fred grappled with the form. A sharp struggle ensued, but it lasted only for a moment.
Then young Travis snnk unconscious under a crushing Mow upon the head. Had Death-Notch ifealt that blow?
CHAPTER X.
A MIDNIGHT DRAMA.
The hour was midnight. The Little Sioux river, swollen by the recent rain, was plunging madly on, bearing upon its turbulent, throbbing bosom immense bodies of driftwood and debris.
There was a sullen roar of the waves as they beat and churned themselves to a foam, in their mad endeavors to break beyond the confines of thnir channel. This, however, they will soon do—in lees than an hour—when the little, over-gorged streams have poured their united mites into tho roaring rivor.
Forth from the deep shadows of the woods bordering the stream, there suddenly emerged a human form, bearing in its arms a heavy, lifeless object. Upon the bank of the angrv river the figure stopped, and gazed up anil down for sevoral moments.
Hard by lay a large log upon which the figure finally dejKsitod its burden. Then it busied itsttf for some time around the log, apparently ang»ged m lashing the object to it.
Ten minutes later, no sign of life was there. The mysterious figure had vanished into the fflhomy shadows of the woods.
Then followed an omincus silenoe that was tooken only by the msh and roar of the river. Bat as tile minutes wore cm. a sharp berk sud-
denly issued from the solitude of the woods. Then, forth from the dark, deep shadows of the tangled forest came a grim, gaunt wolf.
Tbe prowling brute stole near the log upon which the figure had deposited its burden, and sniii'od and snaried around it, then, as with affright, ■ scampered away into tho Bhadows of the wood again.
But it soon returned; nor was it alone. A dozen of its grim, gray associates came along.
Around tne log the wolfish pack began to gather, as if preparing for a hanquet. Their sharp harks and loDg howls awoke the silent echoes for miles, and called other friends trooping to the spot.
Soon a score of dark, shaggy forms were seething and plunging lie a vortex about the log.
Why were they there! What quarry were they about to attack)
Still they continue to close around the log, nearer and nearer, their glowing eyes scintillating like bends of fire floating athwart the darkness. At last one of the brutes ventures to shut his glittering teeth upon the object upon the log. but at the same instant they all recoil like a receding wave, and a groan—a human groan issues from the center of that circle of ravenous beasts.
A human being is lashed upon the log! Who was it I And who with the heart of a demon hnd been bo cruel as to put a fellow-lieing in such an awful position?
The wolves soon recover from thoir affright. They rally, and again begin circling around the log, gradually closing in toward it. They are cunning, and feel their way with caution.
Another groan bursts from the lips of the unfortunate being. Again the wolves recoil, but they soon close in again. They are growing bolder. They are closing for the attack.
The doomed man—for man it is—seems to understand his danger. He struggles to free himself : he tries to break the thongs that hold him down; he hears the roar of the river hard by: and now he feels their hot breath upon his cheek; he cannot defend himself—he can only cry to Heaven for help. But he seems deserted by all—even Heaven. For now a huge beast fastens its fangs upon his arm. and tears at tho tender, quivering flesh.
Oh, what a piteous cry bursts forth ui>on the air! But, there is no pitying ear to hear it. The wolves have nothing to fear. They seem to know it, and close in for their feast.
But hark! what thunderous noisef It comes like the txjoming roar of breakers dashing over a stony reef. It is water! The swollen waves of the river have broken from its banks, and are sweeping madly along the shore in one mighty, resistless flood, bearing everything before it.
The wolves utter a cry of affright. They turn from the object of their banquet to flee. But they are too late. The flood grasps them up in its strong embrace, and they are carried away on its foaming bosom. But they are not alone. In their miilst, tossing and rolling 111 Kill the torrent, is that human form irtiil lasliecl to the log
CHAPTER XI.
A WHITE. WHITE FACE.
The scene changes. It is midday. The sun looks down from a clear sky. The air is cool and bracing, and comes laden with a fresh perfume. sweet as the delicious fragrance of Araby or Ind. The forest is redolent with its songs of nature—who has not board them in the wilderness f
It was like walking through a wildwood just from the hands of the Creator to traverse that forest, whero, but the night before, the storm-winds wrestled with the giant trees, and where death and mystery stalked abroad And the river, which had broken from its confines and rushed and roared across the lowlands, had spent its fury and might, and sunk back within its channels.
Not a sound could be heard nor a living object seen. The place seemed tenantless—on uninhabited solitude—unpressed by the foot of man or beast—a hallowed temple, «r the home of invisible spirits.
But this was not the case. There was life within the forest and upon the river.
As the sim declined westward from Ills noontide meridian, a small bark-eanoe shot suddenly out into the river from the mouth of a little creek, over whose waters tho dense foliage formed a dark, green archway.
In the little craft was seatod a maiden, who had scarcely passed her sixteenth summer. She was a being of rare loveliness—sylph-like in form and feature. Her eyes were dark and lustrous, and shaded by long silken lashes. A wealth of dark hair was gathered back from a brqw of Grecian mold and permitted to flow in rippling waves down over her snowy neck and shoulders.
She was dressed in a frock reaching only to her knees, and made in a style hamioniztag with her form and beauty. A little straw hat. probably the labor of her own hands, crowned her head*
Before her lay a small silver-mounted rifle,
while in her belt she wore a small stiletto-liiel knife
Mho handled the paddle with great skill and. dexterity, anil sent the little craft flying up tho stream, keeping within the shadows or the postern bank.
A bright, healthful glow was upon her soft, rosy cheeks, and a sparkling light in her dark eyes.
Lightly the little canoe danced over the waters, while its fair occupant kept a close watch around her, as if expecting some one, or as if on the look-out for danger. She continued to paddle her canoe on up the stream, never permitting her vigilance to rel^ for a moment.
At length her eye was arrested by a number of dark specks sailing in the air, some distance up the river. They were buzzards. And the forest beauty knew that their presence waa attracted there by something below—something that promised them a feast.
They might be only following a party of sav. ages lute the sneaking wolf, for by instinct these birds have loarned that the trail of a war-party is invariably marked with bloodshed and deserted quarry.
The muidcn permitted the canoe to come to a stand while she watched the circling birds. She saw at once they were coming closer and closer, and seemed to be following the course of the liver She felt satisfied that it was soineobject on the bosom of the stream that the filthy birds were following. It might be a lifeless carcass, or. perchance a convoy of savages going down the river. Ssartled by the last thought, and grasping the paddle firmly, she ran her canoe close in shore, and concealed herself under the drooping willows in a little cove, from whence she could still command a view of the river, some distance above.
She saw the buzzards still approaching—at times almost settling down to the tree-tops, then starting up again as if with affright. She now felt sure thev were following a part}- of Indians, und listened intently to catch the dip of their iiacldles, or some sound that would confirm her belief.
But she heard nothing. The birds came closer and closer—now so clear that she can see the lr t>ald heads and naked coral necks bent downward toward the bosom of the river.
Something is there. She can see it rounding the bend of the stream above her. It was a large log floating on the surface. As it comes nearer, a cry burets from the lips of the forest beauty, and horror is stamped upor her fair, sweet face. Upon the log sne sees a human form !ashod. It in tho form of a man It is bound upon the back, while the white, white face is staring heavenward. But there i* no motion in it. It is lifeless!
CHAPTER Xn.
AN AITOEL OF MKRCT.
Like a graven image, the forest beaut)- sat with eyes Axed on the terrible sight before her —a man, apparently dead, and lashed upon a floating log.
As the terrible object came nearer, she savr that the unfortunate neing was a white man—* mere youth. His nrms were bent backward, and bound in a painful position. His clothes were soaking wet, and his dark hair was tangled over his head and neck in dripping masses.
Human pity and kindness asserted their power within the breast of the maiden. She knew at once eomo cruel foe had placed that unfortunate youth there, and she resolved to free him. Butwould it be of earthly use? Wu he not lievond human aid!—dead?
The maiden gazed intently at him for this information. To her horror and disgust she saw a large buzzard settle down on the log, by the motionless head of the youth. Her soul sickened with a strange horror and suspense, for the next instant she expected to see the filthy bird bury its beat in the eyes of the dead. But a thought struck her—she would prevent the mutilation of that fair, boyish face.
She grasped her rifle and drew back the hammer. Just then she saw the vulture crane its neck and peer down into the pale, upturned face before it, with an almost human interrogative look. Then it uttered a startled cry, spread its great somber wings, and rose aloft into the air.
A cry of joy burst involuntarily from tho maiden’s lips. To her the bird’s actions spoka plainer than words. The youth bound upon tha log wax nnl dead /
It did not require a second thought to decide the maiden’s course of action. A few strokes of her paddle carried the little craft alongside of the floating log. She drew the keen little blade from her belt, and hastily severed the thongs that bound tho beautiful young stranger in his awful position.
He was totally unconscious, and it required a great effort of tne maiden to lift his form in her canoe. But she accomplished it with safety, and a murmur of thanks to Heaven Issued fron . her tremulous lips. The next moment she wu driving her canoe rapidly down the river.
She soon came to the mouth of the little creek from which she had debouched into the river, a few minutes before. Up thia gMa
10
archway, swoet and cool as an Airadinn aisle, aha headed her tiny craft, and plied the paddle with all the vigor her delicate frame possessed.
Ever and anon she cased down into the unconscious face before her. It was boyish in feature, yet manly in expression. It was handsome, and -wore a look' of refinement; and the maiden’s heart beat wildly and joyfully in an-
(tidpation of the moment when those eyes would open and those pale lips speak to her.
On sho drove the canoe. She had traveled over half a mile, when she turned abruptly to ttte left, and entered the mouth of another stream. This she followed through dark forest and under tangled foliage for some fifty rods, when sho suddenly burst into a little sunlit glade, in the center of which stood a little vine-embowered cabin.
i It was a lovely sppt—a miniature paradise. Flowers grew on every side, while the whole was compassed on all sides by the dark, green forest.
Running her canoe ashore, tho maiden landed, and, tripping along the little glade, entered the cabin 'dth a familiarity that, told it was her home. In a moment she’returned, followed by a young man whose features bore a striking resemblance to her. It was the youth that met Sylveen Gray the day previous, near Stony Cliff. It was Ralph St. Leger]
His face did not look so brieht as when we first saw him. It was a little pale ami tiaggard, and his eyos were heavy and hollow, as tnough he had just recovered from a spell of sickness.
“Where did you find the young man, sister Vida?’’ asked Ralph, as together they crossed the glade.
“On the river, Ralph, lashed to a floating log. Some person must have had a demon’s heart to bind him there. He is so voung and handsome, and I know he Is not a bad man.”
Thoy came to the canoe, and as Ralph St. Leger gazed down upon the face of the unconscious youth in the canoe, his lace turned very pale, and he started 6lightlv. Bat his sister did not notice his emotion. She was too absorbed in emotions of her own over the young stranger's welfare.
“ An I a stranger” said St. Leger.
•* Yes," responded Vida, "and think you there is any hopo ror him?”
"There may be. I will carry him to the cabin, and we must do all we can to restore him to life.”
Ralph stepped into the canoe, and lifting the unconscious young stranger in his strong arms, carried him to the cabin and placed him on a soft coach.
“Now, Vida." said Ralph, “ von will have to be spry. Well have to labor long and hard to bring him to life. While I chafe the limbs and bathe his brow, you prepare some strong herb tea for stimulants. I see. little Vida, the handsome face of the stranger has awakened a wonderful interest in your young heart."
Tears of joy gathered in Vida’s eyes. The long lushfla drooped upon the olive cheeks, and a crimson flush bwept over her pretty face. She mmfa no reply to her brother’s remark, but turned away and was soon busy in another apartment, preparing stimulants for the young, unconscious stranger.
CHAPTER xm.
A If*W EXISTENCE.
When Fred Travis recovered from the stunning blow, which he was sure had been dealt him by Death-Notch, he first became conscious of the fact that he was lying upon a soft couch, while dark walls surrounded him. He could not recall his situation. His senses were confused bewildered, his brain was feverish and excited. Weird visions of demons were flitting before his eyes, and now and then he could see a colossal shadow pass before him.
He was conscious of existence, ytt he was in doubt as to the state of that existence. His surroundings did not seem of earth. He had Surely pasBed into another sphere. His senses Struggled to assert their former power, but •something like a vague charm held them asunder —a charm that no effort of his own will could break.
But, suddenly, a sound like that of a footstep broke upon his ear, and that strange spell was broken, and reason with Fred Travis Bad asserted its throne. He started up and gazed In oonfnsion around Him He felt of his aching, throbbing head. A bandage was upon it.
Bat where was he? He gazed around the room in which he lay. It was almoet dark, yet be was enabled to see its outer walls were made of logs. Before hhn hung a'curtain that separated his room from one more commodious. He drew aside tbe curtain and looked out into the apartment. He started with surprise. The room Kras flooded with die light of day and furnished ■w?th the elegance of an Oriental boodoir! /The Walls were covered with woven hangings of a rich, harmonious color that formed a beautiful Dockground for tbe pictures that 'adorned it. The floor was oovered with a carpet of ruri-ously-wrought material that looked like Spanish BMW woven in with silken threads. There was u table in one corner upon which were books of
various kinds, and a vase of flowers that diffused their sweet perfume through the room. A beautiful cornucopia hung upon the wall and was filled with fragrant flowers and fruits fresh from the wildwood. Upon a low ottoman near a little window lay a stringed musical instrument.
Fred Travis was dumbfounded. He could scarcely believe the evidences of his own eyes. Whoso home was he ini Surely he had been transported to some other realm. No wildwood home could be so comfortable and luxurious as that
He starts. He bears a soft footstep entering the room. He drops the curtain, and lays back upon the couch. He sees a shadow flit Heroes the curtain, it was the shadow of a wuinan. Was it an angel i He had scarcely asked himself the question when the Bound of made broke upon his ears, sweet, harmonious and dulcet41ke in its strains. Some one was playing upon the instrument be had seen lying upon the ottoman. Tbe air was solemn and mow, and awakened ever?' emotion in tho. young man’s breast. He listened to the music entirely enraptured. Suddenly the clear, sweet voice of a woman entered into the melody with a harmonious accompaniment, anil to Fred it seemed- as though an angel's voice was pouring out its inspirations in one holy, enchanting strain. He listened for several moments. The music had now descended to one of those low, j dying chords which the ear devours so eagerly, and he could no longer resist the desire that tempted his heart. He lifted one comer of the curtain, and gazed, unobserved, upon the sweet, { fair face of the young singer, Vida St. Leger. | For fully a minute he feasted his eyes upon j her form and face, his very soul entranced, not < only by the rapturous melody of her voice, but the loveliness of her features.
At length he sunk back upon his couch, his ' heart in a tumult of emotions. And now his mind became actively engaged in thought. Somewhere he had seen that fair face before. Was it not in his dreams? He thought long. One by one he recalled the incidents of the past two days.	j
He started suddenly with a strange shudder. It was tho same face as that of the youthful , horseman that he and his friends had'seen the day before, galloping through the woods in male attire—the same whom Omaha had said was Death-Notchl But. that such a fair, delicate creature could , bo so terrible a being as the voung Scalp-Hun-ter, seemed utterly preposterous. But, who , was she? Surely not a demon in angel disguise.
At last the music ceased. Then Fred heard ] her footsteps approaching him.
The curtain was drawn aside, and the eyes of Vida St. Leger met those of her invalid protegr.	I
She started slightly on seeing his eyes were open, and gazing up’ into hers with a conscious hght; but, quickly recovering from her sudden I emotion, she said:
“ You are better, I see. young stranger.'’
Her voice thrilled Fred’s heart with renewed strength and hope.
“Indeed, fair maiden,” he replied, rising to his elbow, “ I knew not until a few minutes ago that I was in existence since I was stricken > down in the forest. But, how came 1 here?”
“ Are you strong enough to hear a long story F \ ida questioned.
“ Yes,” he replied, “ I feel strong as ever.” Vida then seated herself near his couch, and narrated to him the terrible position in which she found him; bow she had rescued him from the log and carried him home in her canoe, and how, for the remainder of that day and the night that followed, she and her brother had stood over him and labored to rekindle the spall of life that still lingered within his body.
Fred was astounded by her narrative. He knew nothing of the terrible ordeal through which he had passed after he was beaten down on the night of tho storm. It was well that he did not
In the kindest of word* he thanked and | blessed Vida for her goodness of heart toward j him. The v talked on—one subject led to another, and finally Vida asked:
“ How came you to b« beaten down uncon- I scious in the woods? Surely it was not done by an Indian, or he would never have left his work undone, nor taken the trouble to tie you to a log and send you adrift.”
“ You have heard of Death-Notch, the young Scalp-Hunter, have you not ?” Fred asked.
Vida grew pole, and fear seemed to take possession of her.
“Yes,” she replied, “I have ofttimeeheard of him, and the name fills me with terror.” ' “It was he that beat me down.” said Fred, and he watched the face of the maiden closely.
A little cry burst from her line.
“ Death-Notch is a terrible being,” she said.
“ I have never seen him, but within a.stone’8 throw of our cabin his terrible death-notch is on two or three trees, under which brother Ralph ; found the lifeless bodies of Indians. I fear hhn more on brother's account than my own, for he i is away bo much of the time.”	i
“ Is your brother n hunter and trapper ?”
“Oh, sir! she exclaimed, as with a suddnj pang, “ I wish you had never asked me thfj question.n
"I beg a thousand pardons, dear girl," Said Fred, apologetically ; “you need not answer uv question if ft is distasteful to you.”
“I would like to answer the question if T could,” Vida replied sadly, “ but my brotherls calling is unknown to me. He himtsand traps, it is true, but only sufficient for our sustenance. I am afraid that there is something he is keeping concealed from me. He is away from home most of the time, and when I ask him where hs bar been, and about his success, he evides both questions. But he is the only friend I have, and I love him with all the fervor of a sister1! heart, and I know he loves me. During th* eight months we have dwelt here in this secluded spot, yon are the first person who has been in our house besides ourselves ; and yoors Is the first white face, besides brother’s, that I. have seen for months, although the settlement of Stony Cliff is only twenty miltw from here. But I am afraid to go there.
“Why go?” asked Fred.
“ I love my brother, as 1 said before. And i have a' suspicion of what he follows, and to you I shall confide my suspicions.”
“You can do-so, dear girl, with perfect safety. Not one word will I breathe to a living soul I would not—I-could not betray the ^*^3 that rescued me from death.”	,
•	.“Oh, thank yonl th*nk youP die cried, joyfully. ■■ “ It is so nice to have one in whom you can confide; and I hope brother will yet away the secret which I'feel certain is connected‘with his absence. My suspicions, howev®, are that he iB one of Pirate Paul's robbers, if he is not Pirate Paul himself.”
“What have you upon which to base your opinion, besides his refusing to account for his constant absence from home?” asked Fred.
“■ I have found letters in his pockets directed to Pirate Paul, but written in cipher. But, hark I J hear a footstep. Brother Is coming r She uropped the curtain and turned aside, while Fred again lav down upon his couch.
Then he heard the door swing open and a footstep cross the threshold. He heard the stater's kind and welcome greeting and a Then he heard the brother say:
“ Yon are looking both troubled and pleased, my little sister. Why is it? Is not your handsome young patient better r Fred did not hear her answer, for that voice froze his blood almost with terror.

CHAPTER XIY. the moio Rina.
They met at their old trysting^plaee—Ralph St. Leger and Sylveen Gray.
Ralph was looking a little pale and toilwom. while Sylveen's face wore a bright «mtl« ana her heart was throbbing wildly under the emotions of anxiety and fear—anxiety to test the power of the ring which Martha Gregory had given her, and a fear that it would prove her handsome boy-lover a prairie pirate, as Scott Shirely had declared him to be.
After their first greeting, Sylveen said:
“ You look tired and exhausted, Ralph.”
“I am a little tired, dear Sylveen," the youth replied. “ 1 have traveled fir th<« mors.
"Just to meet me, Ralph?” queried the maiden, a tender light beaming m her eyes.
“ Yes, sweet Sylveen. To keep my promise ; with you. I would let nothing netf, m me, un- i leas it was death. ”
“ You are very true to me, deer Ralph.

CHAPTER XV.
RED ELK ON THE WAR-PATH.
: Tice wildest excitement prevailed within the fcduin village when it became known that Death-Notch had been in thoir midst—in their Jouncil-lodge: had stricken down one of their leaders, ana Wien fled on tho horse of Le 8ubtile Vox
~ The body of the young chief. Red Antelope. Whom those in the council-lodge supposed the terrible Death-Notch to be, Was soon brought In. He was scalpless, and bore tho drath-notch of his slayer.
The fury of the savage band became great. They surged to and frc like maddened beasts. They uttered their fearful war-cries and grap-fplea with imaginary foes.
;*• It was some time before Inkpaducah could restore order and assemble his chiefs in council •gain. When ho did, however, Le Subtile Pox was still among them, feeling thankful that Death-Notch had let him off with no further loss than that of his horse.
j? The old chief addressed the council with all the eloquence of which he was master. He portrayed in vivid colors the destruction that ’Death-Notch was visiting upon his people. He invoked their immediate vengeance.
\ His hearers responded in cries that asserted 1 their readiness for action.
E. Lo Subtile Fox also addressed the assembly in Uk few pointed remarks that seemed to nave .(nore influence upon the savages than the chiefs 'speech. This was probably because the chief &ad stuck to the truth, while the wily renegade •had soared away into eloquent falsehoods, so ilBadlly devoured Dy the Indian warriors.
(- Lo Subtile Fox remained at the village until (Jie had accomplished his mission, and learned .the course the Indians intended to pursue; then he took his departure from tho place.
^ The night wore away, and on the following '•TBoming several war-parties wore dispatched in gUl directions to assist the party already absent lender Sleepy-Eyes in the search for the terrible •foath-Notcfi.
i‘ But before night one of the parties returned l.'Vith the remnant of the young chiefs party, |lnd the body of the young chief himself, jf From the lips of the warriors the Indians ns&raed of tho conflict at tho deserted hut where |Sle«ny-Eyas was Blaln. They also recoived a (confirmation of Le Subtile Fox’s story of a new Sfoe, calling themselves the Eight Avengers, Hieing in tne country. And terrible foes they Rhreatened to be, for tho affair at the deserted Kbot was their first blow, and Sleepy-Eyee their Bflrst victim.
K; “War, war to the knife! Vengeance! von-wpancer were the cries that passed from lip to asp of the savage foe; and the following morning SK dozen different parties were sent forth in every Mirection. One under the daring chief, Red Elk, SJfas sent down tho rivor toward Stonv Cliff to intercept the Eight Avengers, if possible.
His warriors numbered about a score, and Btrere the flower of the tribe in point of bravery bad physical strength. They were painted and Dunned, until they appeared hideous, and were Krmed with the best weapons in all the tribe.
E These men took their departure on foot, and lifter journeying through the forest until they faameto the river, they changed their direction Hhd fallowed the coarse of the stream.
■v At' a rhpid paco they pushed on, and the day In half gone when thev observed a canoe coni-BSfciipi’tEe river. There was an Indian in it, Hna a	-ssrured the savages that it

11
was a scout who had been sent out from the town a day or two previous.
Red Elk’s party at once made their presence known, and soon the scout was in their midst.
“ What news does Creeping-Vine bring from the camp of our enomiesr asked Red Elk.
“The pale-faoe enemies are abroad. They are called Avengera, and are led by a dog of an Omaha. Death-Notch still prowls through the woods for the scalps of the Dacotah and Sioux.”
“ Has Creeping-Vine seen the pale-faces under the Omahaf”
“He has; and has heard them talk. He lay hid under some old leaves when they broke camp. They are now searching for a friend whom they lost on the night of the storm. They fear Death-Notch struck their friend down.”
“ Then Death-Notch strikes down the palefaces, too?”
“Yes.”
“ Where now are those calling themselves The Eight Avengers?'
“ On the march. To-night they will encamp on the Hunter’s Island, below Eag'le Rock."
“ How does Creeping-Vine know this?”
“ The pale-face lavs out his plans and marks out his course before be starts. I heard the Avengers say where they would encamp tonight. before thev left their camp this morning. " " Then," said Red Elk, a glow of triumph beaming from his small, evil eves, “ liefore another sun rises, the scalp of the Avengers shall hang at tho girdle of Red Elk and his warriors. We will entrap them, as the pale-faces entrap the beaver.”
When the wily chiof liad thus expressed himself. he moved on down the stream toward Hunter's Island, followed by his warriors.
CHAPTER XVI.
OLD SHADOW.
Just at daybreak a little party of seven persons broke camp in the forest south of Stony Cliff, and headed their way up the Sioux river.
It was the Spirit Lake Avengers, now led by the friendly Omaha. Those wounded at the desorted hut had so far recovered as to be able to set forward on their journey again. They had l>een kindly treated while'at Stony Clift, and had received urgent invitations to remain: but the unknown fate of Fred Travis proved a keen spur to their anxiety and impatience, and thev at once set out in search of him.
■They had already hunted the forest through in the vicinity of the deserted hut, and ns they could find no trace of him, they thought he ■night have been taken captive by the Indians ana carried away to their village. If so, they hoped to be in time to Bave him. •
The Omaha being well acquainted with the topography of the country through which they were journeying, they moved with expedition.
At a distance of a good day’s travel from where they broke camp, there was an island in the river, which they aimed to reach ere sunset. But in this they were disappointed. It was dark when a point opposite the island was reached. And now they met with another obstacle between them and the island. For th( want of a canoo some hours would be consumed in constructing a raft. But it was their only recourse. Searching along the bank for drift-logs, they were so fortunate as to find a raft, already constructed, lying lodged against the river bank.
It showed signs of having been recmtly made! A number of old, dry logs had been placed parallel with oach other, and in this maimer lashed together with green barks and withes. The lops were very large—some of them three feet in diamoter. Half of this thickness was submerged in tho water.
At first. Omaha thought there might be something tricky about the raft, but a careful examination sot aside all his fears. As the raft was not made fost, they supposed it had been floated there by the late flood from some point above.
Boarding the rude affair, tho Avengers towed it out into the middle or the river, then permitted it to drop down, at the will of tlia current, against tho upper side of the island, where it could not be drifted away.
Tho island was a small tract of sandy soil, covered with a dense growth of willows. It was elevated several feet above the highest water mark. In tho center was a bare spot of sand, and in the center of this waB a wide, flat stone covered with the ashes of a recent camp-fire.
The island was a favorite camping-place of the hunter, trapper, Indian, or whoever happened to bo journeying in these parts, on account of the natural advantages offered as a protection against the sudden surprise of an enemy; and, at the date of our story, it was known "as Hunter’s Island.
As the Avengers did not deem it safe to strike a fire, they ate their supper from the remnants of thoir morning meal. When the repast was over, Omaha made a careful circuit of the island.
“You think, then, an enemy could not surprise us here?1! asked Meredith,- when the Friendly reappeared.
“No; if an Indian, or any one, can get onto the Island without mo seeing him before he gets
here, then Omaha will give op that he la a better
scout, and—
“Then, laddy, i guess ye’ll have to knock under to yer granddaddy.
The Avengers started to their feet, with sudden surprise and blank astonishment written upon their faces. The last voice was that of a stranger, who bad appeared in their midst as silently as though he had been dropped from the clouds.
He was a tall, lean, lank Individual, of, perhaps, some forty years of age. dressed in a suit of greasy buck-ekm His head was surmounted by a cocn-tikin cap, from which the hair waa worn ofl, and which appeared like a bald poll His face was angular and cadaverous: his nose prominent and slightly Roman, and his gray eyes small, yet glittering like two coals of fire beneath their shaggy brows. His free, careless and reckless air was suggestive of one of the old type of brave, jovial old trappers of the Nor’weet.
He carried a fine-looking rifle, a side tomahawk, a knife and a brace of pistols, and as h» appeared before the band of Avengers, he dropped the butt of his rifle to the ground, and, clasping his hands over the muzzle, assumed an easv. reclining attitude.
For a momei.t our young friends ge&ed upon this odd specimen of humanity in oflonl wonder, and before either of them could speak, he asked:
“ Arn't I a stunner, though?”
" 1 must admit vou are,’1 replied Amos Meredith, confusedly; but who an* you, anyhow?"
•• Wal, I can't say for surtain, as to that,” replied the stranger, with a comical smile; “but I guess I'm a rantankerous ole cuss that’s been rippin' over this little patch o’ yearth called Nor' America for somethin’ nigb on to forty -flve years. I'm a lad o’ leisure and pleasure; hunt a little, trap a little, and spioe the hull now ami then with an Ingin skulp. I’ve no weenrin-folks to cry artei me—oh no—nor wash me duds. I generally wear a suit till they git dirty: then I throw myself into the river and flummix erbout awhile, and come out clean as a new -polished rifle. But, as to my name. If we should continoo to sojourn together, call me enny thing, so ye call me in time for a leg o’ turkey or a hump o' venison. Over or the Platte thev called me Lanky Joe; down on the " Big Muddy" they called me Dagger-Eyes and Rattlejute' and up on the Republican Fork they call me Ole Shader."
"A very suggestive name, considering not only your'anatomy, but the silence with which you appeared among us,” said Frank Harriott.
“And faith, ould feller, let mew ax if there are enuff ave yees to make a shader V said Phe-lix O’Ray.
“ Wal, now, youngster with the boggy tongue, do ye s’poee yer goin' to have a laugh at my expense? If so, alihunky. I like sport like a tortle does sunshine, and I know you’re a jolly set. But I’m just such an old scalp-pole as nature made me, and it’s durned doubtful whether I'd make a shader, or even a grease-spot. if I was rubbed out. But I’m wiry as an oie black-snake: and what Ole Shader’s eyea can’t see ain’t wuth lookin’ arter.”
As he spoke, the old hunter glanced warily toward the upper tide of the island quite frequently. Thif apparent uneasiness did not escape the notice of the young men, and, despite his oddity and boisterous voice, they apprehended that all was not right. But beior* either of them could make any remark or inquiry, the old fellow’s tongue set off again:
I reckon as what ye young cube think I’m a noisy ole rattlepate; but, the fact o’ t is, ttf* second nature to me to keep blabbin’ and clatterin' away like an ole woman or a blue jay. But, then, tliar’s policy in tongue-talk nom«-time*. ’Specially in the present case.”
“What do you mean?’ asked young Meredith. ‘ I see there is aa undercurrent m your conversation.”
"Wal, now, that’s what I’ve been drivin’ at,” said Old Shadow; “and now"—and his voice feU almost to a whisper—“ if ye lads don’t want to lose yer scalps, ye’ve got to git out o’ this quick as wink yer eye."
The Avengers started.
“Are there Indians about?” one of them
asked.
“Bet yer hair on’t So close that one big leap will bring twenty tomahawks onto yer
noggins.”
“You’re surely Jesting!” exclaimed Dick Carter.
“Not a bit o’it. But ye can do list as ye please, boys; but Ole Shader leaves lnstanter. Too hot Tound here fur me—too much brimstone."
“ I can’t see where a foe could possibly be concealed so close to us,” said Frank Harriott. “ But if there are Indians about, we had better take tc the raft and go ashore."
“ Thar’s no need o’ packin’ the red devils with ye, so jist let that raft alone. The three big logs in the center o’ it are holler, and on the under aide o’ thom are a dozen holes, chopped there with tomahawks, and in eveiy hole there is an In gin’s head and neck run up Into tits teller.”

after the conflict at the deserted hat, Bdi then young Travis could not drive from --3 ory’s ear those wild, hoarse notes of the mad inaiL when he—Death-Notch—begged him tt , flee from him in the woods.
Would not Fred's <£ace excite him again, aid throw him into that fearful state of uncontrol lable madness i The thought was anything bffl pleasant to Fred, and he began to think of (2 raping from the cabin. But this he found 1 would be impossible. The cabin had but wfi door, and near this the brother and sister stood] The youth bent his ear and listened. He ; heard them talking, and learned that he ! was the subject of their conversation, j “ Yes, Ralph, he is better,” he heard Vidd say; "he has entirely recovered consciousnei . and thinks he is well as ever. But he- is weaS and must not be disturbed.”
“No. no, Vida,” he heard the brother i* | spond; “he is your patient; you have saved his life so far, and your injunctions must b< strictly regarded.”
“Oh, Ralph!” and Vida’s eyes grew bright , With some inward emotion; but, suddenly membering that Fred was awake, she checked the words that came to her lips, while the dark. silk eyelashes drooped shyly on her flushed | cheeks.
i “ What is it, Vida!” asked Ralph St I*ger. “You are feeling unusually joyous; have yod caught it from the young stranger?”
"m, Ralph!” she said, placing tie tips of hat
; tapering, dimpled fingers to her brother’s lips; l " he is awake and may hear you. Come, sit j down You look tired and careworn. Yob , must be hungry. ”
! Ralph St. Leger threw himself upon the otfoi | man while Vida stole softly back to Fred’s , couch, and, drawing aside the curtain, gazed j down upon the youth. He slept I She moved lightly away, and was soon engaged in the preparation of the evening meal! I When it was ready, Fred was still asleep. She i would not disturb his slumber. She would him food when he awoke.
I Ralph eat his supper silently and thought-’ I fully. Vida watched him closely. She saw at | once that something uncommon retted upon his mind; and after supper was over, and the table
1	cleared away, the brother and sister seated themselves near the door, furthest from the invalid’s couch, and entered into conversation.
“ Ralph, dear,” said Vida, “ you are Di trouble. Your very looks and actions say soi: Why is itf”
“Vida, my love was spumed to-day by one whom I loved most dearly."	^	{
" You loved, Ralph i This Is news to me. Yob,’ surprise me."
“ Yes, no doubt sister. But there is k. maiden at Stony Cliff whom I met an4' loved many days ago. And to me sh* pledged her heart and hand, but to-day 6he revoked that pledge and spurned my love. Sheaoj cused me or being Pirate Paul.”
Vida started and uttered a little cry. “Brother,” she said, “I have even thought so myself.”
" My God!" he exclaimed; “ is it possible that you link my name with that of a villain, Vidar!
“ How can I do otherwise, brother? Fw nearly a year have we lived in this secluded spot Your comings and goings have bees wrapped in mystery to me.^You tell ms nothing, unless it is of the terrible deeds of Death-Notch. or of some robbery committed by the prairie pirates. Why have you been » silent, if you did not wish me to couple yoos absence with that of some evil?"
Fred Travis has heaitl every word. He did not approve of eavesdropping, Dut there was * mystery about this brother and sister that he wished to solve. To Vida he saw her brotherV doings were entirely unknown. He had caught a glimpse of Ralph s faoe through the curtain. He saw the resemblance it bore to the maiden’s. ; He was fully satisfied that he was Death-Notch, for, although the Scalp-Hunter had kept his face; masked at the hut, his voice was the sameu that of Ralph St Leger. But might not he be’’ the Pirate Paul, tooF “ Sister,” said Ralph, after awhile, “half of my life is a blank. Ever since our parents were slain by the accursed Sioux, under Le Subtil*1. Fox—since I witnessed the torture and shameful treatment of our mother and sister—I have been insane half of my tim« And were it not. for you, Vida, to soften my heart, to live for, to love, I believe I would go entirely mad. And since Sylveen Gray—she whom I have loved ; with all the affection of a true heart—bit : spurned my love, it seems as though this lift of mine is a bitter one. But, sister, do you remember the ring that mother wore ere our horn* fell under the Bavjujee' blows?"
“ Yes, yes. Ralph. I could never forget it It was a gold ring, with such a curious setting at some precious stone. But what of itl"
“ Sylveen Gray wears that ring.”.
A cry burst from Vida’s lips.
“ It must have been taken from mother bSfajtk her capture,” she said: “but how cam*Mil*. Gray in possession of itr1 “ I know not But when I saw roqognJp*4-it, Sylveen ihrunk from m. as if from lAaddto
“Heavens!" exclaimed Harriott; “is it possible?”
“Verily I say unto ye, it is the case. I soc’d ’em make the raft, and heard ’em talk ’about it, and all what it war fur. They falOlv’J yo wore cornin', and intended to stoa on llunter’s Islaa’. A red varlet they called C.-vepin'-Vine brought 'em the news. Creepin’-Vine overheard you fellers say whar you intended to stop, and I hearn the darned pups settin’ their traps to cotch ye. They left Croepin’-Vine over on shore to give the signal fur wie attack to begin, in case ye war unkoerful enough, as the reds supposed ye would bo, to pack %m over here in that raft But Croepin’-Vine will never give that signal.” As he concluded, the old hunter tapped his girdle in a significant manner. The scalp of Creeping-Vine was dangling there!
“Now,” he continued, “thar’s my canoe. Take it and run yerselfs over to the east shore, then one o’ ye bring it back arter me. ni stay and talk away here like a rip and blazes, and make the dodrotted knaves think yer all sot up with tho extract o’ sod com.”
“ Hadn’t one of us better remain with your asked Meredith- you might got into trouble.”
“ Never mind me, boys. I’m olo groused lightnin’ on a run or swim, and if I wunce git started thar’s no bullet or arrer as can catch me. Sop#, boys, and go easy as a shader.”
The young men took up their rifles, and crossing the island to the lower side, entered the old hunter’s canoe, while the hunter himself sat down and began singing the old familiar border song that ran thus:
. “ The 'possum he grinned at the ole hedgehog,
At the ole hedgehog, at the ol. hedgehog;
The *pos3*.im he grinned at the ole hedgehog,
'Way down by the Squantnm river,” etc.
“ He’s an odd genius,” said Frank Harriott, as they pushed out into the river, and permitted the canoe to drop silently down-stream.
In a few moments they had effected a safe and noiseless landing on tho east bank of the river. Then Omaha returned with the canoo, and brought Old Shadow over from tho island.
“ Yaht haw! haw!” laughed the old hunter,
“ it's a good *un on 'em pizan varlets, by cracky it is! Aud now 1*11 give the signal that Creep-in-Vine, the former owner o’ this ’ere scalp, war to give. A—yi! a—yi!”
As the last two cries echoed through the woods, every eye was fixed upon the raft that lay. plainly revealed by tha moonlight instantly there was heard a fluttering in the wato r, then a score of dark forms were seen to rise I from the stream around the raft, and leap ont> the island with a yell that resounded for miles I and miles.
Across the island they swept, their uplifted I tomahawks gleaming in the moonlight. But I their triumph was soon turned to disappoint- , ment and rage, for they found their enemy was gone—the birds had flown.
Old Shadow chuckled with suppressed laughter, and rubbed his homy palms with glee, and for awhile it seemed as tnoujh he would be unable to restrain his emotions.
CHAPTER XVII.
A VOICE FROM THE FLAXES.
Grasping his tomahawk, every warrior glider away in tne direction from wnence the sounc had come, but when the upper side of the isianc was reached, all was silent as the grave. Upon
■	the raft, however, a tearful signt met tlieii I eyes. The guard was hanging, head downward, I over the edge of the raft, dead. His head was scalpless, and across his cheek was a deep gash. By his side a fresh notch was cut on one of the Iobb!
It was the token of Deatb-Notch, the young Scalp-Hunter.
A yell of terror burst from the red-skins’ lips. They loaped upon the raft and began searching it over for the terrible foe. But, to their surprise, the logs parted and began floating away, compelling them to beat a hasty retreat back to the island. The withes that bound the logs together had been eut asunder by the young Scalp-Hunter, with the intention, no doubt of destroying their chance of escape from the island, without taking to the water.
The doubly defeated savages had not a doubt but that Death-Notch had made good his escape from the island ; nevertheless, they made a hasty search for him, but in vain.
Stung to fury, they gathered around their camp fire again. New fuel was added to the flames. The light leaped out in strong, red beams, and fell with a lurid glow across the grim, demoniac faces of the savages.
Red Elk was the sole embodiment of rage. His expedition, that at first promised so fruitful, was proving a wretched failure. He addressed his warriors in a flerco eloquence, every word of which added new fuel to the fire of their revengeful hearts. It was some time before the storm subsided. Theu, with malignant scowls, they all bent their eyes upon the fire, as if actuated by a single impulse.
Then they "start A low groan issues from the vary depths of the crackling flame. It is human, and seems to jar the flre, for a million sparks went upward from its bosom, as though a stone had been dropped into its center.
Appalled, the savages start back. Another groan issues from the flre. A column of sparks float upward, wavering and crackling hi the currents of air.
The savages start to their feet—recoil.
“It is well, fiends," shrieks a hollow, ghosts like voice.
The burning fagots leap and dance in the fire. The flame waves and flutters spitefully. Sparks, millions of sparks, float upward.
The red-skins stand aghast A spirit was within the flre. It spoke, and crackling (lames and snapping sparks were breathed forth.
The red warriors grow bolder. They now ad-'•anw closer to the flre and begin circling around it, gazing with starting/eves iuto the flame. They see nothing. Mysterious terror fills their hearts.
" Red-skins, whv do you stare at me?" the voice came from the flre! “ I am tho spirit that will consume you when Death-Notch nas hung your scalps at his girdle. I am angry. I tremble.”
The fagots began to leap and quiver on the stone. The flame wavers and the light flickers and flashes. Smoke and sparks float upward.
The savages stand paralyzed with terror. Red Elk has no power of eloquence to break that fearful spell, for he. too. is rooted to tho spot with mysterious awe.
At length there is a calm. The flame gathers strength, and the light flares out on the painted, terrified faces around it
A minute passed.
Again the sparks begin to rise from the flre, and the flame to quiver. The spirit was moving within it Then there was a sudaen crash, ana the. air was Ailed with flying firebrands, red-hot coals and hissing marks. In every direction had the camp-fire been hurled, right and left into the very face9 of the red-skins; then all was darkness.
The savages took to the river, and swimming ashore, fled away into the forest with absolute terror.
Half an hour later a human figure stood in the center of the island. Over the face was an iron mask.
It was Deoth-Notch, the young 8calp-Hunterl At his feet, leading down under the island, was the small mouth of a cavern. The wide, flat stone, upon which the savages had built their camp-fire, concealed the opedtng from their view.
There, in the cavern under the stone, bad Death-Notch been concealed—having entered the cave through a small opening under the edge of the island, where it had escaped the savages’ eyes: and there, under the flat stone, had the young Scalp-Hunter worked upon their fears in the manner we have already shown.
The deep-laid plan for the surprise and massacre of the Lake Avengers, by Red Elk and his warriors, proved a decided failure, and when he found his enemies had escaped, his savage fury knew no bounds.
To have attempted to follow the whites then would have been an act of folly in violation of an Indian’s usual precaution. He suspected the Avenger* had not only outwitted them, but had laid a trap for their destruction. So he resolved to stay on the island till morning, then take up the trail of the enemy , and follow. So guards were pasted on each side of the island, the one that stood on the upper side taking his position on the raft
Owing to the circular form of the island, and the willows upon it, the guards were tumble to see each other from their posts; neither could they be seen by their friends from the center of the island.
Red Elk being beyond rifle range of either shore, order a fire United. He wished to hold a consultation with his warriors, and wanted a light by which to read the expression of each one’s face, and note the impression that his eloquence would have upon them. So, in obedience to his desire, a flre was built upon tho largo, flat stone in the center of the little sand opening.
Soma of the warrior* now filled the bowls on the head of their tomahawks with tobacco, and began to smoke, while others threw themselves la listless, lounging attitudes upon the sand.
Half an hour passed in silence, then Red Elk ipoke. Every warrior rose to a sitting posture and assumed an attentive air.
,' “Braves of the great Sioux, and followers of . Bed 12k,” the chief beyan, with all the dignity •nd eloqaence that he could master, but at this , Juncture there was heard a low groan at the upper ride at the island, followed by two dull, ■oddan blows, and the oration carae-to in abrupt termination.

Fred Travis lay like one under a terrible fascination. That voice fell upon bis ear like the voice of doom. There was no mistaking it It vxu the voice of Death-Notch, the terror of the red'-skin and the fear of the settler.

A low , half-suppressed cry burst from Vid»'; lips and an expression of fear overslindowe.!
■	her features. Ralph's revelations had startle. 1 her Prom his own story she at once believed he 'ras subject to attacks of fits, and yet he had tndeavoreo t > make her believe it was but • >it» mcnt. She felt no uneasiness for herself. lmt for the handsome, invalid youth Ivina behind the curtom. What if her brother should become 'mad at sight of him' As she asked herself tin* quo.st.iou, she glanced uneasily and involuntarily . toward the rurtain. Ralph readily divined her thoughts and fears by her actions, and continued,
' Willingly:
‘ Vou need have no fears for him, Vida. I ie» vour heart has become deeply interested in
i	t youth's welfare.”
• tih. Kal;>h!” she cried, blushing crimson,

•	1 have kept the fact from vou for your own id >1. I know it is an appalling mood that at nines possesses me.”
“ Yes, brothor, and I fear it will be the death »f vou vet,’’ said Vida.
11	God holds our lives In his hands. I am his lervnnt. and as he wills I am satisfied. But. fida, 1 have settled my mind upon one thing.
’ I must sec Sylveen Gray onoe more. I mast
6ring about a reconciliation, if possible. VVith-’ tiut her love, sister, this world ■will be a hall-ilank to me. If she will listen to my story, be-ievo that I am no Pirate Paul, and will renew ’ ter promise to wed me some day, then will I leave this wild, secluded home, wherein love us well as revenge hs keeping me. Once awav from the hateful presence of the Indians, 1 -know this spirit of revenge will be forgotten. Cut I hardly know how to act now.”
“ lialph, I v. ish I could advise you ill your trouble. But, for the sake of your sister, be t careful of your life. When you are gone. I will ( fcave no one to care for me.
! Tears gathered in the eyes of Ralph St. Leger. He drew his little sister'toward him, put back the long, dark ringlets from her brow, and planted a kiss upon it.
'• In the mean time, Fred Travis was an attentive listener to the startling revelations of Ralph . fit. Leger, and tho words of tendorness spoken ty the brother and sister. He felt ashamed of his silence, but he oould not help it.
After a few moments' silence he heard the brother and ulster renew their conversation.
“Brother,” Bald Vida, “ I beliovo now you are JuQt Pirate Paul, but I cannot say I am pleased to know you aro Death-Notch.”
. “I am not pleased over the fact myself, Vida, .but then I feel that I have not been accountable, In a certain sense, for many things that I have aqpne. But, revengo now U only a secondary i£>J>jpct. Love stands pre-eminent—a love that ; strong ere Death-Notch struck his first Wow, and mads his name a terror. However.
if Sylveen Gray will hear my story, and lielieve me—renew her promise to become my wife when we have grown older, then will I give up this life.”
“ Oh. I prav, then, that she will!” cried Vida, hopefully; “ but, Ralph, you say when you are under these mysterious' attacks, you have a faint remembrance of what you ao, yet can not stay your acts.”
“ "i es. such is the case. ”
‘‘Then, do you remember of having beat this young man down in the forest on the night of the storm J”
“ No, Vida, for I did not.”
“ He says Death-Notch beat him down.”
He is mistaken. I was with him that-night, and had one of my attacks. I knew it was coming, and warned him to flee and join his friends. He left me, and I recovered. Soon after I spw three ]>ersons, who 1 concluded were robbers, and still a few minutes later I heard a pistol-shot. I never saw Fred Travis after our i>arting there that night, until I saw him lying unconscious in vour canoe. ”
Fred heard this declaration with a feeling of ioy. A terrible weight was lifted from his heart. He would now have nothing to fear from IVatli-Notch.
By this time it was dark in the cabin: so a lamp wi s lighted. Ralph and his little sister now sought Fred's couch, and finding he had. apparently, just awakened. Vida went to prepare him some food, while ner brother engaged him in conversation, by which Fred soon learned that the young Scalp-Hunter was a person of more thon ordinary intelligence.
Vida’s np]>earance with some food on a snowy plate, anil a bowl or coffee, ended their talk. Fred arose from his couch, and. being seated in an easv-chair. ate the viands brought him with
ii	keen relish. After this repast * felt much refreshed and strengthened, and ventured on a few minutes’ walk anil exercise in the o|*>n air. When he returned. Ralph also was out. but came in, in a few- minutes, looking not a little excited.
The three seated themselves and entered into conversation. Fred sat with his back toward tire ojien door anil facing Ralph, and Vula sat at- one side.
Suddenly. Fred saw Ralph start as though he hnd detected a slight, unnatural sound without, for lie fixed his eves upon the open door.
What is it. Ralphf” asked Fred.
Ralph made no reply. Fred fazed into _his face and saw it was set with the rigidness of death. His white, jiearly teeth shone between Ins slightly mrted lips, and his eyes glowed and scintillated like coals of tire: their pupils dilated until they seemed to cover the whole ball. It w as a terrible expression, not one of madness, nor insanity either, but of—what : Who can tell'
‘•Ralph1 Ralph-” exelaimed Fred, hoping to break the spell that was coming over him lute a seiiieut s fascination.
Ralph made no reply, but. like an arrow.be shot tnrough the cabin door, out into the blinding darkness.
Before either Fred or Vida could s]«ik. there was tieard a low, wail-like cry : theij idl liecame silent again.
A minnte later Ralph made his apix-arance in the door, apjmrently as calm anil composed as he had ever teen.
But Vida sprung backward with a shriek, and jiointing to his girdle, exclaimed:
•	Mv God, Ralph, what is thatr"
CHAITER XIX.
EVIL PACKS.
Ralph St. Leoer started at hi* sister'. « mils, as though be had suddenly been aroused from a dream. He gazed down at his girdle, where he beheld a reeking scalp dangling. TV 1th apparent disgust, he tore the bloody trophy from his Hick and tossed it out of the door.
“The cunning fiend.” said Death-Notch, “got a little too close. I remember seeing him pass the door and peer in when 1 sat there.”
“ Brother. ” said Vida, with trembling voice,
“ I’m so afraid onr home will be discovered by the savages and we slain, for they must be continually on the hunt for Denth-Notcb. Oh, Ralph flet us leave here soon “Your wish shall be granted, Vida: a few more days and we will forever leave this wilderness and' its dangers, God willing. But. for fear there may now be other savages about, I will go out anil reconnoiter. ”
Vida would buve protested against his leaving, but, before sho could speak, be had taken his weapon and left the cabin.
The maiden and her invalid guest waited long and anxiously for his return, but tlie hours stole away, the inoon sunk behind the western tree-tops and dawn appeared in the east before ho retumeid.
When he did his face wore a look of fatigue. It was evident that he had spent the night in ac-
“ brother, you have been gone so very long!” . said Vida; “ are the Indians about!!”
“The woods are swarming with them, and I am afraid they’ll find our homo, alas, too soon ’ But I must keep on tho alert ”
And so he did. During the next two days he was absent from home most of his time—scouting through the woods.
Fred Travis convalesced rapidly, within the sunshine of Vida’s smiles. He walked with her in the cool, silvan wood; rowed with her upon the creek, and talked and sung with her until the emotions that were ripening in their young hearts gushed forth in confessions of love ana jov.
From the moment they had first gazed into each other's eyes, a feeling far deeper than mere friendsliip was awakened in each young heart. This continued to grow upon them, until it at last found expresdon in words of love and da. votion.
To these lovers that solitary cabin seemed 39 Arcadian bower. They thought but little of ths dangers that so troubled the mind of Death-Noteh and kept him on constant watch. Thqje was no vain show nor formality in their loro. It was a pure and holy love in which the noblest' emotions of the human breast held power.
It was near the close of the third day of Fred’S sojourn at the Lone Cabin—as Vida called the place—that the young lovers were seated upon the bank of the little stream which formed the western boundary of the glade.
They had long expected the return of Death-Noteh. and Vida hoa begun to chctfc in spirit at his protracted absence. But Fred spoke words of cheer to her and endeavored to comfort her mind and keep it upon something else. In her lap lay a Spanish guitar, upon which she had been playing for him. and now, as the twilight shadows began to gather over the woodland with their evening voices and solemn inspirations, f>ed asked her to play again.
The maiden took up the instrument and rtruck a s» eet. inspiring air, her own rich voice joining in the melody in a clear, rippling cadence. The music was' delicious, and the beautiful singer modified the tones of her own voice and that of the instrument to harmonize with the soft, vibrant air that carried the sounds away through the forest aisles in strains of ravishing sweetness.
The air was a familiar one to Fred, but he had never heard it sung with such inspiring melody. It brought up recollections of a once-happy home and dear faces that were now no more'. Tears welled up into his eyes, as his thoughts went back over old, sweet memories.
The snowy fingers of the forest beauty flashed over the strings of the instrument unnoticed by tiun. Blit, as her voice rose and fell in those sweet, melodious strains, his breast rose and fell with the emotions it stirred within.
At length the music grew slower and fainter, and finally faded away in silence in a low, dying chord.
Fred raised his eyes to those of the lovely girl. He saw she was sitting motionless as a carved image, her lips slightly jiarted. and her face set with an expression of terror. The guitar wa* in iier hands, and hor fingers upon the strings; but it w-as mute.
Vida's eyes were fixed with a terrified gaze upon the opposite side of the creek, and Fred [►emiitted his own eyes to turn in that direction, and to his horror lie saw the dark green foliage parted in a dozen places, and the grim, painted face of an Indian warrior appeared in each opening
CHAPTER XX.
A Tl’SKET-HUKT.
“ Hr 1.1X1, lads! Git outen this! The sun’s up and shinnin’ it over the hill like sixty, and has tieen for an hour Time for snoozin’s up, and we must be scratchin’ gravol for new diggin’g, and—
“The ‘pnssnni lie grinned at tbe ole hedgehog.
At the ole hedgehog, at the ole hedgehog;
Tin- ‘possum he grinned at the ole hedgehog, “Way down by the Squantum river, etc.
Thus spoke and sting Old Shadow, as he made his appearance in the midst of a number of forms that lav stretched in slumber beneath th* arching boragns of the surrounding trees.
It was morning, and tho rising sun had just gilded the tops of the forest trees. The old trapper had been on guard, and as daylight had relieved him from duty, he made his appearance in camp before any' of his companions had awakened.
In a few minutes the avengers were on foot, moving about to exercise their cramped limbs and to drink in the fresh morning air.
“ Wal, I hope you feel as fresh as a new cut,” said the old scout ; “ but it makes the blood leap 'in my ole carcass when I think how nigh ye come gittdn’ yer poles shaved by them are red, whoopin’, th levin varlets.”
“ Well. I should judge we all felt considerably refreshed and rested,” said Amos Meredith, “ but I supnose you feel none the better for your night or vigilance.”
“ Ho, the dickens I” exclaimed the scout; “I feel as fresh as a young b’ar arter a night’s raid inapig-pen. Why, bless ye. it's nothin’ for Ole Shader to rampage around all day ondnight too. I’m a tough ole cuss. But thar's'ona thing sartin: I’m beginnln’ to feel as boiler IM a , dried pokaberry stalk. Haven’t had any nntri-1 ment fur the stummick fur two full days. And

" Wehavd to depend on our rifles for food,” mid one of the Avengers, “ and we can't work without it”
“That’s the right cackle,” replied theold hunter, “so I’ll go out and snatch m an old gobbler, it a lump o’ venison, and you 'uns can strike a Are to knock the stiffness outen it.
*■ Perhaps one ol u» bad better accompany youf’ said young Harriott.
“ Oh, the deuce, no,” replied the hunter, sling-tog his rifle over his shoulder and strolling off into the woods, humming to himself " the old hedgehog."
Old Shadow was a true type of the woods, a born Indian-fighter and hunter. He had one fault, however; he was never still, but where others seemed to succeed by silence and precaution, he seemed to excel by his recklessness and careless habits, or, in other words, mere accident
After leaving the Avengers, he pushed on quite rapidly a mile or more from camp before ne began looking for signs of game. At length he came to a little creek whose shores lie carefully examined. He saw turkey tracks in abundance where they had gone down to the water’s edge to drink.
Seating nimself under cover of some bushes where he could command a fair view of the surrounding, he took from his pocket a small, hoi* low bone which he placed to his lips and produced a succession of sounds in exact imitation of the hen-turkey’s call. Then lie listened, but heard nothing. He repeated the call, and. almost instantly, there came to his ears the far-off gobble, gobble of a turkey.
But the old hunter shook his head doubtful! v. *nd after a moment had elapsed he uttered the call again.
Again he was answered.
“ Durn my ole riggin," he exclaimed to himself; “ that s not gmuwine. or my hearin’ and experience don't amount to shucks. No, siree. bob-tail, that's >•ot a turkey's gobble. It's a blarsted red-skin’s gobble, and it's hard tollin' what the lopin’ varlet is arter. He may be try ill’ to git me into trubble, and he may take my call for the gmuwine article. I’ll try it agTn.”
He re[ieated his call. It was answered immediately, and the sound seemed to bo nearer than before.
“ No, it’s not a turkey’s answer,” he mused; so ftit as the imitation’s consarned, it ’11 do, but if my head’s level thar’s too long an interval between each gobble. If it’s a red he’s eoming up the crick, and I profiose to set him up, if lie comes nosin’ ’round me; fur I’m hungry as a buzzart, aud when I'm hungry Old Bhailer knows his temper isn't as sweet and mild as an angel’s—oh, no—‘ and the possum he grimied '— but, see here, old fool, keep still if ve want Ingin h’ar.”
The old hunter having thus enjoinod silence upon himself, stole from his covert, crept down to the water’s brink where he carefully ensconced himself upon some drooping foliage. Here he awaited the transpiration of events.
The sound of footsteps in the water soon caught his practiced ears. He glanced down the stream and saw- a savage wading up the creek. He was stepping with all the caution he could muster, with eves and ears on the alert.
Old Shadow chuckled and rubbed his hands with glee in anticipation of a fight with an Indian, which he relished more keenly than a leg of roasted turkey.
The canning savage came 011, but the old hunter could form no idea what he meant by his stealthy movements. He was surely not trying to steal upon a turkey.
“ No. siree!” Old Shadow suddenly exclaimed to himself; " tho varlet means deviltry. I can BOe it in his snaky eye—he’s arter scalps—ah!”
Just at this juncture the red-skin stopped within three stepsof him, and craning his neck, uttered the shrill gobble of the male turkey.
“ Now fur the tug,” thought Old. Shadow, and he at once gave utterance to tho "cluck, cluck, cluck ” of the hen turkey.
Then he saw the savage turn, aud parting the foliage, peered into his very face.
‘■florain’. Mister Rod-sKin,” was the cool, laconic salutation of tho old hunter.
The Indian uttered an indignant “ Ugh!” and grasped his tomahawk, but, before he could draw it, Old Shadow^ long, muscular arm shot out from his shoulder ana his bony fist was planted between the red-skin’s eyes. Like a leaden weight, the savage fell full length in the water.
Before he could regain his feet, the old hunter fallowed up the advantage already gained by seizing his adversary by the scalp-lock “ dnrinng ” his head under water.
Although he was partly stunned by the blow that felled him, the savage made a desperate effort to regain his foot In point of strength lie ¥H more than a match for the old hunter, but tha latter’s wiry suppleness more timn neutralised this advantage.
.> W»a struggle waxed warm for several ado
utes, both combatants kicking, striking and floundering about until they were completely enveloped In ashower of flying water and spray. They fought in silence, neither showing a fear of the other by uttering a sound that could be heard fifty yards away.
The strength of the savage, however, soon began to grow feebler. This Old Shadow noticed more readily than the savage did himself. The old hunter had managed to keep the upper side, and the red-skin's head under water most of the time. Strangulation was telling fast upon the warrior. No weapons were used. Although the old hunter had plenty of chances to do so. he wished to test his physical powers in conflict with a savage, who, he saw, possessed not only the advantage of size, but age—he being in the very prime of manhood.
And the savage seeing the inferiority of his foe's long, lank form and wrinkled face, would show no humiliation to him. though he were in his death-throes, by begging for mercy or calling for help, even were it near. Such is the pnde of an Indian’s spirit.
This struggle lasted but a few moments longer. V ictory crowned the old hunter. The savage ceased to struggle, his muscles relaxed, and ne sunk down, limp and lifeless, at the scout’s feet in the water.
"Thar now, whew!” ejaculated the hunter, with an air of relief: " durn yer lop-sided mug, I guess ye won’t go gobblin'round these diggin s soon ag’in, disturbin’ of one’s prospect Tor a square meal. By Hunky! if I'd had a fair breakfast o' juicy venison to leant ag’inst. I'd bu’sted yer snoot the fust dip I give ye, ye red, rovin' varlet. Guess 1 won’t dirty” my knife with yer filthy skulp—leave it for the buzzards to do, and—
■	The possum he griuned at the ole hedgehog.
At the ole—'
But, see here, Ole Shader, thar’s danger o' maltin' a fool o' verself, and if yer want a turkey, let that eternal, everlastin' ole hedgehog
Thus chastising himself. Old Shadow waded from the stream, and procuring his rifle, proceeded a short distance down the creek. Here he agaiu concealed himself near the water's edge, and producing his bone, began call.ng for turkeys.
A “ginuine gobble" was soon the result of his calls; and presently a large, tine gobbler, with arched neck, inflated wattles and trailing wings, i-ame strutting prouiUy, yet cautiously, into view from the woods uu the opposite side of the creek.
It stopped within easy gunshot of Old Shadow, and the next instant his rifle had cracked, and the deceive. 1 bird was flopping about in his death-throes.
Old Shadow sprung from his ambush and was in the act of stepping into the stream to wade across after the turkey, when he involuntarily started back, with suddeu surprise. But it lusted only for a moment. The cause of it was the presence of the body of his late savage foe. floating on the surface of the water before him. But without giving the lifeless lorm a second glance, and being eager to secure his game, ne bleppcd into the water and U?gan wading
But at this instant there wa.< a quick plash in the water, then the old scout felt his legs seized bv the arms of the supjmsed dead Indian, and his feet jerked suddenly from under him. Then began another terrible struggle in the creek, but this time the savage had the advantage.
CHAPTER XXI. vamosing the ranche.
It was night—night w-lthin the robbers’ hidden ranche. Lights were burning on the rough deal table around which fifteen men were sitting. wearing their numliered masks. No bottles nor cards ornamented their table. Matters of graver importance were before them.
" Well, what news have you for us to-night, Ten?" asked Pirate Paul of bis spy.
“ Nothing more than that we're in a fair way to get our necks haltered,” was the spy’s cool response.
** How# how-?*' asked a dozen voices.
•	■ Well, sirs, there's a spy watching our movements—in fact, knows exactly where our ranche is—was in it but a few nights ago. ”
The robbers started violently, and a cry of surprise burst from their lips.
*• Do you know who that spy is?” asked one.
“ Yes. It is a woman.”
•' A woman!” burst from the lips of the astonished outlaws.
“ Yes; one of the new-comers, Miss Martha Gregory. I heard her tell Sylveon Gray that Scott Snirely was her husbana.”
Another exclamation of surprise, mingled with suppressed laughter, burst from the lips of the masked villains.
“How’s that, captain?” asked one; “didnlt know you were a married man.”
"Nor I either,” replied the outlaw chief. “I thought I had tumbled that mulatto wench into the deepest hole in the St Lawrence river where she would never get out again. But, she must have b/rn ixxaaseed of the devil, and didn’t
drown worth a cent, and has now come to dll my footsteps with her baby face and blue ey<9 It appears that the traitor El Pardou, waafl friend of the Gregoriee, and he has put her o9 our track. But now, in order to save eur nedffil and ranche, we have got to do two or tmSB things. The settlers think we are on s ftnJj trading expedition—so we are. Now we want’I to trig up, a la Indian, as they would say JaH fashionable circles, capture Sylveen Gray that Martha Gregory, as she calls herself. Wn will then carry them to the Indian ylUaal There I will compel Sylveen to wed me an? Miss Martha I will give to Red Elk. for I haT# promised to take the red idiot a white wifljl Martha will suit him 1 know, if he kt-ep6 KM eyes out of reach of her finger nails. DeviliB curious I never recognized her before "
" When had we better make the Indian moW you propose, captain?” asked the spy.	, j
"This blessed night. It won’t do to delay the matter; for if that woman is my old flanij she may let the cat out and have the w hole vu* lage upon us. So let us begin our toilet afci once."
There was a general stir among the robbent. and for the next hour they were busily engamol in donning their Indian costume, which they always kept ready for such emergencies Thoe*' that bad long hair had it cut close to the skull, with the exception of the indispensable scalp.; lock, and then painted a dirty red. Their hand*: and faces were also given a good coat of painty which was declarative of their being on tha war-path.
When the toilet was completed and they had gathered around their table to drink a parting bumper, one could not have told—not knowing;1 —hut that they were Indians. From long association with the red-men, they had iiarned their language, habits and movements to per. fection, and it is not likely their disguise would be penetrated.
At length, when all were dressed and u r med for the departure, Pirate Paul said:
" Now, boys, let us lean out for tall timU r." The lights’ were extinguished, and the next instant tbe grim, shadowy forms of the pirates were filing away through the black, echoles* chambers of their hidden ranche.
C'HAITER XXII.
8 Y L VE E N'S MISTAKE.
Two days following Sylveen Gray’s last in* terview with Balph St. Leger. she and Martha Gregory were strolling leisurely along the river, near tbe lovers' old trysting-place, engaged in.' oonversatioA.
S\ lveen seemed sad at heart, and'her cmo» tions did not escape the notice of Miss Gregory*-, "You seem sad at heart of late. S>lveen,* she said; " why is it, dear? Has your loverdaft; serted you?’
" No, Martha; I have deserted him.’’
"You don’t say! Why, Sylveen?” and Miw Gregory turned pale. "Have you fallen in love with Scott Shirely?1'
"No; but you remember what you told me about this ring, do you not?"
"Yes; I told you it was a charm againut prairie pirates.”
" Exactly : and so I became anxious to try it upon Ralph St. Ix-ger. whom Shirely had told me was Pirate Paul. I met him M our old meeting-place, under this very tree. He saw the ring. He started end stared at it as though it had been a ghost, then made some excited inquiries in regard to it. What Shirely had said about him. and what you bad said about the ring, led n:e to accuse nim of being Pirate Paul; then, turning, I fled from his presence. But, oh, Martha! my poor heart is breaking. 1 can not give Balph up, though lie be Denth-Noteh himself!"
“ No, you shall not give him up. Sylveen.” ex* claimed 'Martha. " There is some terrible mi» take in this ring matter. Although 1 know not wbat occupation Ralph St Leger follows, I know, beyond a doubt, he is not Pirate Paul nof one of his gang."
“ But he acted as you said a robber would, when he saw the ring.’’
"That may all be, Sylveen: but, it’s a mis* take I had not calculated upon. Ralph may have known something of that ring king before it came into possession of him who gave it to me. But, rest assured, Ralph is not a robber.*
“ Oh, Heaven I then I have committed an un-1 pardonable error 1 fear. I may never see Ralph again.”
" I will do all I can to bring about, a meeting and reconciliation,” said Martha; “but, Syl-vocn, has Scott Shirely pressed his suit for you* hand lately?”
“ He has asked me to be his wife repeatedly. But I do not love him. I love Ralph alone. Still uncle Hatch is anxious that I should marry him—insists upon it, and says I will have to choose between him and poverty. I do not know wbat to do, Martha.”
“ Tell Scott Shirely to look at that ring tha next time you see him. Ask him if he remembers the maiden he gave it to, in Quebec, scare** ly a year and a half ago. Ask him whether tha waters of the St Lawrence ever give up th*j£ dead, and whether or not he has a wife already P.

Satan. But I teli ye, lads, wind is ebaree ’boat this old karknss, and, hanger is purty Dlenly. But I’ve got a fine twiey out tbar, and feel much like I could take half o’ it, feathers and aU."
Omaha waded across the creek and procured the turkey, and then they, all returned to where the Avengers had lighted a Are.
It required but a few minutes to dress the game in hunters' style, then it was roasted* to a crisp brown, and a goodly portion of it eaten with a sharp appetito and keen relish.
After the meal was completed and the remnants of tho turkey stowed away for future use, Old Shadow expressed his readiness to fight his way through to tho Indian village.
The little band soon resumed its journey, and as the day advanced, the keen eye of Omaha detected a’ fresh trail in the yielding soil. There were the hoof-prints of two or three horses, and n number or moccaain-*racks. Both Omaha and Old Shadow agreed upon their being made by a partv of white men; and they all had reason to believe it, was a party of robbers, pushing for the Indian village.
The A vengers at once proposed to follow the trail, believing it would be a more practicable route to the Indian village than any other, for if it was the trail of enemies they would naturally seiect the best and nearest route known to them to reach the Indian stronghold.
Omaha took the trail, and like a boagle freed from the leash, ho led his companions forward at a rapid pace.
The day woro gradually away. It wanted an hour of sunset when a low whistle broke suddenly from Old Shadow’s li|*. The party camo to an instant halt.
“ What now. Shadow f asked one of tho boys.
“ Ah. that’s it," ho replied: “ you fellers are young and liml>er; yer bearin’ niay be better than mine.

CHAPTER XXIV.
AN INTRUDER IN CAMP.
More than an hour before sunset a party of about twenty persons went into camp in ’ the i solitude of the dense woods bordering" the Sioux ! river. Most of the party—in fact, all hu two ] —were dressed and painted as Indians, .heir movements, their garbs and equipment were purely Indian, but the anatomical construction of the facial outlines told that they were white 1 men in disguise.
I The other two persons were females. They were captives, too, for their hands were bound before tnem and their heads wero bowed in grief. They were young women, but exceed*
: ingly handsome, yet depressed in spirit and fa-| tigued with journeying.
In the background two horses were cropping j the foliago. Their backs showed saddle-marl£ and had, in all probability, been ridden by tS captive females.
The white Indians are loungiripibotit in attitudes of listlessness and security. They seem I to fear no danger. The savage %<ey fcnow is j their friend, and there are no ^ite parties I around of sufficient strength to endanger their : situation. So they can rest with impunity there : lieneath the panoply of the green forest trees,
| while their lair captives may chafe in spirit I over their confinement, for it will avail them ' nothing.
I A camp-fire is burning at one side, and one of | the pale Indians is busy around it, broiling venison for their supper. It requires but a few I miautes to prepare the meal, and when it is an-1 nounced as ready, the hands of the captives are j freed from their bonds. Wien tender slices of I the venison are brought to them, not on a silver tray, but on large green leaves. One of the ! captives accepts the proffered viand—the other refuses it
“You had better take it. dear Sylveen,” whispered Martha Gregory to her young friend: “ it will give you strength which you may yet need, dearest. ”
Pretty, sad-hearted Sylveen Gray took the venison and ate it, and after all it proved quite ! delectable to her taste. It added strength to her
Ibody, and in so doing it strengthened her hope ot oeing reacned from Pirate Paul and hit minima, who had effected their capture that
\ Sylveen was startled by these, remarks. They [$pzzled her.
! “You appear to know Scott Shirely, Martha,” sho said.
“Know him) Alas; to my sorrow! I, Svl-veer, am his lawfully wodded wife, whom he 4ecerv*}i betrayed and tried to murder.’'
•	“ Martha, is this really the fact?"
“ It is, Syi^^en. He gave me that ring, so you see why • gave it to you, for when he thought he had drowned mo, he knew I had the ring on my finger; and by his seeing it had come to light again, I thought it might frighten the
▼Ulam.”
“ Then he is a pirate r “ Yes; he is Pirate Jfaul!’’
A. little cry burst from Svlveen’s lips.
“Yes, ha is Pirate Paul,1’ continued Martha. ** And.I am here to dog his footste|is and bring him to justice. But the hour has not yet come <or me to strike ”
“ But, how did you find out that ho is Hrate P-uili”
“ Through a dear friend—El .’ardou.”
“ The victim of Death-Notch f “ No. the victim of the robbers themselves, rhey-mistrusted him of being a spy, and having murdered him to avert suspicion, marked him and the troo under which he was found, with Vie totem of Death-Notch."
" Then vou know where the robbers’ hidden toninr
“Ido. I have been in it, and ere many days boss, it shall be made public. Shirely does not Idow that I live. Ho would kill me if he did. My love for him has turned to hatred, and I am Here for revenge. But, Sylveen, here is a slip paper and a pencil. Write a note and leave it. here for Ralph. Ask his forgiveness, and for •mother Interview.”
“ He might never come for it, Martha."
“ He was here yesterday and tho day before, lie may come yet t&dav. Ho cannot give up ►is love for you, dear Sylveen.”
“ How-do you know he was here, Martha?”
“ I have a spy on Shirely’s track. He saw ralph here. He saw him go each time and look iito that hollow tree, as if half-expecting to find i> imethlng there."
“It is our old post-ofllce.” cried Sylveen, a light of hope lieaming in her eyes. ’’ I will write him a note and leave it here. Oh, Ralph! Ralph! I hope you will forgivo me!”
She took tne paper and j>encil and wrote a note, which, with a prayer of hope, she de-poiated in the hollow tree.
7'hen the two wended their wav back to tho village.
In lees than half an hour later, that note was re<vl, but noi by Ralph St. I -egor.
morning while taking their usual walk In tha woods near Stony Cliff.
The disguised men ate their supper in silence, then resumed their lounging attitudes; *omo engaged in smoking, others in silent thought
Suddenly the whole band starts. Something like the sound of muao reaches their ears, drifting through the forest aisles in notes faint a» those of an Eolian harp—so faint as to he almost inaudible.
“ What the deuce is it, anyhow P asked Pirate Paul.
" Music, captain, sure as you’re a sinner,” replied one of his men, listening eagerly.
"Whew!” ejaculated another, “this must be paradise itself. The angels are tuning their
harps. “
The next instant every man is upon his feet Those enchanting strains make all strangely anxious to know from whence such melody
comes.
" We can’t all leave at a time, boyB,” said Pirate Paul, glancing in a significant manner at the captives; " part go at a time and well last longer. ’
Seven or eight of the pirates resumed their jiositdons of ease on the ground, while the others stole away in the direction from whence the music seemed to come.
As they move on and on, the sound gradually grows plainer, clearer and sweeter. They move with the silence of phantoms, almost entranced by the ravishing sounds that come to their ears. Surely it is an enchanted spot. They falter. Their wicked hearts grow cowardly. Something so sweet and heavenly in that music makes them feel as though they were approaching a hallowed spot with unclean spirits. Finally they pause. But the music swells out, nearer and sweeter than before. They can not resist its seductive inspiration. It fascinate* them. It draws them on and on, until they stand upon the banks of a little stream, enchanted by what they see.
A little opening or glade is before them. In the center of it stands a little vine-embowered cabin. A narrow path leads from the door through an archway of flowers ami creeping lines. They run their eyes along the path, ana just before’ them, where it touches the creek, they see two persons seated—a girl and a young man. Tho former appears to them like an angel in a dream. In her Lap she holds a Spanish guitar, over whose string* her little white finger, are fluttering liko snou flakes, calling forth thes*
’ sweet, melodious sounds.
They were enraptured; and that they mighl have a fairer view of the place and its inhabitants—that they might bring these sweet strains of music nearer, they parted the foliage and peered through upon the twain of lovers, Vida St. Leger and Fred Travis.
Leaving them to gaze enchanted upon the wildwood beauty and her lover, let us return to the robbers' camp, where. Sylveen Gray and Martha Gregory are prisoners.
As soon as the captives had finished their ipeager supper, their hands were rebound. They were then placed in a small bower constructed for them of boughs and blankets.
Here the two women sat and talked over their misfortune and probable fate. Sylveen was sad at heart and low-spirited, while Martha was hopeful of being rescued, and defiant to her captors.
" Suddenly, however, their conversation was disturbed by a stranger voice that seemed to be approaching the camp, and singing, in a loud, jolly tone, the words:
•• The ’possum he grinned at the ole hedgehog,
The ole hedgehog, the ole hedgehog.
The ’jKissnm he grinned at the ole hedgehog,
'Way down by the Squantum—"
•• Halt, there!” suddenly rung out the voice of one of the robbers, and the peremptory demand whs accompanied with the click of a gun-lock.
Old Shadow, for he the intruder was, ceased singing, and confronted the white Indian with apparent surprise.
“ By the royal voice of the woods,” he exclaimed, “if you ain't a sassy cuss, now! Who are vc, ennyhow?"
" Me Ingin,” replied the outlaw, attempting to counterfeit bad English.
“ Now, olo buck, I’d hate to tell ve that yer tollin' a snug little lie, but, nevertheless, it’s a fact; you are a ginuwine, downright, flat-footed, bare-faced—”
“ Be careful, idiot I” exclaimed the indignant prairie pirate; “ you.might utter yKT death-warrant”
“ And you be faeerfnl, ole mug-bcoi or I’ll go through ye like an ounce chunk o’lead. nn Ole Shader, Td have ye know, ye villainous bull-pup, and if I onc’t nit across a man’s vision, he’s got his pass for the sulpher diggin’s.” |
“You’re an old, blab-mouthed fool,” retorted the robber, growing bolder as his friend gathered around him.
“ You measure others’ grain in yer own bushel, I see,” replied the old hunter; "but* Mister, what's In that bower?”
“ Kane of your business,” returned tho Indignant robber.
“Cool, very oool; y* must hsrre an icebsrg
CHAPTER XXm.
THE BTRUOGUS IN THE CREKKL
Ftttc two foes grappled in a deadly embrace
-	twisting themselves together liko twining ser-in pliant and subtle folds. So swift were « ei r movements and evolutions tliat their bodies si emed incorporated into one. For awhile no Viie could have told how the battle went, for Biey fought at times beneath the water, and at oAhiir times they were enshrouded in a cloud of Vain and spray.
F >r several minutes tlio conflict waxed hot. It
*	as evident, too, that the strength of both was f#Umg. for this conflict was less desperate than it frst had been. Still, neither of them hail [drawn a weapon, and the struggle would have
V	be decided by main strength.
Suddenly, however, several figures emerged fcrom the shadows of the woods, and gazed down on the struggling foes. They were savages, and a gleam of surprise and vengeance flashed from their eyee when they discovered tho cause of the confusion in the water—saw their comrade ir- combat with the old hunter—saw that the tide of victory was slowly but surely turning >■* favor of the white man.
Quickly one of their number sprung into the _*reek and began wa4ing to his friend’s assistance, but, at the same instant, the rush of feot wns heard on the opposite bank—a figure shot through the air, ana landing 011 thesavage, boro h/m down in the water. It was tho friendly Omaha, while upon the bank, facing the savages on the opposite side, stood the Avengers, with their rifles leveled full at the breasts of the red tie.
A bloody conflict was only averted by a yell of triumph bursting from Omaha's lips, closely followed by another yell from the lips of Old Shadow.
The savages recoiled, and not wishing to enrage in a struggle, the Avengers did not follow them un. nor lire a single shot.
Omaha and Old Shadow at once made their appearance from the creek. A scalp was at Omalia’s girdle and a glow of triumph in his dark •yes. Old Shadow bore no trophy of his oon-mct, but he was gasping with exhaustion.
“ Rather a tight place yon were in. Shadow,” •aid one of our young friends.
1 41 Whoop, by crash!” he exclaimed, “ ye bet it war now, bat thsctumin’ varlet has passed tn hlf /teokymenta. That war twic>t ha disturbed lay prorpw't fur grab, tho low-lifed hound o’

•" “ Well, whnt’s that to'To-.i?"
“Why, yo dnrnod sap-he-d- : -tin, yo stok-
^ Yoo tell a-”
The pirate did not finish the sentence, for the flst at Old Shadow was planted directly between bis eyes, causing his heels to describe a semi-drcle through the air.
The outlaw was a large, burly fellow, and no doubt possessed of twice the old hunter’s ktrength; but, with all the grit of an old hound, the latter gii»ppled with his adversary before he could regain his feet.
•	The other robbers gathered around the combatants to witness the certain annihilation of the impertinent old hunter; but they soon had a, conflict of their own to prosecute. For the WSf Wow from Old Shadow was the signal for Ihe Avengers to make their appearance.
-One discharge, however, of the Avengers' trearms caused the robbers to flee with terror. Rrey attempted to rally when they saw the number of the foe. but were so closely pressed that they were compelled to continue their flight, leaving two or three of their number behind dead.
The Victorious Avengers did not pursue them (a •. No time was to be lost, for thev had seen th 5 robbers under Pirate Paul leave the cainp a few minutes before, and knew not how <mon they would return. 80 they turned to assist Old Sliadow; but neither he "nor his foe was to be seen!
They saw at once, however, where the lenves itnd gmund were tore up in a broad path extending down a steep inclination that finally terminated in a perpendicular embankment. The combatants must have rolled over this cliff, and had, in all probability, been dashed to \toms,
The Avengers hurried to the edge of the precipice aud gazed down for their old friend.
A ludicrous and doleful sight met their view The cliff was about twenty feet high, and at the bottom was a pool of stagnant wau-r. whose bottom was a soft, oozy slush of black mud.
In the center of this pool lay the robber on his back, and astride of him sat Old Shadow, completely covered with mud, his cap off. and his hair straggling in nraddy, draggled trusses down over his face and eyes ’
The robber was struggling desperately, though . every movement he made served to settle his body deeper and deeper in the water and mire.
Slowly and regularly as “clock-work” Old Shadow1* bony fist arose and fell with a sodden sound in the face of the robber, while he gave vent to an ejaculation of vengeance between eaca blow.
“ I’ll smash (whack) your durned (whacki mug for (whack) you,” he exclaimed, “ ve lopin’ fwliack) gal-thief ye (whack), and Til lam (whack) ye how to (whack) insult a (whack) gentleman orter (whack) this, too!"
“See here—stranger,” the robber managed to Slubber oat, “ I—I beg your—-pardon.”
Old Shadow paused to gain Dreath.
‘•80, ho!” he exclaimed, “vebeg. do ve. ve »i^en big thief r •‘Til admit you’re the best man, stranger, so please let me up, or I’ll suffocate.”
“ That's the right cackle, old snoozy; say on tt Jt way. Ye can’t say enny tilling that'll tech
•	bonder spot quicker.”
“ If you're as hard all over as your cussed fist, you've 110 tender spot ’bout you.
Whack, came the old hunter’s fist in the robber’s face, causing him to bellow and beg for •norcv.
•• Then speak in a more perlite manner 'bout viv Cst. ve vogabone vs.”
Tut; rr-'bber. soeing tnat no one came to His as-*
•	istanco, and that the hunter had the advantage of him, was compelled to submit to his term-., and os he begged manfully and politely, as Old BhoJow termed it, was permitted to raipe his head ont of tho mud and water. Still the old liunter maintained his seat upon his- body, and •eming slightly forward, he laid the tips of his 'nrtox finders "together, and with one eye half ■lose 1, he said in a reproving tone:
''Nowthen,’you big gawk ve. I perpose to vye go, hide and ha r, but, let me give ve a le -cle advice. Go and repent, wash ver face. M'l keepyer nose clean; and if ever the devil or bis angels tempt ye to steal anuther gal, or : il. .1 gentleman a liar, think o' this mud-puddle Vttl. vorars truly, and then say, ‘ Git ye behind me, 'Satan,’ then go bum to your dad. Now, remember this advice.”
Tim old hunter arose as he concluded his ad-
•	rice and permitted the robber to regain his feet, ; -and slink away among the shrubbery.
When be was out or sight Old Shadow-waded from the pool, ascended the cliff and rejoined ! his friends, the most doldfulsight imaginable. He saw at once the youths were fairly con vulsed with suppressed Laughter, and coolly Ssid;
"tart, lads, if ye feol like it, Nevsr Le* enny-thing spoil a good, hearty lari It’s one o' the HMttDOas o' life, and. worth more to onsh digestion than all the yarbs known to Ingin medical sdeoce. Yea. lar* her out, lads. I know I’m
not very prepossessin’ at present, bat then, the mud '11 soon wear off.”
The young men could hqld bacl: no lon-er, and burst into a roar of laughter. But their joy was soon turned into disappointment, when Omaha, who ha-1, gone to see after the captive maidens, returned with the news that they.wcre not in the bower, nor conld they be found anywhere about They had either fled with affright, or had been spirited away during the conflict. But, whichever it was, our friends had no time for speculation over it, for at this instant they saw Pirate Paul and his men returning through the woods, and not wishing to run the risk of an engagement with such a superior number of foes, they beat a hasty retreat into the woods.
CHAPTER XXV
A NIGHT OF TER 110IIS.
TERROR-stricken. Sylveen Gray and Martha Gregory had fled from the bower the instant the Avengers hod made their charge upon the robbers, going in a southward direction. Although their liands were lioimd. they soon gained the cover of tho woods and then stopiied. By placing their hands close together, they were enabled to untie their bonds.
They now hastened on, and not until the shadows of twilight had begun to gather around them did they halt to rest or consider the course they were following—whether it led toward new "danger, or toward safety. They at once found that they were entirely ignorant of their course, and" felt certain that new dangers would beset their path during the night, or before they could reach a place of security.
•• Martha." said Sylveen, “ 1 fear we have not bettered our situatiou. Those that attacked the robbers were friends, undoubtedly. I think I recognized them as a partv of voung men who spenta few days at Stony C’liff.’’
If we had taken a second thought we mipht. have been saved of all this night s wandering about through the woods.” replied Marthn. “ but I wrs so taken with the thought of escape that I never considered the consequence of our haste. However, it may be best after all, for those that attacked the robbers may have been defeated.’’
•• That’s nil very true. Martha, so let us hurry on and get as far as possible from bere before darkness sets in. No telling what terrors this night may bring forth. l)eath-Notch may be in these woods to-night.”
Thev hurried rapidly on. They might have token bearings by the last faint gleam of the setting sun. but thev were too greatly terrified to think of that. Ttiev thought only of putting distance betweon the pirates and themselves.
Tho twilight soon deepened into darkness, rendering tne gloom within the forest almost impenetrable, But. the moon soon came up. and although the trees above them shut out its rays from their path, the darkness became mitigated, and they were enabled to move on with less difficulty and fear.
But. already tlieir minds were in n hi»rh state of excitement, and at every sound they would start with fear, expecting to see. the iiext instant, the terrible Death-Notch appear before them. This fear was agony itself, but there was no help for them now. ' They must breast it through.
They moved on. and at length emerged into a little opening where the moon’srars fell full and unobstructed upon the earth. Their path lay across this opening. Thev never pause, but press out into the glade whfch they see is clear. When half-way across it. Uoof-strokes break upon their ears. They pause and look about them with a mingled feeling of hope and fear.
Forth from the shadows of the woods thev see 'a horse appear. It is riderless. But it is bridled, and moves not like a horse escaped from its master. It seems to obey the volition of some invisible power.
It is moving at right angles with tbe fugitives’ course. It pricks up its ears and shies slightly at sight of them. But it soon falls back into its former course, as if reined there by that invisible rider.
An old horderman would have suspicioned something wrong about that horse, but not so with the maidens.
“ It is one of the robbers’ horses, is it not. Sylveen f” asked Martha.
“ It looks like one of them—the one you rode, Martha.” replied Svlvoen.
" I believe I will try and catch it. It has broke away from She robbers, and by obtaining possession of it, we can ride by toms and lessen the labor of our journey thereby.”
So saying, she advanced with outstretched hand, calling kindly to the animal. It turned head slightly toward her and moved on Martha stepped briskly to intercept it, and when she came within reach of him, she put out her hands and seized the reins: but at this instant herright of possession was disputed—a rider appeared on the back of the animal as if by magic. It was an Indian warrior I
Martha uttered a cry and started back. But - she was too late—entrapped. The savage seised her He had lifted her from the ground, and
placing her rudely across the withers of his
liorse, gallopci awav into the shadows of ths woods.
Sylveen real^od her lonely situation, and with a shriek of terror she fled across the opening and plunged into the illimitable darkness.
Poor girl I her situation was terrible now. An agonizing sense of her loneliness was nowadded to her fears' and terrors, and a feeling of despondency came over her. But with light footsteps and heavy heart she hurried on.
Suddenly there was a broad, bright flash before her. ' She stopped. Her further prqgreag was arrested. At her feet rolled the silent water? of the Sioux river.
Half despairing, the maiden sunk down and covering her face with her hands, gave way to a paroxysm of grief. What should she do? What could she do toward getting out of that interminable wilderness?
Then she endeavored to think. She recalled the fnct of Stony Cliff being situated upon the river. A ray or hope was Idndled within her breast when she thought that by following the course of the stream, she would raaeh the village. She arose to her feet. She gaze* up and down the river to see which way it was flowing. Then a clond of bitter disappointment came over her. She knew not whether she was below the village or above it!
Then, something lying at the edge of the water attracted her attention. It was an empty canoe. She walked down tho bank and entered it. She was tired out with walking and concluded to "risk herself in the canoe and journey down the river.
Taking up the paddle she headed tho craft in the proper course and began her journey, keeping close within the shadows of the east snore.
She plied the paddle vigorously and with no little skill. The little craft went skimming over the water with great rapidity, yet for its size it seemed to draw considerable water, and dip slightly at one end.
The heart of the fair girl began to take courage. She felt almost certain she was traveling in the right direction to reach the village, ana with this hopeful assurance of a speedy escape, she pressed on.
But. suddenly, there came to her ears, the dip of paddles. She ceased paddling and listened. True enough, a canoe was ascending tbe river. She leaned forward and endeavored to see through the gloom, but, all along the shore it was black as cbaos. But out in the center of the river where the moon’s ravB fell unobstructed, there was » narrow belt of light, and within this she saw a canoe, with two occupants, coining up tbe river. They were Indians. This she could easily see by tbe plumes in their heads. They were sitting in the attitude of intense listening, and from this Sylveen judged they had heard the dip of her paddle.
Witb great presence of mind, the maiden ran her canoe close in shore where the darkness was intense, yet near where a single patch of moonlight, two or three feet in diameter, fell upon the water so bright- that all the moon’s rays seemed brought to a focus there.
Sylveen could still see the savages. They were moving slowly up the stream, stUl listening as if in doubt. She felt in hopee they would l«ss on. But they did not. Their savage curiosity was arrested and it would have to be satisfied ere they continued their journey.
Suddenly the hoarse croak of a frog was beard, almost under the very prow of her canoe. There was something so shrill and rasping in its notes that it caused her to start violently.
Then she heard a quick flounder, a splash in t l.e water, a low gasp, a dull, sodden blow. She felt her canoe rocked by tbe waves and gazed intently into the gloom to see what produced those "waves. A dull, phosphorescent gleam showed her two forms engaged in a silent death-struggle at the very prow of her canoe. What were they? Were they human? Surely they were. She could hear dull blowB, a wheezing nnd gasps.
Beasts did not struggle thus—so silently, so
deadly.
Sylveen was paralyzed with terror. She sat motionless and listened to the silent death-struggle. At last her. terrible thoughts found invol-untarv expression in the words:
“ Oh, who is it? who is it?"
“ Veath-NotchT'
The answer came in gasps—like that of 0 strangling being who had tried to raise his voic* to a warning shriek. It paralyzed Svlveen with terror. She could not move a muscle. Sbn sat like one in a trance, a graven image.
The struggling, however, soon ceased and all became as ominously silent as though the spot had never been called'into creation.
Then the silence was broken by the dip of paddlfts. She turned her head and saw the canoe with the savages coming directly toward her. F.scapo from them, or the terrible young Scalp-Hunter, seemed impossible. There was no avenue of escape open to her. The Hver-bank was high and shelving.
Driven almost to desperation, she decided to throw herself beneath Hie wave*, rather than suffer unknown horrors or endlen captivity,
She gored down at the black water*

teemed almost exhausted and despairing. It was Ralph lit. Leger's voice she whs certain. She was silent with tho mingled feelings of hope and terror.
“Sylveen,” again repeated the voice, “ it is I—Ralph 8t. Leger.”
A cry burst from Sylveeo's lips.
. Jt-icw Ralph. and he was well and alive. The next moment ne thrown himoftlf into the canoe, and, regardless of his plight, folded his sweetheart to his breast, and imprinted kisses of love upon her tremulous lips.
Both were speechless with joy. Neither thought of their last meeting and how they had parted. Love was all-powerful now.
When the first raptures of that meeting were over, each one expressed in words his and her Joy of that meeting. Then many questions were asked and answered. The struggle under the cliff Ralph thus explained:
“ I was concealed in the water, waiting for the two savages coming up the river. 8uddenly I heard the dip of paddles coming down the river, and when you, sweet Sylveen. ran your canoe close in shore, where I wus concealed to tlude the savages, I knew it was you; and when the frog croaked so near by, X discovered it was % savage concealed under the prow of your tanoe. I grappled with him, and—”
“ Ah!” interrupted Sylveen, “ then it was you who spoke the name of Death-Notch.”
“’Sh, dear Sylveen! I hear a footstep on the shore!” exclaimed Ralph, in an undertone.
They relapsed into silence, but heard nothing more of the footstep. Ralph seized the paddle and drove the canoe rapidly down the stream.
At length he spoke of the many dangers to which they were exposed, and then added:
“ Sylveen, it is not far to my home. I win lake you there to-night, for you are many miles from Stony Cliff. My dear little sister Vida will be ever so glad to see von.”
“Toorsisterr exclaimed Sylveen; “ then you \re not alone?"
“ No, dear Svlveen, but since you accused me »f being Pirafe Paul. I have been worse than vlcme—I have been miserable.’'
“ Then you did not receive the letter I left in the old hallow tree?"
“ Letter? No, 8ylveen, I found none there, though I have looked in that tree a dozen times since we parted last"
“I put one there, Ralph, asking your forgiveness. Some one must have found it.”
“ Then you have become convinced that I am innocent of your chaise T'
“Yes, Ralph, and I hardly deserve your forgiveness. But I was misled. The young woman who gave me the ring you saw upon my finger that day said it would be a charm against prairie pirates. She said if any one evinced surprise at sight of it, and made inquiries about it. as you know you did, Ralph, I could set him down oa a prairie pirate. Aiid, as Scott Shirely had told me you were Pirate Paul, I thought Miss Gregory's ring confirmed the story."
“Scott Shirely accused me of being Pirate PauI? The merciless villian! I am satisfied, fr om letters I found directed to Pirate Paul rflld written in cipher, that he is Pirate Puul frtnself.”
“Yes, he is, Ralph; this I know, for it was )i s who carried Martha Gregory and I iiway. B at why, Ralph, did you start so at sight of ^iat ring?”
“It was my dear mother’s ring, and was »aken from her by her murderers, the Indians, (early two years ago. I knew it at a glance. Prom whom did your donor receive it, Syl-/een?”
“ Prom Soott Shirely, whom Martha Gregory evs is her husband. ” *
There was a momentary silence. It was too dark for Sylveen to see the expression of vengeance that swept over bis face.
They talked on about Pirate Paul, Death-Notch, and upon other topics. Still they were happy and joyous, despite the dangers that surrounded them.
In the mean time Ralph worked busily at the paddle, and at length he turned from the river into the mouth of a small creek that was rendered black as Hades by the arcading foliage of the trees along either shore.
After following the windings of this stream for some time, the canoe touched the shore, and Ralph said:
Weare at home, Sylveen.”
He assisted her ashore and conducted her across the little glade toward his cabin.
A sweet, musical voice hailed them as they approachod the door. It was Vida's voice.
Ralph responded to her greeting and then conduct.*! Sylveen into the cabin. The room was lighted up with an oil lamp that burned on the table, where supper was waiting Ralph's ?3tura.
The youth introduced his little sister to his Utr protege, and the maidens' spirits seemed to flow, as it were, into one channel of congeniality and love.
Fred Travis was out when the brother came homo, but he soon made his appearance with Vida’S rifle tn hand.
“Ay, I we you are much bettor, my young •W™, aaid Ralph; “ but why are you out in
the chill air with that wolf-bitten arm of yours so later'
“I was scouting around your little Eden,” said Fred. “ Vida and I saw a number of In Hmn. around this evening.”
Ralph started, and for a moment that terrible fire of vengeance seemed kindling within his breast. But a word from Vida broke the awful spell.
1 “Yes, brother,” the sister said, “about dark we saw as many us a dozen Indians on the | south side of the' branch. But they made no I hostile demonstration and soon retired. But supper is waiting you, brother.
Then let us partake, for I presume Sylveen 1 is as hungry as 1." said Ralph.
The little company sat down and partook of the viands prepared by Vida, and it was not a meager supply, for the wildwood furnished not only gtune, but various kinds of delicious wild fruit*.
After supper was over. Ralph said:
"I will go out and look around the place a few minutes to see that we are in no danger.”
He took his weapons, anil having excused himself, left the cabin.
Sylveen now naira ted to Vida and Fred the story of her capture by the prairie pirates, the attack of the Avengers, her escape, the recai>* ture of her friend, her own adventures upon the river—in fact, everything that had transpired from the time of her capture up to that moment
“ Was there a voting Indian with those that attacked the robtersr asked Fred, after he had heard her story.
" I think there was,” replied Sylveen. “Iam almost positive it is the same party of young men and boys that spent a few days at Stonv Cliff.”
“ Thev must be my friends!” exclaimed Fred; "and if they are. I hope they will happen this way; but if they do not, I will have to look them up to-morrow.’’
”0h!”
The exclamation burst simultaneously from the lips of Vida and Sylveen. for at this juncture a strange sound rushed athwart the darkness without—a sound that thrilled the trio with i sudden alarm.
“ What was itf passed from lip to lip; but no answer could be given.
Fred arose and going to the door, looked out. All was silent, nor could a living object lie seen. He grew uneasy, but he did not permit a look or word to betrav his thoughts or feelings.
They talked on, but were guarded and silent. The dark eyes of Vida looked trustingly and confidingly info those of her lover. Each glance spoke the language of love plainer than words , could have done.
' The moments .wore on. Ralph did not return. The door stood ajar and the least sound floated in to their ears.
An ominous silence had settled around the place, but suddenly that strange sound broke upon their ears again—a sound like the flapping oi great wings.
Fred arose, and taking a rifle, went out into the yard. He could see nothing, and moved out and around the cabin—continuing still outward until he had reached the woods.
Vida and Sylveen sat alone, with wildly -throbbing hearts. Neither spoke; a silence as j ominous us death settled around them.
All at once, as if actuated by a single im- ! pulse. both of the fair girk* turned their eyes j toward the curtained recess that Fred had occu- ' nied during his illness. Both were sure they I had detected tho low, suppressed breathing of something, either human or Ixast, behind that t curtain.
They sat transfixed with inmost horror. There I was an intuitive foreboding of some awful dan- 1 ger hanging over them. It struck them both as a gust of wind world have done.
Thev listened with their hands pressed upon ! their breasts to still their palpitating hearts. They were not mistaken—there was something breathing behind that curtain'.
Terror is an awful agony to suffer. It [ blanches the chocks, and causes the eyes to dilate. the lijns to i>art and the breath to come hard.
Thus appeared the maidens. The)’ sit with their eyes upon the curtain, unable to cry out, unable to move.
They see something touch the curtain—some-i thing darts through it. It is the glittering blade of a long knife. Then they see a downward flash—a rent is cut in the curtain, and—they see no more. There is a rush of feet. The light goes out. They are in darkness. The door is slammed violently shut. They are prisoners. And then a yell, that seems to issue in chorns from a thousand throats, makes the night hideous as it echoes and re-echoes in demoniac shrieks through the dark, wooded aisles.
Where now was Fred Travis? where waft.the ! young Scalp-Hunter? Alas! whore, indeed?
CHAPTER XXVII.
THE VILLAINS’ COMPACT.
How long Pirate Paul and his men would have stood and gazod upon Vida St. Leger, enraptur-'• ed by the sweet melody of her voice and the
tones of her harp, there is no telling ' r,' theVS not been suddenly startled by the repqttof fl*$H arms in tho direction of the camp. BartpedS they at once beat a hasty retreat, and reaclj3* camp to find it entirely deserted by all but thleffe of their comrades, who lay dead upon the ground.
Their surprise and indignation knew no!’ bounds. Pirate Paul cursed himself for eraig permitting so many of his men to leave thr camp. He cursed the fair being whose sweelff voice he had permitted to draw them away, and swore an oath of vengeance upon her.
That the camp had been attacked bv whites, there was not a doubt, for the three dead men were upscalped. But while they stood lament, ing, in oaths and execrations, over their misfott tune, in loss of men and captives, a human figure emerged from the undergrowth and approached them. That he was human was aUtEey could make of him. for he was incrusted in a layer ot black mud and dirt from head to foot.
" What the devil is this? Who, or what ar# you?” asked Pirate Paul.
“ I’m Griff Morton, I am,” said the dolefol figure.
•’ Fiends and furies! How came these men slain? How came you in such a plight? Who did it? Speak. Griff Morton.”
The roboer narrated the whole transaction— the attack of the Avengers, and his own adven* ture in the pool, though he turned the tables, and made himself the nero of that conflict.
Pirate Paul ground his teeth and swore with rng^—swore that he would wreak a bloody re, venge upon the agents of his loss.
In the midst of his fury, an exclamation sud. denly burst from the lips of one of his men. Ha had discovered a party of Indians approaching them, and no sooner did Pirate Paul see them, than a shout of ioy burst from his lip6, that wa» answered back bv the savages.
The latter were Sioux, the party under Red Elk, with whom Pirate Paul was on intimat* terms of friendship.
In a minute the two fiarties were together.
The three dead pirates at once attracted Red Elk’s attention.
“ Has Le Subtile Fox had trouble (" he asked,
“ Yes; a pack of white hounds, calling them* selves Avengers, attacked my camp while most of my men were absent, and slew three of the guard, and escaped with two captive white squaws, one-of which I intended for you for a
“ It is bad,” replied Red Elk: “ the Avenger* are cunning. Red Elk set a trap for.them, mil thev were like the wolves that scent danger, and stole away. Death-Notch, too, is in tht woods.”
’’Seen him latelyT’-asked Pirate Paul.
“ But last night he arose from the heart ot oat camp-tire, as he arose in the council-lodge on the night of the storm, when helled on the horse of Le Subtile Fox.”
“He is a terrible creature, chief; and these Avengers will soon be more terrible than he. They must be hunted down and burned with fire.
•' Le Subtile Fox speaks the truth.’-“Then let us to work, chief. Shall we go together f'
“ What does the white chief say is best?”
’’ Can you bend two bows as easv as oner*
’• Red Elk is strong, but he can Lend one bow easier than two.”
“ Then if we work together well be as two bows; we will be strong, and the enemy ran not defeat us; but if we go separate, we’ll le as on* bow—easy bent.”
’’ The white chief sneaks the truth P.«d Elk is willing to join hanas with him."
Then from this moment let our vci-gc.'.i.ce bo* gin. The settlements must fall if we would reach the strong ann of our enemies. ”
“ Le Subtile Fox should have been a red chief. His brain is quick. Hb-mind isl. iigacd reaches far ahead. The white man’s wigwam* must fall: his horses be ridden r.way and his cattle slain. then he can not live as tho red man does in the open woods, and by his riile and bow.”
“ Then we can begin our work near here. But a short distance away stands a little cabin that ‘ I never knew was in existence till to-day. It must be the home of some old trapper. Thera is a beautiful white »quaw there She would’’ make Le Subtile Jox or Red Elk a nice wife.”
“ The white chief speaks truly. She is beautiful as an angel.”
“ Then you have seen her?”
“ To-day my braves discovered their wigwam for the first time. A cunning pal e-face live* there.”
" Did vou intend to destroy the cabin and capture the beautiful white girl I”
“ When night makes everything t&MNNf dows, then will we strike, while squaw sung to her pale-face lover by tlMMjHfb four of my braves to red their cabin agM^H cealed themseives. Le Subtile Fox can pale squaw forhis slave. Red Elk wanfl^^H scalps.

•	If by waiting for darkness we can save the life of the wurrior, it will be well to do so,” replied the diplomatic Red Elk.
“ Yes, ves, Red Elk, that’s all true; but here, boys, let us perform the last sad rites for these poor devils, by nutting them under the ground.”
It required but a few moments to inter the slain pirates in shallow graves, hollowed by means of knives mid their hands; but by the tame it was accomplished darkness had gathered over the forest.
Xl.eu these human domonx took up their line of march toward the home of Ralph St. Leger.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
DEATH-NOTCH IN TROITJ1.E.
After leaving his cabin, Iialph St Leger made a careful circuit of the hut. then moved out toward the wood*. Ilero he caught sight of a shadowy figure moving uwav before him. He followed it, for, without a doubt, it was a skulking euemy. It led into the woods, where the darkness was so intense that he was not eiabled to follow it otherwise than bv sound. Hut he could hear the footstejw very plain. They were heavy aud massive, unlike that of an Indian warrior, yet it was the footsteps of a prowling enemy.
Out some fifty yard* in the wood, Ralph was suddenly startled by a quick step at his right. He halted. At that instant he heai'S a "whirr" over his head, then he feels something encircle his form like the folds of a huge serpent. He feels this band drawn suddenly tight. His hands are pinioned at his side. He struggles but his efforts only tend to tighten the clasp. He is jerked to his knees, then he is thrown prostrate upon the earth; he is within tho toils of a lasso, a captiva. A dozen savages dose in upon him. He struggles with the desperation of a madman, but the heavy blow of a club strikes him half-unconscious.
The scene changes. It is still night, and in the forest a camp-fire is burning. Its rays, reaching outward and upward, strike upon the green foliage of the trees, seeming to transform them into gray rock towering aloft and forming a deep chasm, whose grim, stonv facade was, apparently, dappled with sunlig'ht, yet whose opening was lost in the darkness above.
Around this camp-fire half a dozen savages are moving hurriedly to and fro, their grim faces aglow with demoniac triumph. The cause of their excitement is readily manifested. Before them stands a white captive, whose hands are bound before biin, and the ends of the thongs securely attached to a sapling.
Tho captive is Ralph St. Leger. His head is bore; he is stripped of everything but his trow -sere and hunting-shirt. He is perfectly resigned. There is no look of fear nor dejection in his fine dark eyes. He regards the vengeful spirit of his captors indifferently, and a smile of admiration passes over his face when he sees they are preparing for his torture.
A number of arrow-points are thrust into the fire, and a strong bow got in readiness for use. Then a Ravage warrior jmints to these and tells the captive what they are for. and. by mocks and jeers, endeavors to mak-* him show some signs of fear. But tin captive Iwy heeds not his words.
“The youiflt p	• i< like tV young tree
against which lie stands.” said the •■avago, growing indignant at bis success as a mocker; "he hears not the voice of the wind. But when the ax is cut into the bark, it is made to feel. It will wither and die. The pale-face boy shall feel."
The speaker was a young warrior about the age of the captive. He was the child of a chief —was brave and ilaring, and honored for the acalps ho bad taken. He was small aud slender, yet agile as the panther, and strong as a young Uon. As he concluded his threat, the young chief turned, took up a bow. plucked an arrow ■—whose point was ablaze—from the flre, and applied it to the bow-string.
He then stepi>ed backward, drew the arrow almost to the head, and sent it whirring at the breast of the captive. The barbed and blazing point pierced the hunting shirt of the captive, who flinched not. Tho weapon hail only passed in until the barbs were concealed behind tho shirt, yet it must have punctured the skin, for a little jet of smoke puffod outward, while the shaft of tho arrow dropped downward, still clinging within the shirt by its barbs.
The savagee watch the faoe of the captive for some manifest sign of pain, but he never flinches. The features do not relax their firmness of expression.
Another burning arrow was plucked from the flre and Bhot into the breast of the captive. Little puffs cf smoko curl upward from the bosom of the hunting-shirt. It had a pungent odor, not unlike that of burning flesh. Still the captive flinches not, but smiles defiantly in the face of his foes.
Arrow after arrow was shot into his breast, until It bristled with tho feathered shafts, and tke	was beginning to smoke and
■asrisp with heat. There was something strange —yea. mysterious—in the fortitude of this won-
, derful boy. He broke into a mocking, defiant laugh.
“Shoot your arrows, you red fiends,” he said. !“ Fill my breast with them. Then they will not burn as my hatred of your accursed race does I” I “Waugn!” exclaimed the young chief. “A bird in a cage will sing Sweet, when its heart is sad, and the young pale-face t-alfra brave to conceal the pain that Durns within its breast”
“ Wild-Wind’s tongue is crooked os the serpent's trail,” replied our fearless boy.
Wild-Wind, the young chief, sprung toward the captive and dealt him a severe blow upon the head with the bow he held in his band
“ Lot the pale-face feel but half the weight of my arm," replied tho insulted chief, “ anil let him fear me as he would Death-Notch, the voung Scalp-Hunter.”
‘•Wild-Wind is a coward, or he would not strike a prisoner.” replied the youthful captive: “ he is a weak squaw, a sucking wolf.”
Again Wild-YE ind dealt him a blow. But this was more than human nature—at least, such a nature as Ralph St. Legor’s—could stand. The eyes of the youth flashed with a deadly flre of resentment.' The great veins in his neck stood out like cordage. The face became set with a terrible expression. The breast heaved and tho arms twitched as with convulsions. The power of Titan seemed infused into the frame of the captive. His arms are pressed gradually ajKirt. Ills bonds snap in twain, and he stands free before liis enemies. But it is only for a moment. Before a savage could move—with t he swiftness of a dart, he grasps the shafts of the arrows in his breast with one band, and tearing them out. hurled them, shafts forward, at the nearest savage. Then seizing a heavy, half-consumed firebrand. he swung it aloft and s»ept the astounded foe down before him. The end of the club burst into a flame, and as it swept through the air like a hissing stream of fire, it threw'a ghastly light over the features of the now mad avenger.
The rod foes regained their feet and pressed hard ut>on him. Knives were thrust at his breast, but glanced off as though they had come in contact with the breast of a brazen image.
Foremost among the savage combatants is Wild-Wind. But the eye of Death-Notch has marked him. He presses toward him: he roaches him: he seizes him in a grasp by the throat that causes his eves to start and his tongue to protrude. With the other hand he seizes him by the loin-cloth and raises him above his bead, as though he hod been.a mere c!hild, and with all liis strength ho dashes him with crushing force iuto the fire. Then he ntters a wild, terrible yell, and with a bound he gains the darkuess and freedom of the woods.
Bleeding, blinded and burned. Wild-Wind was dragged from the fire, and he at once slunk away into the forest, while the warriors bounded away is the pursuit. But the footsteps of the voung pale-face wero silent as the wind, and the baffled savages soon returned to look after their disabled young chief.
But they found lam not. On the ground where he bad fallen lay the savage first brained by the terrible firebrand. His -face was turned upward; his head was scalpless. „His arm was outstretched and raised slightly from the ground, while the index finger was pointing, in a manner as natural as life, to a little tree upon which was cut a fresh notrh!
The savages know at once what it meant.
The young Scalp-Hunter had been there!
CHAPTER XXIX.
AN ASrUSING ADVENTrrtE.
Little did Fred Travis dream of the eyes i that were fixed upon him the moment he left the 1 door of the St. Legers’ cabin. But he had
■	scarcely reached the woods when a scream fell | upon his ears. It came from the cabin, and he knew the girls must be in trouble, so turning about he ran back to the house. As he nearea : the door he saw there was no light within, and 1 he beard the excited voices of savages and the ! terrified screams of Vida and Sylveen.
The brave youth made a dash at the door, but it was blocked with savage forms. He attempted to cut his way through but in vain. The foe closed in upon him and Beat him down.
The next minute he was helpless in bonds, and was compelled to witness, with all the agony his heart could suffer, his adored little Vida and Sylveen Gray conducted from the cabin and hurried away toward the woods.
Then he, too. was compelled to rise, and follow his captors away, but in a different direction from that taken by the maidens and their captors.
A few minutes more and the home of Balph and Vida St. Leger was In flames.
Fred was conducted due northward by about a dozen warriors, who seemed to fear pursuit, and traveled quite rapidly. The shadows of the forest did not deter them in the least in their haste. In fact darkness was preferable to them, for under its friendly cover, they had little to feax.
At daybreak, however, they came to a halt to seek the rest and refreshment that even a savage needs at times. They stopped id a litile
wooded valley close to tie edge of a treeteat shrubless slope of ground that arose gradually several hundred yards, where it again joined the timber. This beautiful opening faced the south, and was covered with a growth of short grass.
Fred was lashed to a tree so that he could tti down, -and availing himself of this favor, ho leaned his aching head against the tree-trunk, and was soon absorbed in his agonizing reflections.
What a fate had been his! Where now were the Avengers? Where was Death-Notchf and. above all others, where was Vida—his darling little Vida?
As the savages were entirely dependent or> their rifle for food, a warricr was dispatched at once in quest of game. It was their scout. He was a tall, lithe-looking fellow with an ey« of steel and powerful muscles.
Crossing the hillside opening, he entered th« deep woods beyond He had traversed its shadows but a few steps when a low clump of bushes before tiim suddenly parted, and a white, angu. lar face confronted him, and a gruff voic* said:
“ Hold on thar. ye duroed red vagabone, ve; hold on, I say. or down goes yer meat-house.1’ Quick as a' flash the savage dropped himself upon the ground, thereby bringing a large fallen log between him and this unexpected enemy.
Old Shadow, for he the white man was. was in the act of leaping over the log when he discovered the muzzle of the Indian’s rifle, and his dark eye gleaming along the barrel, leveled at his breast. Before he could flre, however, the old hunter dropped himself on the opposite side of the log. In this position they lay as silent as though they had been shot, each one waiting the movements of the other.
it was rather a novel situation for the two deadly foes, and, as it so happened, neither of them possessed other weapon than a rifle and knife. The former they could not use in their present situation, and the latter was of no use onlv in a hand-to-hand encounter.
Stratagem wr.s the only expedient. Either one could have sprung to his feet and fled before the other had time to flre, but, where two such foes meet they never turn—never flinch before the tomahaw-k or rifle, even were it certain death to stand Several minutes passed by. The Indian lay as silent as the log, bnt the white man became restless and impatient, but finally broke off cn his favorite song, “ The old hedgehog, etc.”
•• Ugh!” burst from the savage’s lips when h* bad concluded his song.
“ Ye duraed red hog,” retorted the hunter, “whRt ve gruntin’ at round thar! Show ver greasy skin if ye want it punctuated I'm t'ld Shader, old p’izen. or old ennything, and I'll 1 et a picayune that I ldn whale a dozen o’ ye. Jest show yerself, red-skin; come, trot out, ole boss, and show yer dirty self.
"Waugn!” replied the savage, indignantly. “ Heap much big blow round there. Whit* coward, pale-face dog barkin'.’*
" ('oropliment’rv, thank ye, red-skin,” said Old Shadow, maneuvering about so as to get a shot or thrust at the savage, but wherever he attempted to peep over or around at the cunning red-skin, he would see the muzzle of his rifle just coming into view.
The old hunter knew that the savage was possessed of a patience that would keep him there a week, rather than make any risky demonstration. On the other hand, the savage was well aware that the white man would soon grow impatient, and resort to some trick to dislodge him, so he had only to remain on the defensive to insure himself of speedy action and certain victory. The Sioux lad estimated the old hunter's patience and daring rashness by that of the general average of white hunters. In so doing ho had underrated the old hunter’s ex-(jerience.
For some time Old Shadow tried to draw the savago out, so as to enable him to get a shot. The log was entirely too large for him to reach over and feel for the savage with his knife. Once ho elevated his cap on his rifle in hopes of drawing the foe’s flre, but he raised it half an inch too high, and the savage saw the gun-bar-rel under it.
"See here, ye cowardly bugger,” he at last exclaimed, “if you don’t leave over thar in a jiffy I’ll squash the eternals outen ye.”
1 Ugh! all blow—no do,” was the rejoinder. By tapping slightly upon the log, the old scout found it was hollow and so, bracing his feet against a small bush, he applied bis shoulder to the log. and, with a desperate-effort, succeeded in rolling it toward the Indian. He had hoped by so doing to roll it on the savage, but ho was too cunning to be caught thus, and retreat ed as the log advanced, yet kept himelf in tie same position behind the log.
The old hunter managed to roll the log oat into the opening; that sloped downward to the Indian camp. Hers the savage contrived to stop it.
They were now within fair view of the Indian camp, which was not over three hundred yards away. The savage could easily hav»

Old Shadow was fully aware of his cloj'1 proximity to the enemy’s camp, and he iaaw. If they discovered their friend’s situation, curiosity would bring them there at o^ce. Consequently, he knew he would havo to bring matters to a speedy termination. But how was he to do it J He had, so far, ioond the savage ready for any emergency.
However, a thought soon struck him, bringing a smile to his knotty face, and, as he proceeded to carry it into execution, he began humming his favorite song.
He cut a long, tough switch that was with;-of him, and, with his knife in one h*nd and tho rod in the other, he was rs?c«y for work.
“ Seo here, login, ’round ihtjy he said, “ain’t ye gittin’ a leetls tLM o'yer sitchua-shunr

“ Ugli!' was the only response. But it was enough. It told tbe old scout exactly where he Was lying.
“Now, look sharp, ye nasty beast; Pm goin’ to tan yer jacket for ye.”
As he concluded, he raised the switch aloft brought it down over the log with all his power. Being tough and pliable, it lapped easily around the log, and, being of sufficient lwnyth, its end came down across the naked back of the ml-skin with such stinging force that it caused him to fairlv bounce, and forced a low cry from his lips. The savage knew not from whenjc the blow came, and for an instac* he grappled, with staring eyes, at an imagim. foe.
The old hunter followed up with anr ,.er blow that forced a genuine yell fro— t. ^.v-age’s lips.
He knew now from whence th;/ c.-wr.e,
“ I know it's orful ticklish, i-^-skin: but ve'll have to take it, or shin ou'. Ye're a bad boy, ye are.”
“ Warrupl’’ warruo!’' came the switch over the log and on the re l-stan's back, causing liim to yell till he could have been heard for miles. 7. was a new lirturo to him—one that his ails... fortitude „uld not stand.
The j-"'ages at tho camp heard his they 'culd see him writhing about agrsTrt the log, but could not tell the cause of h: .i’ouble. The log concealed Old Shadow from tus:r view. However, they started up the cill to their friend’s assistance: but, at thij juncture, they saw something on the edge o. tho opening that caused them to fall back .gain.

Great excitement prevailed in the Indian oamp, not only over their friend’s adventure, tut tho appearance of nearly a dozen of whites •on the upper side of the opening. It was the

When be was sure Fred understood his intentions, he drew his knife, and, reaching out, severed his bonds. Then be glided from the log, anil the next instant the two passed into the woods, and not until they were out of gunshot did tho savages realize the state of affairs in the rear.

At a signal from tho young captain, Omaha and Old Shadow came in, when a general un-! derstanding was had all around. Fred Travis I was to lead as captain of the band._

Again they came to a nalt. Scouts ware out toward the town to reconnoiter the "dto.,r ation, and calculate their changes of reeentnjv-tho prisoners.
Omaha and Old Shadow were tbe scoots cent forward, but soon after their departure, Ralph went too. It was dark—pitchy dark—^when the two scouts came in sight of the town. A hundred camp-fires marked the location of the place, and showed our two triends the round, conical lodges, and the dusky forms of warriors stalking about or standing before tbe fire, like bronze statues. In the background were hitched ;i ■ number of ponies, bridled as if for instant use.

Old Shadow saw that all was up with him. He was being strangled to death, and '.very movement of his body added to his pain. Hi grew weaker each moment. His eves started from their sockets and his tongue from hil mouth. A purple haze was gathering before his eyes. Feebly be clutched at the arm of the savage, who now seemed magnified into a bofng of colossal stature.
To the old scout the dark belt of timber aroond the glade seemed spinning around ond-oround. Direful sounds—shrieking demons and wailing winds rushed athwart the night. And from the borders of darkness—the woods—he sees a dark, shaggy form appear. It comes with a lumber* ing gait. Two orbs of fire gleam from the shtg* gy mass like the eyes of doom. The moonbeam* falling upon it give it a weird and terrible appearance. But there is still life enongh left fot Old Shadow to sec what it is. A huge blae> bear.

Old Shadow gasped for breath, and stagger, ing, fell to the earth. Ho soon regained his strength and breath, however, nnd rising to hlfl feet, exclaimed:

Death~Not
Destroyer.
The Friendly gave him o muttered reply, and, as retreat would likely arouse suspicion, he waited boldly up and seated himself on the log by the guard; though he kept his hand on his tomahawk.
The canning sentinel seemed to be a little sn*-piciou'i of tho scout, and lswiing forward he peered into his very faco. The next instant Omah',.,3 tomahawk was buried tc tho eye in his Uiv.in. and with scarcoly a shudder, the Sioux gunk to the earth.
This deed was done so silently that it,suggested a daring adventure to the scout. Ho divested himself of his own clothing and donned that of tho dead Sioux, from moccasins to head-dress. Then a few skillful touches o£ war-paint—which the Omaha always carried—changed him into a Sioux, and with the giiard’s blanket around his shoulders, his rifle in his hand, the youth turned and strode into the village with a holdness that served its purpose and aroused no suspicion. The savages were hurrying to and fro through the village in no little excitement They seemed upon the eve of some event of unusual character.
Omaha soon found that his disguise was perfect, yet he did not betray the least sign of curiosity. He kept constantly on the move, pas sin--from lodge to lodge to ascertain whether or not there were any captives in tho village. Ho found nothing, and would have departed at once had he not been a little desirous of knowing what the savages meant by the hasty and ixdted stirring about. Had it only been a temporary encampment he would have at once concluded the- were going to break camp, but it oeing their permanent village he was thrown into a quandary, from which he resolved to relieve himself.
He mingled with the largest parties, and in moving about with them, finally found himself near tne tent of the Great Medicine. This dignitary he knew was a white man. He had learned it from one who had once been a captive in the hands of the Sioux. He was satisfied ho was a cowardly villain, who, knowing the sacrednes3 with which he was guarded, never dreamed that an enemy could possibly get into his tent. Acting upon this belief, Omaha raised the fiap-door ana entered the lodge.
The Medicine-man sat upon a deep pile of skins, enveloped in the folds of a curious yet beautifully wrought blanket, and smoking a pipe on the head of his tomahawk.
He scarcely moved his head when Omaha entered, but. when the latter addressed him in a iow tone, he glanced quickly up at him, as if he penetrated his disguise through the medium of his voice. Then Be replied in a tone that was iow and guttural in its accents. But now it was Omaha’s turn to stare.
The Medicine-man seemed to notice his embarrassment, and began puffing away at his pipe until his head ana face had disappeared from Omaha’s sight, in a cloud of smoke.
“What does the young brave want in the lodge of the great Medicine T' the man of herbs finally asked.
. “ He comes for words that will cure his heart of the dread of Death-Notch, the pale-face that aunts for Sioux scalps.”
“Then the young warrior’s heart is cowardly."
“I have taken many scalps in battle, and does not every heart tremble at the name of Death-Notchr
“Ye?; the young Scalp-Huntcr is a terrible foe, yet he is but mortal. Arrows or bullets wel1 aimed will slay him But you are not in fear of him. You are disguised. You are an enemy to the Sioux—you are Omaha, tho Friendly.”
The young scout grasped his tomahawk; but, before he could ra&o it, the Medicine laid his upon hifl arm and ;
“Let Omaha have no fear of me! Iknowwhy you are here—the same for which I came. The Medicine-man lies dead under the skins I sit upon. Look. Omaha, at that lodge-pole. It bears a notch upon it 7 cut it there 1 I am Death-Notch 1 Go leave me quick; you look so like a Sioux that I might slay you. Go back to those that await you, and tell them that the.-e are many captives here, and that Inkpaducah is preparing to move his village at daybreak.”
Omaha waited for no further orders or information, but left the lodge and soon worked him-
-	fwwn tVin
their information to their friends. When Omaha narrated his adventure with Death- ] Notch in the lodge of the Medicine, a smilo was j seen to play about the lips of Ralph St. Leger, but none save Fred Travis and Omaha knew its i import.
Now arose the question: how were the captives to be rescued! The question was eastor asked than answered, for the enemy were : 'fty to one, and would have to be attacked within their own stronghold. However, the captives mnst be rescued at all hazards, and the little band resolved to make the atte. .pt ihat night-near morning.
So a guard was posted, and the band lay down to get a few hours rest and deep before the time for the ordeal came. But no :;leep came to the eyes of one of the party. They all lay upon the hard earth, thinking of the oming conflict and its probable result. They had 'tfle upon which to base a single hope of vict ry, but men under such circumstances are determined and desperate. They never let a fear or doubt stay a resolution.
Each one of the little band, unle- it was Old Shadow, had pictured to himself the rescue of *. friend—either a sweeth^.rt, sister or mother. Even Omaha had hopes of meeting friends taken captive by the Sioux in their raid upon the Omaha country.
When the hour for action had come, every man was upon his feet, with rifle in hand, and under the guidance of Old Shadow, they set ofl toward the Indian village.
As they neared the town they were not a little surprised at the deep silence that prevailed around the place. Not the bark of a dog oould be heard, nor the glimmer of a dying camp-fire seen. All was wrapt in profound silence and darkness. There were, howerver, voices in the wilderness. The sharp bark of a wolf hanging on the outskirts of the village, the “ who-who hoo ” of the owl, and the wailing of insects could be heard all around.
“Dummy ole riggin’!” exclaimed Old Shadow, “ things seem a little dull and glam down thar. I reckon as what Death-Notch pnt a damper on their spirits when he caved in the clamshell of their ole Medicine humbug, and they've all gone into mournin’ over it”
“Ught” ejaculated Omaha, “that silenoe mean something else—something unusual.”
“ It is singular that not a sound can be heard . from the village,” said Fred Travis.
“ All in bed, I reckon,” said Old Shadow, “ and I’d give a picayune to knock the bottom out and heave the whole caboodle into the 1 sulphur diggin’s. But see here, boyees, I’ll make a leetle feel down to’r’ds the camp and see what’s up."
“ Very well; we will remain here till you return,” said Travis.
The old scout took his departure, and something like half an hour had elapsed when he was heard coming toward them, singing-
“The ’possum he grinned at the ole hedgehog.
At the ole hedgehog, at the ole—" i “ Hark, there!” suddenly demanded Pbeli* O’Ray, “yees will arrhouse the whole Injring counthry wid that bell-clapper ave youra, Dem it, man, what do ye maner i “ Givin’ vent to’ the exuberance of my spir’ts I anLvoung Ireland,” replied the scout.
Well, what discovery, old friend?” asked Travis.
“ The red varlets have gone—every cuss o ’em—weemen, men, brats and all.” i “ What! broke camp?” exclaimed St. Leger.
“ Yes; Death-Notch’s doin’ must hev’ hurried 'em up a leetle. They went westward, and mj ’pinion is they’ll not stop this side o’ the Big ! Muddy.”
I “ Boys,” said St. Leger, and his voice was sac and low, “ I am afraid it will be a long time ere ! our hojios are realized, if they ever are. But what say you, Avengers? Shall we take uj their trail and follow them, or not!”
“Follow them!—trail them to death!” criec Fred Travis, and his words were repeated bj ! every tongue.	_
CHAPTER XXXIL
ON THE TRAIL.
At early dawn the following morning, th< Avengers were upon the trail.
I From the course taken by the Sioux, it wai | evident they were aiming for the country be l—^^iij-a£iamnEL-gtg<»r They had every ad
twenty feet in hight, interlaced withcwlid grape-vines and creepers, oovered the. face of tho Dluffs, and extending down into the bottom, blocked from view the entranoe to the defile.
Once within the defile, it could only be left by the way it was entered, for the cliffs on aU rides W£re perpendicular, and in some places -.helving. It was dork when our friends reached this secluded spot. For fear of danger, tlisy did not strike a fire. It is well they did not, for Omaha, who had been pot on fjuard, soon made his appearance in camp and said:
“We are in danger. Three score of Sioux warriors have encamped on the plain near the mouth of the defile.”
“By snakes!” exclaimed Old Shadow, “ that’s a fact, for I can sniff the. smoke o’ their cam]>-fire this blessed minit. Ah, there goes a rod varlet’s bazzoo.”
“ I’m afraid we’re in a close place, ” said Ralph St. Leger.
"Bet a picayune on it, Ralph,” said th« hunter; “if they don’t know we’re here now they’ll find it out purtv soon in the momin’, ot ye may take my mouth for a fly-trap."
" I presume we have not been as cautious we should have been, if we have let savages coop us up in this defile," said Fred Travis.
“Wal, I’ll tell ye, younker, we can come Death-Notch on’t and cut our way out of here ruther than perish. But list lay low and things may all work out right ylt.”
And, acting upon this advice, guards were posted wherever there was the least chance of a savage approaching; then those not on duty lay down to rest.
The night wore away, and morning dawned clear and bright; and as the sun glanoed across the plain, the Avengers saw the danger that menaced them. Fully three score of savage warriors were encamped on the plain, close up to the little clump of oaks that stood like a door at the month of the defile. Their animals were picketed to grass west of the camp. A row of lances, stack in the ground, were aligned in a semicircle about the camp, and at the foot of each weapon lay its owner’s side-arms and horse-equipage.
They were upon the war-path. This our friends could tell by their paintand the absencs of females. But why had they encamped there?
Our friends saw them build small fires and broil venison upon them. This done, they eat their meal in silence. Then some strolled out along tho base of the cliffs, while others lounged about in listless, idle attitudes that convinced the Avengers they had gone into temporary encampment for, no telling how long, nor foi what purpose.
This was an unfortunate state of affairs fo.-our friends. They could not make their exitt from the defile by a rear passage. If they would escape at all, it must be made through the defile where they bad entered, in the very face of the foe.
Toward noon several of the warriors had mounted their ponies, took up their lance* and galloped away toward the south.
“ Blast ’em!” muttered Old Shadow, “the royal ole devil’s in ’em red-skins, boys. We’re elected for a day or two, ennyhow. . Them lopin’ bounds are goin’ off on a hunt They’ve proberly diskiverea a herd o’ buffalo."
“ Time will tell,” said Ralph St Leger. “ We have only got to be quiet and patient. If Che savages do not discover our trail leading into the defile, we may escape them."
An hour or more had passed when a yell of a savage triumph was heard far over the plain. Our friends turned their eyes in the direction from whence the sound came, and saw the warrior8 that had left camp returning. They were leading two riderless horses, and on the point of a lance two reeking scalps were dangling. These spoke plainer than words of what had taken them from qunp. The horses thsy led were of the new American stock, spirited and mettlesome, and had evidently belonged to white men.
When the savages entered camp they were greeted with a joyous shout. They drew rein, thrust their spears in the ground and dismounted. They tethered their ponies at grass again; but the two captured animals were retained in camp to be admired and commented upon.
Presently two athletic - looking warriors* stripped of all their clothing bat the loin-cloth, came forward and mounted the fretting, chaf-

by the hits and threw it back upon tie haunches, others seized the savase, and. dragging him to the earth, bound and gagged him before he could give the alarm. Not a sound, likely to create suspicion, wa* made. But, what now were our mends to do with him? Hif non-appearance would soon bring friends into the defile In search of him. Then escape would be impossible.
Omaha was put on the watch, and he saw that the savages on the plain had turned their heads and were watching the savage that was riding over the prairie, though now and then they would glanoe anxiously toward the chaparral at the mouth of the defile.
“What do ye say to do with the blarsted skunk, boys?” asked Old 8hadow; “come, belch out yer ’pinion, fur we’ve not a minit to lose.”
“ No, time is precious. This Indian must be got out of here at once, or every red-skin will be upon xu.”
“ That’s the caokle, and I perpoee we send him outen here a-flunldn' replied Old Shadow.
“How will we do itP1 asked young Harriot
“ Bind him on the back of this hoss. put a burr under the critter’s tail, turn him loose, and let it go outen the defile.”
The savage seemed to have understood the old hunter's words, and the look he fixed upon him fairly caused him to wince.
“It will be our only chance, boys,” Fred Travis said, in reply to the old hunter, “ and if it works snocessf ully, the attitude of the savage on the horse may draw the attention of his friends so as to give us an opportunity to escape from the defile, and hide ourselves in the adjacent chaparral."
“That's the cackle, Freddy,” said the huntor; “now, let’s lift the stinkin’sinner to the boss’s back. There, np he goes—steady, hossl Here, one o’ ye pull off the critter’s halter and bridle to tie the varlet cm with."
The bridle and halter were taken off the trembling beast, and while St Leger held him by the muzzle, the others bound tne savage to -the beast’s back.
When the task was oompleted, the animal’s head was turned down the defile, then one of the avengfers gave it a cut with a keen switch that soot it plunging in madness and affright down the stony valley.
Liko an arrow it shot from tho chaparral out onto the plain, and. with glowing eyes and dilated nostrils, it dashed through the camp of the savages, trampling down the warriors that appeared in its path, and plunging wildly and madly on over the prairie.
The savages stood dumbfounded and amazed. They could scarcely realize the perilous situation of their friend, nor the manner in which he had gotten into such a dilemma. The change from tho free rider to the helpless, bound prisoner, as it were, was made so quick that they ooula attribute liis situation to no other source than his own free and fearless will
They believed he put himself in that position to mace a more startling display of his feats of horsemanship and wonderful daring, but, when his cries for help rung out over the plain, they supposed he had become entangled in the gearings of the animal. Wild with excitement, some of the warriors dashed away on foot in pursuit of the flying steed, while thoee that took
•	second thought mounted their ponies and spurred away.
Omaha, the look-out, at once reported the run of affairs. The camp was deserted by all but half a dozen warriors.
“ Let us wait until the others are out of gunshot,” said Balph St. Leger; “ then we can make a charge upon thoee in camp, drive them off, and mount some of their best ponies and flee. ’
“Bravol” exclaimed Old Shadow; “yon’vo got the right vim about you. A hoes will be quite an item to mo, while to a hoss I’d be a mere shader.”
At this juncture Omaha informed them that the savages were a quarter of a milo away in hot pursuit of the flying steed and its hapless burden.
“Then, forward, boys,” exclaimed young | Travis; “make your aim certain, and your choice of a pony good.”
Like shadows the Avengers glided from the defile, through the chaparral, and out onto tho plain.
Then followed the clash of fire-arms, mingled vifch yells of terror and shouts of victory.
Tho savages that do not fall under the Avengers’ fire flee across the plain, while the white foe dash through their camp toward their ponies.
It required hut a Tew seconds for the men to flelect a good pony each and mount it; but, by this time the other savages had discovered what was going on at camp, and had turned back upon the Avengers. But the latter had got several rods the start, and the ponies that ihsy did not appropriate they managed to stnm-

of the fire, now that it has carried me beyoad immediate peril.”
“ Nor I,” repeated his companions.
They galloped along at a slow pace, convolving in an undertone, when, suddenly, their laded animals pricked up their ears and sniffed the air unodsily.	s>i
“Boys/’said Death-Notch, “there is dsugar about These animals—”
He did not finish the sentence. A terrib/s sound rushed suddenly athwart the darkness. It was a sound resembling the roll of thunder— deep-toned and awful—low at first, but gradually gathering volume of sound. But it was not thunder. The sky was clear. Besides that, sound seemed rolling along the face of the earth. There was no doubt of this, for they could feel the very ground trembling under their hoofs.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
A BUKFALO-CHA8K.
The day was two-thirds gone. The sky t»w clear and the sun shone hot and sultry. Th\ great Nebraska plain lay glimmering witfc waves of heat, as though an internal fire wok burning beneath its surface, j A herd of buffalo along a small stream that found its way into the Platte river, was the only | object to be seen upon that plain. The shaggr 1 beasts were panting with heat. Some were wal-) lowing in the creek, others lolling beneath s j fringe of willows, while others were rummaging about in the tall grass with restless impa-I tience. Jhey seemed to rest in perfect securfty4 . for not even a skulking coyote was to be seen.
I Far away upon the crest of a prairie wave, j however, a pair of black eyes were eagerly watching them. They were the eyes of an In-[ dian warrior. But, why should lie be watching : the buffalo!
I He kept his black, covetous eyes upon then j for several minutes, and when he had assured : himself that they had not detected his presence,
! lie turned and crawled away through the grass,
■ and when the crest of the hill concealed him from | view of the buffalo, he arose to his'feet and : continued a few jiaces further on, when he came 1 in sight of a band of mounted warriors drawn | up in line in the valley below.
With his hand the Indian motioned to them,
I whereupon the whole party, numbering some thirty, galloped up the nill and drew rein before . their scout.
( The latter quickly communicated to them the ' position of the buffalo, and the way by which j they might be approached as near as possible,
1 without giving the alarm.
The savages were not all red-men. There 1 were whites and lialf-breeds in the party, btrt j they were no less savage and brntal-looldng tlian their companions. They were all welf ; mounted, and their trappings showed that they were a hunting party. Some carried rifles,
I others lances, and a few carried lassoes of nr hide.
I No sooner had the scout given tho situatio.
I of tho herd, than the whole band moved can | tiously around the hill, thereby availing them selves of every possible screen that would enable them to approach nearer the buffalo without being seen. As they were to the leeward of the herd, they succeeded is getting within two hundred yards of them, when an old bull detected their presence, and with a snort, he dashed along down the creek ] witha low bellow, arousing his companions from their noontide siesta.
Then forth from the cool shade of the willow* and the water, the buffalo went pouring in ons continual stream, their hoof-strokes sounding like the sullen roar of thunder. For fully a mile along the creek the huge, shaggy beasts came charging out from among the willow* i with a snort and bellow, and swept away ovei the plain liko a mighty wave, rising and falling with the'undulations of the great prairie.
With whoop and yell the savages gave pursuit, pressing their animals forward at the top of their speed.
For over a mile the chase continued with but little advantage to the pursuers, for upon such a hot, sultry plain it was impossible for either man or beast to exert themselves to their utmost for a great length of time. And among those thousands of shaggy forms it was impossible for the weak ones to hold out with the stronger, and soon the pursuers saw that stragglers were falling in the rear. There were both cows and calves among the lagging, but the lntter were the most desirable of all for food.
The savages pressed on, and two or three fin. .calves were soon secured, but it was a grand hunt, and not until darkness fell would the chaan close.
The herd spread out over tho plain with * front of a mile, and as the shadows of evening came on and the air grew more vibrant, th« pounding of the hoofs on the plain fairly, shook it to its center.
Still the hunters pressed on. One by Oise the herd fell. The trail lay strewn with carcasses; some had been shot and others Impaled with lances. The chase once over, the hunters will fo bfck anrf s<>cvrc •he m«st desirable of thisn.
Tb«	-v 'vt>*d/'%. »>es>in t* fpD. Twf
The young Avenger* headed directly toward tbs Missouri river, over five miles away. Tha plain, to the river’s bank, was an unbroken waste of smooth, level prairie, covered with a growth of tall grass, that brushed the knees of the riders.
After an exciting ride the river was reached, but its banks offered our friends no advantages of defense; and, with a fearlessness and daring so remarkably characteristic of the true border-men, they spurred their animals into the turbulent current of the great river, and, after a fearful struggle with the waves, succeeded in swimming to tho opposite shore, though the current had carried them over a quarter of a mile down the stream. But, before they had scarcely put the river between themselves and the foe, the latter appeared on the opposite shore.
With a yell of defiance, the fugitives pressed •on into the dense Nebraska forest.
The savages, burning mad with a thirst for vengeance, pressed their animals into the water, and swam the river also, and continued the chase.
For several miles now their course lay through a wooded valley, and our friends did not rido in a body nor line, but scattered out, so as to make their trail more difficult to follow. But, in so doing they endeavored to keep within sight of each other.
After on hour or more riding through the woods, they debouched into a groat Nebraska plain, stretching away for leagues and leagues into the hazy distance.
Death-Notch was the first upon the plain. He drew rein. One by one his compiunon.H came from the woods on either side of him. until all were present but Old Shadow. They waited for him, but he did not come, and the party were sorely uneasy about him.
Seeing he Sid not mako his appearance, Ralph St Leger asked:
“ Who of you, boys, saw him after we scattered out?”
“ Faith and mees seo’d him once, aud it was far behind he was,” said Phelix O’Ray, “ for it war a sorry ould divil of a baste he war riding. He war using heel, whip and tongue to make the Critter keep up, but about played out he war, sure now. Mees s’pects the red niggers hev got tho poor old bag-ov-boues.”
“Too bad, too bad,” said Fred Travis: “but hark! I hear the yells of the red demons—they are in the woods—they are after us! Let us away.”
They again turned their animals’ heads westward and rode on. Ever and anon they looker! back in hopes of seeing Old Shadow emerge from the woods. But their hopes were in vain: he came not But they did see the savages come out of tho woods on their trail They were over two miles away, yet our friends could see tliat they were not pursuing under whip, but riding leisurely on.
Our friends aimed to keep the same distance between themselves and the savages. This they were enabled to do, however, without riding as bard as usual.
The sun declined slowly westward. It wanted an hour of sunset when they discovered that the savages had given up the pursuit entirely—that they were nowhere to be seen. There was something singular about this—something which induced them to believe it meant them no good.
It was now sunset, and they were debating the subject of going into camp. Some were in f&vor of continuing on, but before they could decide upon either course, they suddenly discovered a dense black smoke rolling heavenward far behind them.
“ What does that mean?” asked one.
*■ Look,” said Omaha, pointing down at the ground.
All saw at once what he meant. Although it was midsummer, and the plain was covered with a growth of green grass, the old fog, or last year’s growth, still remained, and was dry and combustible as tinder.
It was this old grass that their savage pursuers had flrod, and the light breeze was carrying it directly toward them. There was nothing to be feared from this fire but suffocating by tho hot. fetid smoke.
Tne green grass would keep the flames in check, from sweeping onward like an irresistible wave, but the smoke arising therefrom would soon cover the face of the great plain, and make it impossible for one to live and breathe under it. This the savages knew, and they had fired the prairie with the intention of smoking the Avengers across the plain, and in all probability, into some trap which they had or would have prepared.
As the shadows of night continued to gather, the light of the burning prairie bogan to shoot athwart the sky, and roll in dull, lurid waves down toward them with no little rapidity.
“ Let ns press on, boys, a little faster." Baid young Travis; “ if tne wind should • gain strength, it will scatter the smoke over the whole plain and suffocate us. If, however, we should oome to a water-course, we might make a halt and escape the dangers of the fire. But I will not consent to desert my potty to the mercy 1

^Hghl.'.jjpeas i»to <tarknea». Still the chase goes on, Oii-, oue by ono the savages hare dropped off, Santil uiere ore but three or four now in pur-Vsuit. One of these is a white man—a huge, j burly fellow of giant strength. He carries a heavy laaso in his hand, and his eyes are set
•	upon a fine young bull. He has been watching ' itfor some time with the intention of lassoing
K
In their headlong flight the beasts dash through a marshy slough, and the feet of those : beforo trample it into such a mire that a number of tho stragglers were “ swamped."
Hero the white renegade was successful. The object of his eye sunk partly in the miro, and before it could extricate itself, the fatal noose had eueireled its neck. He then learned, for the first, time, that it had been the object of two or three of his companions, who rushed up to claim It But the renegade’s claim was undeniable, and he forbade his friends slaying it. It was bis, and he then and there avowed his intention of leading it back to the camp alive, as a witness ; of his skill with the lasso.
This was something new as well as novel, and companions assisted him to secure the young beast while it was still tangled in the raeslies of therope and the mire.
At tms juncture a new party of savages made Its appearance, coming from tho east There . wore about a dozen ot them, and friends of the hunters. In their midst was a white prisoner.
It was Old Shadow.
An understanding was at once had between the two parties. Many and dark were the , yoowls of hatred cast at the old hunter, and a murmur of vengeance was upon every lip.
After some further consultation, one of the (ate party of savages arose to his feet and ad-’ dressed the warriors in words of great elo-gosnoe. Old Shadow was the subject of his jpoech, and he proved to be the identical savage ; not the Avengers had bound upon tho back of ■’ 0ie horse in the defile of the Iowa bluffs. He 5 recognized Old Shadow as the author of that f.bsrilous rido, and called tho attention of his fjriends to his arms and legs, where the thongs had bruised and cut the flesh.
A howl of vengeance burst from the crowd as he concluded his speech, for he was a warrior of no little distinction, and was regarded as the most staring and skillful horseman in the whole tribe.
; “ Lot Swift-Ridier say what shall be done | with the pale-faca villain,” said one of the hunt-
°^^et ^him be punished by the plan his owu
•	krain invented to torture me,” replied Swift-flider, glancing at the young buffalo struggling
'Inhis bonds.
A cry of approbation burst from every lip. Even tho voice of him who claimed the buffalo acquiesced in the punishment.
“Dod dnm yer red pictures!" Old Shadow exclaimed, indignantly, yer a pack o’ wranglin’, maw-mouthed dogs and cowardly coyotes I I can lick the hull caboodle o' ye and not ha’f
*r?Svo or three savages seized him and dragged fdm rudely toward the buffalo, at the same time uttering terrible threats, in which “ scalp-Jmife ” sounded the most ominous to the hun-
*• Wal," he said, “ who keors what ye do, ye blubber-heads. Ye needn’t make so much noise •bout a little thing as this."
A blow warned him to keep silent[ which he jnansgod to do, but it was more trying to him jfaan the idea of being bound upon the buffalo’s
He was dragged into the slough and thrown rudely across the animal’s back face upward, and his head resting near the beast’s shoulders.
His arms were drawn backward in a painful position aad firmly lashed with a strong lasso. His leg* ware bound in a similar manner; then ftrope was passed over his breast and around (he beast, thus doubly securing him.
After adding a few triumphant taunts and jeers to their cruel work, the rope* that held the young buffalo a captive were severed; then (he beast’s haunches and sides were pricked With the keen points of knives, and smarting with this Inhuman treatment, it struggled to its feet and plunged furiously forward with a bellow of pain and fear.
A few desperate lunges carried it from the «lou~h onto solid ground. Here, by mad cavorting and leaps it tried to dislodge its rider, but to vain.
A yell of savage triumph burst from the lips at tin red-skins, and filled the animal with •ffrlght The next instant it was thundering Kt’ a breakneck speed over the prairie, with its helploss human burden.
“By Heaven!” exclaimed the old hunter, “this is a leetle more than I keer about.' I’m -Afraid, Ole Shader, this’ll set ye up. But better tiiis way than in the hands of them varlete.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
A FEABFUL CHASE.
Fob a moment the Avepgers hesitated, filled with no little surprise and fear. That deep, thunderous noise rolled nearer and nearer, anu not until they had heard a savage yell did they discover it was a mighty herd of buffalo being pursued by dusky hunters.
“ It is buffalo, Doys,” said Ralph St. Ledger,” “ and I’m afraid we’re directly m their path."
“Ugh!'’ ejaculated the Omaha, ‘‘there are many buffaio coming, but they will pass us to the west. W e are in no danger. ”
This assertion was found to be correct. The vast herd swept close past them and on away into the darkness that hovered over the great pjain.
The prairie fire by this time was coming down rapidly on their left, and blinding volumes of smoke were settling over the plain. Mo time was to be lost, and so the Avengers swept sharply on.
An hour or more had passed, when suddenly a cry from Omaha’s lips brought the party to a stand. The Friendly pointed away to the right, where the foiut, phosphorescent glimmer of water could just lie seen.
The party at once headed toward it, and soon found themselves on the bonk of what is known in the language of the prairie as a buffolo-wol-loiv. It was a large circular spot, hulf an acre in extent, and sunk several feet below the level of the plam. At one time it had been full of wuter, but the hot suns mid dry winds had evaporated it until there was but a small pond left in the center of the Iiasin.
This wallow would afford them an admirable retreat from the prairie tire for themselves and animals, and bo they at once entered it and rode down as close to the water as possible.
Dismounting, they watered thoir wearied ponies, then picketed them within the “ wallow " by means prepared by their former owners.
They now ascended from the basin to its edgo to see what progress the prairie fire was making. It was still over a quarter of a mile away, but a slight breeze was rising and carrying it along quite rapidly.
Nothing could be seen of their late foes. All was silence and gloom save where the fire stretched its lurid length across the plain.
For several minutes the Avengers stood and gazed in silence upon the fire that came steadily on until it was less than a hundred yards from them. Then they turned to retrace their footsteps to the center of the basin, but, at this juncture, a sound broke forth on the stillness of the night.
They stopped and listened. To their cars came a human cry, mingled with the pounding of hoofs u]x>n tho plain.
; The Avengers seemed rooted to the spot. They listened with blank amazement stamped upon tlieir faces.
Again that human cry wailed out upon the night-air. The ponies in the wallow pricked up 1 their ears and sniffed the air with affright.
“ By Heaven! some one is perishing, in the flames!” exclaimed Fred Travis, excitedly.
" Hark! 1 hear hoof-strokes,” added St. Leger.
He had scarcely spoken, when, forth from the 1 darkness into the light of the burning prairie,
, rushed a fearful sight. It was a black, shaggy mass—a beast whose hoofed feet beat loudly upon the plain. It was a solitary buffalo. His eyes were glowing like coals of fire, his nostrils were dilated with terror, his tongue was lolling out, and white foam stood upon his flanks and was flying in flakes from his side. He was mad. He rushed between the Avengers and the fire.
; He was not over twenty paces from them.
They could see the terrible expression of his ’ eyes, and upon his back they saw a human form! They could see it was bound there, and
>	they could see the cords that held it. The light of the burning prairie flared across the upturned face. It was haggard and rendered gnastly in the glare of Cue flames, yet they recognized it. It was tho face of their dear friend, Old Shadow'
“To horse, boys!" cried Death-Notch; “it is Old Shadow! To the rescue!”
Not a word was added. Each man flew to his horse, and in a moment was mounted and in hot pursuit of the buffalo and its helpless rider.
Far over the plain, deep into tne labyrinths of darkness, pressed the Avengers, close upon the heels of the maddened buffalo.
The prairie fire was far behind. Only a red glow in the heavens could be seen; and only the moving shadow before them guided the Avengers in their pursuit.
It was a wild, fearful midnight chase.
CHAPTER XXXV.
THE JKDIAK VILLAGE.
It was daylight, and the morning sun shone from a cloudless sky. bathing the great plains of Nebraska in its golden radiance. A clump of cottonwoods on tue banks of the Platte river, which found its way across the plain with the sinuosity of a serpent, was the only object that broke the sameness of that prairie ocean. But, as the morning advanced, a little party of horsemen appeared	the plain from thev’ clump
of oottonwoods, and hooding toward the north-' weet, rode away at a slow pace.
They were white men, and ten in number. They were the Aveigers. In their midst was Old Shadow. He was well and unharmed, and. though somewhat bruised and sore, was os full of life and jollity as ever.
He had been rescued from the buffalo’s back by his friends, after a long and painful chase; and now he spoke of the adventure as ooe of tlw most perilous of his life on the prairie.
The )iarty was following the trail of the Indians, who it had every reason to believe held Sylveen and Vida captives.
Fred Travis and Death-Notch rode in tho ngr of the main body. They did not enter into <£• excitement of their adventures with the cams freedom as their companions.
The sweet, fair face of Vida—innocent an4 child-like in her purity of heart and mind— was over appealing to the heart of young Travjf in captivity and suffering. While to Death-Notch, fear, anxiety and suspense were twofold, because he had both Vida and Sylveen tt share his affections and love.
Not one of the Avengers, besides Fred and Omaha, ever mistrusted Ralph St. Leger of being Death-Notch. Fred haa kept the fact a secret from his friends by Ralph's request In the meantime he bad preserved a close watcb upon the youth’s movements. At times ho saw he acted n little strange, but Ralph seemed to be able to control that demon of madness that at times took entire possession of him.
“ I have great hopes,” said Death-Notch to Fred, as they journeyed on, “ that we will corns up with the main column of savages soon. At the further extremity of this prairie a rang* of wooded hills sots in, and in among them I believe the Indiana will pitch their lodges.”
“ In case they do." responded Fred, “ it will make our chances of rescuing our frionds all tha more difficult, will it notP’
“ True, Fred; but, when we find our friends are alive and captives, we will have time to calculate our chances of rescuing them. There will be some way to effect their release. If not by stratagem, perhaps we can make a charge inti, their comp, and then, if we fail,” and a smile played about Ralph’s lip*,' “perhaps Death-Notch will make his appearance and help us out.”
Fred almost shuddered, but managed to conceal his emotions from Ralph, and said:
“ Do you feel as if you were going to have oue of your attacks f”
Ralph laughed in a low, pleasant tone.
“ Mot in the least,” he said. “It is no mental debility, Fred, but just the result of an ungovernable passion—an exciting mind and revengeful spirit. You have no doubt seen men laboring under the same spells as I do at times. You have seen them become irritated, and let their passion run away with their judgment, and, while under these fits of madness, they will do things—even commit murder—for they have no control over their actions. This is my case exactly, though I can excite myself into ther* passions when I try. Yet ft takes no effort < t my own to make me mad with revenge, when I see before me one of those accursed savages tb*tt slew my friends.”
“ Your hatred of them must be very bitter, * said Francis.
“ It is, Fred; so much so that I would like to exterminate the whole Sioux race. But 1 must break myself of this vindictive spirit of revenge and ungovernable passion, or I will never be worthy of the love of Sylveen Gray. But, I never told you why I hate the Sioux so. A few years ago my father was a rich planter in the South, and had a happy, pleasant home. There were three children ot us, two girls and a boy We had received a very liberal education, wheii father took the ‘ northern fever,’ and ooncluded to try his fortune on the rich praires of the North-west He came up to look at the country, and made known his intention to the few white* he met in the territory. He was encouraged in his intentions by a young man. then a resident of the country, and not only did be extol the advantages of the land, but pointed out to father a beautiful location But father objected to this on the grounds of its being too near the Indians. To set aside all fears from this source, he took father to the head chief, from whom he received a promise of everlasting friendship. Father came north upon these assurances. He had a large amount of money and stock, which, of course, ho brought with him, but no sooner had we become located than the Indians, led by tho very white man Who had encouraged father's emigration West, attacked our home. Father was slain defending his family. Uother. sisters Olive and Vida and myself were taken capttvaa Olive was a young woman then, but Vida was a little girl. For a long, long time we were kepk prisoners, and during that time tongue can not express the hellish torture to which mother and Ohve were subjected. The meanest slaves ot tho South were never treated as they were. Day by day they were made to toil their life away,, and I was a witness of it all. Bui death finally ended their suffering, and, as I gazed dowc upun thoir cold, emaciated faces, expreesioaVcs ia death, then, Travis, I took that oath that mmie

me Death-Notch, and I believe Heaven justified my course. Hem-over, it was a long time before I escaped with Vida from the Indians’ stronghold, but when X did, I began mv work, and from then dates the working of Death-Notch, the young Seal p-Hun ter. In tho moan time I met Sylveen Gray and loved her. My love being relumed, we met often, though I never went to Stony Cliff. But, now, I feel as though I should give up the life I havebeen leading, not only for my own sake, but the sake of those who love me.”
“ Yours has been a hard fate, Ralph, as well i as singular,” replied Fred; “but I hope you will I hsWe no occasion to endanger your life again, and that fate has something tetter in the future for you tlian it has had in the past.”
“I hope so, too, Fred, but, whenever and wherever I meet that treacherous white villain that betrayed mv father to tho Indians, he shall die.”
“He deserves to. Ralph, if he has not met his just dues ere this.
“ No, he has not, unless it has been lately; but what is up now? I see Omaha has dismounted, and is examining the trail.”
The two rode up. They found the red scout was examining fee trail to ascertain how re- j oently it had been made.
“What dt> you make of it, Omaha?” asked i one.
“ It has been made since the dew was on the I grass,” replied Omaha.
“ Then we must be close on the heels o' the sneakin' varlets,” said Old Shadow; “so let’s I spur up, boys, and git along a leetle faster, for I want to git to liftin’ h’ar, so I do. ”
“Take it easy, Shadow,” said young Carter; “we’ll catch up with them soon enough.”
The party rode on until they struck the range •f the hill’spoken of by Ralph, about sunset. Here they encamped, and on the following morning scouts were thrown out.
They soon returned with the surprising information that Inkpaducah and his tribes had pitched their lodges In a deep valley, about two miles away. Tim decided tne future course of the Avengers, and thev at once moved to a place of concealment, covering their trail as best they could. Remaining hidden until darkness again set in, the whole party then set off toward the Indian village, guided by Omaha.
From a commanding point they were enabled to tee into the new town, that was lighted up with numerous glowing camp-fires.
The location was a good one, affording many natural defenses. A high escarpment of ruggel hills encircled it on three sides, cutting off approach from these point*.
OH the fourth side the river guarded the approach to the valley, yet there were narrow passages between the river and hills, giving access to the valley. But these pasBagee the wily old chief had doubly guarded, and he rested under the self-assurance that he had at last found a retreat in which he need have no fears of an enemy, however strong.
The almost impregnable situation of the village Impressed ltnefl upon the mind* of the Avengers, and filled them with a feeling akin to despair.
Hundreds of camp-fires showed them the interior of the camp. Warriors were stalking about as if to familiarize themselves with their new village; children played in groups here and there, while tho squaws—the slaves of the great warriors—were busy with their usual drudgery.
The Avengers strained their eyes for a sight of their captive friends. They saw nothing but a few white men, and these they knew were renegades, for they enjoyed all the liberties of the camp.
“I see no captives, nor chance for us, boys,r (aid Amos Meredith'.
“There must be a chance for us,” replied Ralph St. Leger; “ we must make a chance, if our friends we find are prisoners in that encampment. If they are, we must release them at aH hazards; but if they are not. ami have been tlato^I shudder to think what will follow at my
“ And ours, too,” said several of the Avengers.
The little hand continued its reconnoissance for Some time, then they returned to the place where they had left their horses. Here they went the remainder of the night and on the following morning began a detour around the village to find an entrance to the valley.
CHAPTER XXX VL THE PHANTOM HOR8EMKN.
Old Inkpaduoah was at last safe with his tribe, to he thought He had long before heard of the natural advantages of this valley for an encampment, and growing uneasy under the punishments that threatened him in the Territory of Iowa, he had taken up his line of march for this valley, which he found equaled in every respect the reports ha had heard of it.
Through the center of the village a little streamfonnd its way, while along the base of the hills was a belt of shrubbery and rich, succulent grass that furnished good psaturage for so they had o^gjre game
31m escarpment of the hfllJMgMWy sur-
rounded the village ran high above the tops of the forest trees and was outlined against the sky like the summit of some grim old battlement. A bird oould not move athwart its summit without being seen by those in the valley below.
On the second night after their entrance to the valley, the head men of the tribe were assembled in council near the center of the town. They had met simply for congratulation—to rejoice and talk over their new and impregnable defense, and the glory that seemed opening to the tribe, in their escape from their hated enemies and from the terrible Death-Notch.
Foremost in the council was Le Subtile Fox, who, as the reader has no doubt already inferred, was Pirate Paul, though he went disguised. His words still seemed to have great weight in their council, and he was now listened to as one possessed of the powers of prophecy; for once he had told them that the day would soon come when they would be forever free from tho persecutions of their enemies in a beautiful valley far away, and although they now believed they were in that valley, Le Subtile Fox had reference in his prophecy to the valley of Death, where their enemies seemed fast hurrying them.
“ When docs the white chief return to the villa(re of the pal e-faces'” asked Inkpaducah of the pirate.
“ I shall go soon,” replied Le Subtile Fox.
“ And what will you do with the white squaw that calls you hnFltandr’
“Leave her in your care.” replied the villain.
The chief was about to reply, when a low exclamation without the tent arrested their attention.
They arose from their seats and hurried out the lodge. The moon was up and shining bright.
,fWhat is the cause of this commotion?" Pirate Paul asked of the sentinel on guard at the door of the council-lodge
“Look there!” replied the sentinel, pointing away toward the summit of the escarpment to the northward of the town.
Every eye was turned in the direction indicated, and along the crest of the hills that were outlined against the clear, starry sky, they beheld a single horseman riding at "a wild, furious speed. They could bear the clear, sharp ring of each hoof-stroke upon tho stony path. They could see the flashing of a spear-head in the moonlight. They could see the horseman’s tall plumes nodding about his head and naked shoulders, and from these they knew he was a friend.
The watchers in the valley permitted their eyes to follow him along the ridge until it dipped down below the dark horizon.
Then they awaited his coming. He came soon. He was terribly excited, and his beast was white with foam and in the last stages of exhaustion.
“ Why, Ahlah, ride so fast?" asked Le Subtile Fox, as he drew rein near the council-lodge.
“ Ahlah,” replied the Indian, “ has seen terrible things. The village of the Sioux is in the valley of the Hobbamocko. Look yonder 1”
The savages looked in the direction indicated, and saw a number of horsemen appear in sight. They were riding, or. as it seemed, floating along the summit of the escarpment.
The savages stood awe-stricken, terrified. There was something unearthly in the amiear-ance of these horsemen. The hoof-strokes of their animals gave forth no sound, while both horse and rider seemed like beings of giant proportions—liko Titan phantoms galloping through the air. Had their horses’ hoofs produced the least sound, they might have believed they were of earth; but the absence of sound, when they had heard the hoof-strokes of their friend’s horse so sharply, and the colossal proportions of both man ana beast, were enough to fill every heart with misgivings.
The savages watched the strange apparitions gallop along the hights in silence; then, as they dropped from view against the dark horizon, thore followed a silence equal to that of death. But it was soon broken by a low cry tbat wailed out, striking every heart with terror. The sound came from the north side of the town, and as the terrors of the moment subsided—when the last of the phantom-giants had faded into darkness—other sounds were heard issuing from the 6ame side of the village, and soon a low cry was raised that ran from mouth to mouth, and the name Death-Notch quivered in accents of terror on every lip I
Then came a runner to the cotmeil-lodge with tho startling newBthat Death-Notch had been in the village and had slain a warrior.
The chiefs shuddered with terror, and Le Subtile Fox grew uneasy with a strange fear. Their supposed security and freedom from that terrible young Scalp Hunter was, after all, a vain hope, ana he was still haunting their trail.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
A PIPE OF PEACE.
Back in tho woods some two miles from the Indian village, was a large tree whose branching
boughs and pandent creepers gave It more thsifl appearance of a huge banyan than an oak. « Numerous parasites, such as the wild grape-*] vine, wild cucumber, and wild ivy, had scram-1 bled up the trunk of the tree, and creeping otrti upon the branches to their extremities had clihed downward to the earth again, thus forai-i ing a curtain of green foliage around the trc>>,! and an incloeure of several yards in diameter. This incloeure presented the interior appearance of a huge pavilion, the tree-tnmk represen tin ft the central pole.	nfi
Within the walls of this natural inclosure wer«; grouped seven persons. They sat before a smti I fire whose light revealed their faceeand the ei > pressions of anxiety upon them. It was a pai»! of our friends, the Avengers.	>i
Two of the band stood on guard outside o.'i their retreat: these were Omaha and Old Sho s dow. In th* background stood nine horse r bridled and saddled, and their dripping flank t told that they had been ridden hard and fast, and that quite recently. Their hoofs wen muffled in pieces of woolen blankets, that wen wrapped around and under the hoofs, and confined at the pestern.
All the Avengers were present except RalpK St. Leger, and for him they now waited. He had gone to the village of the Sioux to make a reconnoissance, and learn, if possible, whether Vida and Sylveen were held captives there.
The night was far advanced when he returned. His face, as he appeared before his companions, wore an expression of sadness and disappointment which Fred Travis readily interpreted to himsolf.
“You are back safe, young friend,” said. Amos Meredith, as Ralph made his appearaac* under the oak.
“ I believe so,” replied St. Leger, with a smile.
“ Did you succeed in getting into the Indian village?’ asked another.
“ Yes; I spent all of half an hour wandering about in the place without detection.”
“ Doggoned wonder ye didn’t git yerself set up, with a dig in the ribs,” remarked Old Shadow.
“ I would not have stood much chance had the Indians not been so busy watching the phantom horsemen. ”
“ Phantom horsemen? What do you mean?” “The horsemen th»t galloped with mufflad hoofs along the ridge.”
“You allude to us?”
“Yes. The savages saw you riding along the i rockj- highte and became terror-stricken. Isair : you myself, and 1 must admit you presented a wonderful appearance. Outlined against tJie sky, you seemed magnified into beings ten-foH your size, and as the muffled hoofs of you* horses produced no Bound, you appeared bfc* giant phantoms in the air; and it was a fortunate occurrence for me, for I was getting irrt pretty close quarters about that time.”
A low, silent laugh followed Ralph's story. The Avengers had ridden along the ridge in it? derto reach the point where they now w«m They had muffled their animals' feet that tbs Bounds of their hoofs would not bo heard, nevrtj once dreaming of being brought out so prowi nent against the sky to the savages’ eyes.
“ Well," said Fred Travis, burning with im patience to hear from his darling Vida, “ whs* discovery did you make# Are they—the girls -there f"
Ralph bit his lips, as if to keep back some toward emotion. For a moment he was silept, then he replied:
“ No, they are not there.”
The features of young Travis became eloudod with disappointment, and for a Moment a deathlike silence pervaded the place.
Death-Noteh was the first to speak.
“No; Vida and Sylvoen are not there. But there are other white female captives there, and among them is a young woman whom I havs spen at Stony Cliff, and whom Sylveen called Martha Gregory. The others are ao doubt captives taken at the Spirit Lake Massacre, and of whom you and your friends are in search.”
“No doubt or itl no doubt of it!” exclaimed several of the Avengers, and the muttered words of sister, mother, or friend, might hav* been heard spoken in whispered accents.
The youths were free in expressing hopes of tho speedy release of their friends. But how were they to do it? This was the question that passed from Up to lip without an answer.
Thera was not a doubt in the minds of Death-Natch and Fred but tbat Vida and Sylveen had been slain. If not, where were they? There, was nothing that admitted of a hope of their having escaped from their captors, and a new spirit of vengeance seemed to have fired th# hearts of both the youths. Still they did not give way to despair entirely. They thought the maidens might possibly have been hidden awsy somewhere, or that Ralph hod mimed them in the village; and, after some deliberation as to their future course, they came to a conclusion that was likely, if successful, to give them soma information. It was to release Martha Gregory and learn from her whether Sylveen and Vida had been taken captives by Inkpaducah’s war-riora; if so. sho could give some clew to tixeiy absence.

The I Avengers had just reached this plain, and were about debouching from tho forest into it, when k they made a discovery that caused them to Earaw rein instantly. Over two hundred In-. dian warriors were encamped on the edge of the Jprairie, not over thirty rods from them. k A single glanoe told our friends it was a war-[aarty. Their horses wore picketed near by, find their spears were aligned in a circle about j.ihoir camp.
£ ■ Tho hour was stiU that of early mom, and it ^•ras evident from their movements that the savages were preparing to move.

. Tn j Avengers fanained under cover of the . vtKi.ii, watching m breathless anxiety the result of Omaha’s conference.
Tho friendly rode into their camp, and was ,oon surrounded by the warriors. A short confutation ensued, when a shout from the lips of the savages pealed out on the air. It was a welcome shout, and our friends know Omaha had fceei. received aaa friend.
A momont later Omaha wheeled his horse, and . riding back to where his companions awaited him. said:
r “Let my white friends have no fear of the | warriors yonder. They are our friends and the enemies of the Sioux, and are marching upon ■their village. They will hoip the Avengers to rescue their friends.”
k Tha whites would have doubted the motives of th« warriors had it been reported to them by »ny oi:ier than Omaha. But the friendly was a ' tried friend, and they knew that no subtle cunning or treachery of the red-skins could circumvent liim, and, with a shout of joy and thankfulness for such timely friendship, the little band rode from the woods and approached the red-skins’ camp with open hands, significant ■dpence

The Avengers dismounted. Then the pi|>e of 'pence was brought out and smoked, and peace tnd friendship between the two parties were 1 AstablLslied.
A conference was now held, Omaha repro-tenting onr friends and tho leader of the sav-»ges tho tliree tribes under his command. The .tescuo of their friends by the one party, and Vengeance by the other, were tho motives that had brought them there, yet they pledged them-•elvea to w'ork together.
When the conference broke up it was with the understanding that they were to attack the Btoux village the coming night; and that the position of the enemy’s camp, and tho passage loading into the valley, might be thoroughly tmderstood, a scout from each party was sent 'Sot to make a recoimoissance of the topography ft the valley	_
CHAPTER XXXVIH.
THE ATTACK.
Night again fell over (he land. The moon "■•as not vet up, for it wds early. Camp-fires dotted, libs twinkling stars, tho dark valley in ’Which was located the village of Inkpaducah. Tall, dusky figures went stalking about the wrapped in blankets and robes. Others | reelinod in (croups about the fires, smoking and , ^talking. They did not feel entirely secure i there in that valley, which seemed to Have been j 'created for their especial favor. They had not j .. forgotten the phantom horsemen of the night j previous, nor that Death-Notch had been in ! •heir camp and slain a warrior.
Double guards had been posted around the valley, and every point of approach made, as thay believed, impregnable.
As the hours wore on, a number of the war- j Tier* sought their couches, while others sat I •boot the waning camp-fires and talked and MQg, In a wild, riotous manner.
SMddenly they were startled br a sound. I* I
was tlie sooiul ol a oilman voice, and n was a white man’s voice. It was within the v alley, and was approaching their camp. How an enemy could have gained admission to their stronghold unseen, was a mystery to the savages.
They bent their ears and listened. The voice was coming nearer, and they could hear that it was singing a sprightly air. There were whites among the savages, who had heard that voice before, and recognised the words he was singing. They ran thus:
“ The 'possum he grinned at the ole hedgehog.
At the ole hedgehog, the ole hedgehog:
The 'possum he grinned at the ole hedgehog.
'Way down by the Squantum river."
Then from the gloom beyond the radios of the camp- ilros issued a long, cadaverous-look-ing white man, whose rapid strides soon carried him into the midst of the astonished redskins.
" Hullo, my beauties!” exclaimed the bold intruder. with apparent indifference; "howgoes it, ©nnvhow? Dull times out here in Nebraska, ain't it? Skulps and whisky are purty skeerse, I trow, eh, lovelies C The savages sprung to their feet and flocked around the daring pale-face, giving vent to various exclamations of curiosity and mistrust.
" Stand a leetle back, here, idiots.” yelled the old hunter, as they gathered too close about him to feel at ease; ‘1 did ye ever see a white gentleman afore? I’m not a seahoss, nor a Bengolly tiger, but I'm Old Shader, Esquire, and I'll flit across yer vision, fust thing ye know, ve gapin’ knaves. ”
"Ugh!” ejaculated an Indian; “ole rattle-tongue—heap talk—no sense."
"Be cautious, red-skin, how ye handle yer words, or I’ll spot ve. I'm here on bisness, and
1	don't want to idle words with you common herd. Trot out yer ole chi<^„ as I wish to give him a bit o’ advice.”
"Waugh! tho chief is here’’ said Inkpaducah, pushing his way through the circle of savages and confronting the old hunter with a haughty scowl. "Let the pale-face say what he has to say.”
"Whew! A littlo crusty!’’ ejaculated the hunter, softly; "but then, ole hoss. I’m here on bisness. I hear you have got some white captives here: some you took at Spirit Lake, and some at othor places. ”
" What is that to the pale-face?" demanded the chief.
" I want ’em, and now if ye’ll jist trot ’em out and let us leave in harm’ny, why. I’ll say no more ’bout it, and ye’ll save ye’re ole hide o gitr tin' a hole punched through it. mebbv. "
A contemptueus smile swopt over the face of the chief, and there was a vindictive gleam in every savage eye.
“ The pale-face is a fool,” returned tho chief, " to think that Inkpaducah will accede to his demands. Not even the pale-face hunter shall ever leave our village alive.”
'' Bah! Git out; ye’re laborin' under an orful mistake. Unless ye release the hull kit o' prisoners in yer hands, be they red or be they white, anti that within ten minutes, yoilr village will run red with blood, and scalps will fly like snow-ttakes. now mind ye.”
" The pale-faco speaks as though he was a host. ”
•• I am a tough ole coon, Inky, and can whal-lop, at least, half a dozen sich ole rats as you are, but then, my ole dear. I’ve over two hundred friends waitin', this blessed minit, to open flre on your little burg.”
“ The pal e-face’s tongue is crooked; he lies.”
•• That's it!” ejaculated the hunter. “ I allers hev tho luck o’ gittin' called a crooked-tongue. in spite o' my great regard fur the trootn; but then, I never have swallered tho lie, nor, be cussed, if I imUP'
As the last two words fell from the old hunter’s lips, his fist was planted fair between the chief’s eyes. The red-skin fell to the earth as though he had been shot, while a cry of triumph, that was almost deafening, pealed from the old hunter's lips.
Then, from out the darkness along the base of the hills, within the village, arose another yell, that was mingled with the crash of fire-arms and the flutter of over two hundred pairs of feet, as thov came swarming into the village.
Old Shadow’s words had proven true. The enemies of the Sioux, the Omahas, the Sacs, tho Foxes, and the Spirit Lake Avengers, were upon them.
Tho Sioux were taken completely bv surprise, but they soon recovered from tho first shock, and gave battle, and then began a terrible struggle in tho very heart of the village.
The eight avengers stood together^ and, side by side, fought their way to the pnson-lodge. Here ensued a sanguinary struggle, but tho whites and their red friends were victorious, and succeeded in forcing their way into the
iffey found several captives therein, one of whom was Martha Gregory. The others were all young women, and the affecting ..cene that followed the entrance of the Avengers into tho lodge, told that their coming had not been in vain, for them most of them found a captive
fr: .n i. However, t’.iere ■wore but a few short momenta in which to exchange words of lore and greeting; but, in the meantime, Death-Notch learned from the lips of Martha Gregory that Vida and Sylveen had not been captives there at all—that they were not in the village.
With t^ushed hopes and bleeding heart, Ralph bade his companions follow him with their friends, and they at once began their retreat from the village. The allied savage forces were gradually pressing the Sioux back toward the eastern side of the town, therefore our whit* friends had but little difficulty in gaining the cover of the forest on the western side of the place, making their exit from the valley through a narrow defllo which the Sioox guards had deserted to join in battle.
Here those of the Avengers that had found friends, were enabled to obtain a few minutes’ talk with each other.
" And you are sure, Miss Gregory,” said Fled Travis, “that Sylveen Gray has not been in this villager “ I am certain of it,” replied Martha; “ the last I saw of Sylveen was on the night I was captured.”
Fred groaned in spirit, and turning to Deatb-Notch, said:
“ Ralph, I am afraid 8ylveea and Vida have been slain.”
Ralph made no reply, but the silence that followed told that he was terribly agitated, and for a moment Fred was afraid he could not restrain his emotions.
The conflict lasted several momente in the village. The Sioux, however, were finally driven from their stronghold and compelled to seek refuge amonp the rocks and undergrowth at the base of the nills on the east side of the village, where the women and children had already gone.
The allied victors now fired the wigwams, and with a number of horses, several prisoners and some plunder, they began their retreat from the valley, guided by the light of the burning town.
The victory had been a decisive one, and forever broke the power of Inkpaducah. And the allied tribes felt that their disaster of a few mouths previous had beeh nobly avenged, and with their prisoners and plunder, at once set off on their homeward journey.
The night of the battle, however, the eight Avengers camped in the forest with their red friends, and on the following morning they separated, each party taking its own course.
The Avengers turned their footsteps toward Stony Cliff, mo6t of them feeling happy over the rescue of their friends. Fred Travis and Ralph St. Leger, however, were sad at heart They feared, and in fact every thing went to confirm their fears, that the objects of their hearts had been slain; yet they entertained a faint hope that the girls might have escaped and returned to Stony Cliff. If not, they must have perished in the woods.
At noon tho party made a few minutes’halt. Travis and St Leger stood aside talking about Sylveen and Vida, for they were never out of their minds a minute, and the agony of fear and suspense was growing upon them. They became reatless in spirit and mind. Their conversation was finally interrupted by the approach of Martha Gregory, who asked a moment s conversation with them. It being readily granted, she asked:
“ When did you last see Sylveen and Vida, Mr. St. Legerr Ralph told her. and on learning that they had been together after her—Martha’s—capture, a suspicion entered her mind in an instant.
Then,” she said. “ if your cabin was attacked on the night of their disappearance, i am satisfied the Indians never took them. I have a suspicion of where they are, if alive.”
“Where? where!” exclaimed the youths.
" In tho den of Pirate Paul!”
A cry of bitter agony burst from their lips. They would much rather have known the girls were captives in the power of the Indians than in power of the robbers.
‘‘Then they are lo6t!” exclaimed young Travis, “for/the den of Pirate Paul, you know, has baffled all our attempts to find it St Leger. this is awful, torturing, agonizing. What shall we do?”
“Search for them, Travis—search, until w* are gray.”
“You need have no uneasinet®, youngmen, in regard to the whereabouts of Pirate Paul’s den. . Within an hour after we reach Stony Cliff. I will lead you iyito his den/”
“You are jesting, surely jesting. Miss Gregory!” exclaimed Fred, half-hopefully.
“ I am not I have been within {he robber’s den. I have kopt its location a secret for reasons of my own. But, I shall do so no longer.”
“ Then there is some hopes of saving them yet,” said St Leger, “if poor little Vida haa not fretted her life away.”
“ God grant that they are both alive and unharmed, Ralph I But, let us not torTy here too long. Every moment may be of great importance.”	*i Hie next minute, almost, they were mounted and moving at a rapid pace over til* l£nnf green ocean ot prairie.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
•mr bobbers’ bidden rahche is fouwd. Tbb retreat of Inkpaducah and his warriors tram the valley of the Sioux, gave the settle™ of Stony Cliff some assurance of future peace; not only from the savagoa, but also from the robbers, who would now have no immediate •ource of protection when closely pressed, nor eucoor in time of need—when a large settlement or ediigrant train was to be plundered.
The greatest sorrow, however, had fallen upon the settlement in consequenoe of the mysterious disappearance of Sylveen Gray and Martha Gregory.
The settlers had not a doubt but that the girls had been captured and carried away by the Indians, but every attempt toward rescuing them had proved - unavailing. At last Scott Shirely and several of his hunter employees in the fur business volunteered to go in search of them. They ??ent. and, after several days’ absence, returned without any tidings of the missing maid-•113. But bad the honest-hearted bottlers once inspected that Scott Shirely was Pirate Paul, and that his employees were his followers, they Would have also suspected them of spiriting the maidens away, instead of returning them. But they never dreamed that such an apparent gentleman as Soott Shirely could be guilty of such wickedness, for he had worked his ropes so cun-kingly and quietly that there was no opening (or any suspicion.
Elated over their success in thus deceiving the settlers, Shirely and his men grew less fearful ot their den being discovered.
On the night following that of Pirate Paul’s departure from the Indian village, the robbers were in their den, drinking freely and talking over their late adventures. But there wore several vacant chain in the ranche. Death had been in the ranjss of the freebooters since we last saw them in council in their stronghold.
They wore no masks, for they no longer entertained fears of any one happening into their ranche. and recognizing them before they could make their escape.
“ Well,” said Pirate Paul, “our four friends that were slain during our expedition were good boys, and I feel the loss of them greatly. But. then, we have made the settlers believe that they fell in the search for the girls, and so, after all, we have gained something by their death. It is a good thing, too, that we got rid of that Martha Gregory, or she would have bio wed us higher than Gilderoy’s kite.”
“ Who was she, anyhow, Cap!” asked one of his men.
11	Well, she thinks she is my wife. I got an old humbug of a preacher to go through the <*remony when I was over in Canada. The little fool thought it was all right, but when I got/ tired of her, I dropped her into the St. Lawrence river, and supposed I was entirely rid of her, ■nd, as her husband, that I would inherit the last little fortune to which I knew she was heir. But, the old saying of a bad penny returning, has been verified in my case. However, I think she is safe now where she will give me no further trouble. It appears that El Pardou, the chap we came Death-Notch on, was a cousin of here, and a spy upon our track.”
“ Good thing we hung the traitor when we did,” said Griff Morton.
“ Yes; and the settlers bolieve to this day that Vtath-Notch slew him,” said Finchly, the spy.
‘ Well, let's try and keep them thinJrin’so; but wouldn’t I give a land title in Jerusalem to know tho Death-Notch is,” said another.
“ You may know, to vour sorrow, soon enough. Bid fellow,” laughed Pirate Paul; “ but I am •atisfied as to who Death-Notch is. In the first place, he is the son of that rich fellow that came Irom the south about two or three years ago, Ind whom I succeeded in getting into the elutches of old Inkpaducah. You know, after I rot him into the country, I took a number of Indians and captured the whole family. The *ld man we killed, but the mother, two daughters and a son we carried captives to the village, the mother and her oldest daughter tho Indians worked to death, and the youngest girl and the ion they adopted. But after awhile they escaped, ana that bov I believe is Death-Notch, and the lord of the little hut where we first saw that dark-eyed girl that played on the guitar. They have grown older and changed considerable since I last saw them, but then I know they are tb>> children of that Southerner, Homer St. l*^er. I suppose the boy has determined to wreak vengeance on those that spoilt their fun >i the north, but—”
“ He seems to be doing it, to*,” interrupted *ne of the robbers.
“ Yes; I reckon, however, he has forgotten the face of Le Subtile Fox, for I was disguised then.. I wish now I had the ring I took from his mother, and gave to that young baby-face, Martha Gregory, as sho calls fiorseli1. It was a Very costly ring, and would look very nice on fits snowy fltiger of her daughter whoni I pro pose to wed."
“Hist!” suddenly exclaimed one of the robbers; “I was sure 1 heard a footstep.”
“■Fancy, fancy, Finchly,” said Pirate Paul;
a footstep r
"Then search the cavern,” replied the cap-tain.
Finchly arose to obey, and while he Is engaged in his search, let us change the aoene for a lew minutes to another point.
CHAPTER XL
WITHIN THE BOBBERS’ DEN.
On the same night that the robbers were in their den in consultation, a party of nearly twenty persons went into camp on the banks of the Sioux river, about five miles above Stony Cliff.
It was the eight Avengers and the friends they had rescued from the Indians. They could easily have reached the settlement that night by a little after dark, but they had no desire to do so. They had a mission to perform under cover of that night—before it became known in the village that Martha Gregory was safe.
Their horses being secured, and two of the Avengers left to take care of the females, the rest or the men, guided by Marti m tiregory, set off down the river toward Stony Cliff.
They traveled on in Bilence. and when the village appeared in sight on the bluffs outlined against the southern sky they came to a halt.
A scout was now sent forward to make some reconnoissance, and in the course of half an hour he returned.
“ How is it, Omaha—all quiet?”
“ Yes, the settlers are asleep. No one is abroad."
“ Tben we may as well continue our journey,” said Miss Gregory.
And so they moved on. and soon entered a narrow foot-path that wound along the river bank at the base of the bluffs. It was a difficult path to follow ip tho ilark, but, by carefully picking their footsteps, they finally found themselves opposite the village, and in the pathway leading up the acclivity from the river to the cabins.
•• Now which way. Miss Gregory?” asked Death-Notch.
•’ A few steps further on.” was the woman’s response; ‘ * but we can not reach the place on account of that projecting ledge. But there are two canoes that we can use. ”
The canoee were unfastened and the little party at once entered thorn They then turned down the stream, and running around a projecting point of the bank, turned in shore again and landed.
Martha again took the lead, and with the assistance of the vines and bushes that grew from the face of the cliff, the party began ascending the acclivity. Up at>out fifty feet from the water’s edge'they came to a halt on a narrow table-rock.
Long parasites and moss hung like a curtain down the face of the cliff above them. Martha Gregory parted this curtain at a certain point and said;
“ There, gentlemen, is one of the entrances la the den of Pirate Paul.”
" By Heaven I” exclaimed Travis, in an under tone, "then it is directly under Stonv Cliff!”
“ Yes,” replied Martha, “ and the’ main en trance—the one at which the robbers usually enter—is in the very heart of the village. It it under the large building occupied by the fur company. A trap-door in the cabin opens into that passage!”
“ This beats me!” said St. Leger; “ it is strange the settlers never found it out. But 1 feel satisfied now the girls are in this den.”
“ We will soon know. Follow me,” said Martha Gregory.
“ Are you sure you understand the place?” “Perfectly. My friend, El Pardou, showed me all through the place once when the robbers were away.
“ Then lead tho way, and we will follow.” Martha glided into the dark opening, closely followed by the Avengers.
In her hand the guide carried a piece of fungus or decayed wood—known in border lore as fox-fire—whose dull glow enabled her companions to follow on without difficulty.
CHAPTER XLI. the conflict in the cavern.
The robbers sat motionless and silent, waiting the return of the man sent to search the cavern.- Fear had suddenly taken possession of them all. There was something strangely foreboding of danger in the very atmosphere around them. But they breathed easier when they saw their scout returning, and had beaM him report “ all right”
•“ Only fancy—weak nerves,” said Pirate Paul, : though ne had been as deeply imbued with fear i as any of his men.
“ No,” Finchly still persisted, “ I would have sworn that I heard a footstep—ah I there it is i again 1 There is some one in this cavern besides ourselves!”
•True enough, all heard the footstep this time. | There was no fancy about it They turned , their eyes in the direction from whence the 1 sound emanated, and saw a human form emerge from the darkness. It was the form of a woman. A shawl was thrown hoodlike over her , bead, but, as she advanced, this was permitted to drop to ker shoulders, and the face and form
of Martha Gregory stood before the -..-shedi robbers.
“ Woman or devil, whichever you be, is HR possible yon are herer exclaimed Pirate Pool* “ It is possible, my truant Pirate Paul NorUt it the first time that 1 have been within your den.B'i “ But, by heavens, It shall be the last time ft roared the indignant robber chief; “you hav»S dogged mv footstep* long enough. You ahnljj not leave this ranche alive. I will link a knifW into your heart, instead of sinking you in tfe* St. Lawrence. ”
“You threaten me, base, cowardly wretcln You tried to murder me once, villain, and—*.;
“ Yes, and I will not be a fool again. I wil): do my work better this, tune. Men, seize bor V. The robbers started toward her.
“ Back, cowards!” she fairly hissed, and therf ■ was something bo terrible in the look she Sashed' upon them, that caused them to recoil.
“Seise her, seize her, I say!” yelled Piraf* Paul; •' do not let her escape.
But the men still refused to obey his coin*' mands. The robber chief grew wild with indignation and fury, and drawing a pistol, h*> leveled it at Martha’s breast. But he never had time to pull the trigger. The combined report of eight rifles rolled in awful reverberations through the chambers of the cavern, and Pirate Paul fell dead, as did also three or four of his' men. Then, from the darkness of the cavern rushed the Avengers with a yell that drove terror to the hearts of the surviving robbers, who, like hunted beasts, fled hither and thither through tho cavern, pursued by the Avengers.
The crack of pistols, the groans and sbneks of the dying and the triumphant shouts of the vio-, tors rolled in deafening intonations fromd chan* • ber to chamber of the great Kubtorraneanvault. > But the conflict lasted for only a few minutes. The robbers were all slain or driven from th* cavern, terror-stricken. When the conflict had ended, the Avengers gathered around the robbers’ card-table, whereon burned a lamp.
“ What next, boys?” asked Amos Meredith, elated with victory!
“ Let us search for Vida St Leger and Syl* veen Gray,’ replied Fred Travis. Miss Gregory. where is that prison-room you spoke off Lead us to it”
Martha took up the light and bade the Avengers follow. As she moved away, she passed the lifeless body of him whom she had onoe tailed husband. He lay u;>on his back, his face upturned. She paused, glanced at it, and then, as a aizh, that almost deepened into a sob, issued from her lips, she moved on.
After traversing several chambers of the cav era. their further progress was suddenly dis . puted by a heavy wooden door.
A cry of joy burst from the lips of Ralph 8t. Leger.
“That must be the door of their prison.’' h» said.
“ It is the door of the prison.” added Martha. Ralph beat upon the heavy door with his fist and called in frantic tones the name of his sista.
A voice was heard within. It was Vida> voice. She had recognized the tones of her half distracted brother.
“ Sister—Vida, is it you?” hecri<*d.
“ Ye6, we are here, brother—Sylveen and L“ “ Oh, it is Ralph I” the lover heard Sylveen ec claim.
“ Lend a helping band, friends," cried Ralph} “ let us burst down the door!”
There was something unearthly in the youth’} eyes. Fred Travis saw it and fcnew that that demon of madness was seizing upon him. BuU they all pressed upon the door.
It yielded, and burst inward.
There, in a brilliantly-lighted and well-fur* nished room, were Vida and Sylveen. Like cap* tive birds fluttering forth from their prison-cag* into the air, so the maidens nished from their prison-room to meet Ralph and Fred.
The angelic faces of tne maidens stayed the storm that was rising within the breast of Death-Notch. His heart was overcome with the emotions of joy, and he clasped his sister and sweetheart alternately to his breast.
From the lips of the maidens the Avenger* soon learned how they came to be there, in th» robbers’ den. After tueir capture at the cabin, the Indians turned them over to the robbers, who brought them there under cover of night “ And I must say for the robbers,” added SyV veen, “ that, although we have been held cap tives, we have been treated kindly and with re spect, but how long this would have lasted I know not”
“Not much longer,” said Martha Gregory “for Pirate Paul has been away from here sine* your capture, until to-night”
“ Then, thank God, our arrival Is opportune!? said young Travis.
Sylveen and Martha greeted each other with the fondness of sisters, and, after greetings had been exchanged all around, Martha took th* lamp, und said;
“ Now follow me. my dear friends, and I will conduot you from this fearful place.”
She did not go the way they had entered, but followed a passage leading in an entirely oppo'i: tiite direction, and soon cmne to a flight of BCOQfo step*. Up these step* she led the way, bat »

‘“Throe ye are, ’Squire Travis: and rijjht here we stood when wo heard, for the iirst time, the cry of one ave Death-Notch’s victims,” says Phelii O’Ray.
“ What changes time has brought to us all,” replies Travis; •• it scemB impossible that, after three years of constant dangers almost, we are all jxjrmitted to moet here together again. It
The sentence was broken abruptly off by the crack of a rifle ringing suddenly and sharply through the woods.
The young hunters gazed inquiringly from one to file other. It brought up recollections of the morning when they stool on that, very spot and heard the report of Deatb-Notch’s rifle and the wail of his victim echo through the woods.
“ Ah, there is some one besides ourselves in these woods," said Amos Meredith: “I hope Death-Notch has not turned out again."
“ It must be some hunter,” said Dick Carter. He had scarcely uttered the words when there suddenly broke upon their ears the voice of 6ome one singing, 111 a lively air, the words:
" The 'possum lie grinned at the ole hedgehog.
At the ole hedgehog, the ole hedcehog;
The 'possum he grinned (it the ole hedgehog.
’Way down by the Squantiim—**
“ Old Shadow as I live!” burst in j<n-ous accents from Fred Travis’ lips, as the old hunter emerged from the woods before them.
“Bless my ole eyes!” the hunter exclaimed, regarding our friends with surprise: “who’d a-thoughl it? Here I find ye, lads, after three years’ separashun.”
“Yes, yes; here we are, Shadow! Give us yoor hand, old friend, and tell us where you've l>een and how time uses you.”
“ Oh, I’ve been rompin’ around aver this little patch -o' yarth, doin’ a leetle huntin', scalpin’, and sich like.

"Glad, very glad, to see you. Shadow. You must go to the settlement with us. The womenfolks will bo very happy to see you. too." said Travis.
Wal, HI go down and see how yer gitting alonjj:; but whar’s the lad ye call D^ath-
“ We left him at Fairview to look after things while we were absent. But let us be off.”
The party hastened to where their horses were bridled and packed all ready for starting, and Omaha having resigned his animal to the old hunter, they set off for home.
It was nearly sunset when they hove in sight of a number of neat-looking log cabins nestled down in a little valley that was teeming with industry and enterprise.
“Whew!” ejaculated Old Shadow, “what’s that*
“Fairview,” replied Fred.
“The deuce! whew, but ye’ve got a leetle Paradise o’ yer own. Jist look at the oorn-fl’lds and the herds o’stock! Who’d V dreamp it ten years ago? Ah, me! this tells me that time is hoofin’ it on, and life with me is drawing to a close."
“ So it is with all of us, old friend, and you may live many long, happy years yet,” said Fred.
“Yes, yes, Travis,” replied the old hunter; “ butls’poso ye fellers are all married, ain’t ye?” “ All but Omaha. Phrilx O’Ray and David Hawes. You see that cabin to the right of the group? That is where Amos Meredith lives with his wife. The one next to it is where Ralph St. Leger lives with his wife and baby."

$Thepartrymiw ascended through this aperture, j tnd found themselves on the floor of a large log ' {pfeiV-Oiohead-quarters of tho robbors, who «cm5So l their real character under the guise of | itar-AsrentM and traders.
t The party tarried but a few momenta in the I cabin, and 011 issuing therefrom, found them- 1 gives in the heart of Stony Cliff, whose honest ; Mttlsrs were allftist asleep.
The tarty, however, soon made their presence : known to tbs settteraj and the whole village was j miickly astif, filled with joy aEd surprise—joy i prer the rtocne of Sylveen and Martha, and rur- ;
the discovery of Soofct Shirely beint; : pirate Paul, and that ms den was within their I wryanidstJ	---1
Omaha and Old Shadow wore sent out after (lose'left In camp up the river, and when they fetomed with the female frieivlsof the Avengers, toy were welcomed to the hospitality of the {dace, and cared for with all that kindness char-Jctenstic of Uie honest-heirted men and women
3	fee bonier. And the Avangsrs, one and all, ; is Well as their friends, were made to feel at jase and at home.
k Two weeks passed, and found them still at tho tillage, resting and preparing for a journey to— they scarcely Know where.
Bat these two weeks were fraught with great Interest, joy and happiness to the sojourners at jjtony Cliff. Fred Travis aud Vida renewed < their love vows, walked in the cool forest aisles, , jowed upon the river, aud talked and sung as though their young hearts had never felt the pangs of grief, nor bitterness of despair.
Nor were Ralph St. Leger and Sylvoen Gray | less happy in each other’s society—the cheerful Hzht of each other’s eyes and the music of each | rtner's voice.	j
■	And there were other joyous hearts besides, j there were lovers in that little band of Avengers, and sweethearts were among those rescue 1 j from the Indians, and theirs was a love strengthened by long months of cruel separation, despair . ind suffering. If to them the night had been dark, the morning was all the more radiant.
■	SyWeen Gray was greatly surprised, if not a tittle horror-stricken, when she learned that her lovsr.was-the terrible being. Death-Notch; but , ■shea she as well as the settlers had learned the ; cause of his vengeance, and that he was not so 'terrible as was reputed, they could not censure Mm for the oourse he had pursued, in wreaking retribution on the agents of his sorrow.
Ralph did not, however, tell them of tbe fcreat | itateof semi-consciousness under which m >st of Us terrible deeds had been performed. But. by keeping aloof from the war-path, and in the presence of his adored Sylveen, he effectually overcame that terrible passion of mad revenge, which was proof of itself, that it came of no jihystcal or mental debility, bat of a highly ex-dtoWe temperament that had been cultivated iB its freaks, instead of being restrained. v One thing, however, stands yet to be explain- , td in connection with Death-Notch. It will bo remembiTod tbat, on the nigat of the storm at fits solitary hut in the forest, he drew from the I bosom of his huntinr-shirt a flattened bullet, 'which had evidently been aimed at his heart by slurking foe; and also when taken prisoner by the savages, near his own cabin; how the inhuman foe sought to torture him by shooting burn-warrowt into his breast, and how he bore this tomre with unflinching fortitude. The whole pcret of this wonderful fortitude was this: beneath his hunting-shirt ho wore a steel jacket, something like the coat of mail worn by p8 warriors of the Middle A.ge«. This iacket load one ■ been his father's; the latter bad onco been a member of a secret organization In the Joath, and the steel jacket ana iron mask worn by Ralph, and to which bis life was owing on ignore than one occasion, were a part of the ro-psUa worn by that secret order.
VThus the ■ mysteries connected with Death-.fljtch stand explained, which were no mysteries ftf V all.
CHAPTER XLH.
THBEE TSARS AFTER.
Stt yrae early morning, wlion a band of eight Pereons, habited as hunters, stood beneath tho Wabragoous shadows of a great forest oak. ^TOey were all young men, yet the faces of some wore overgrown with heavy beards, and jjtuers were just “ sporting ” their first mus-•tsche, and one of them was beardless and iprotued, but he was an Indian.
These men were the bone and muscle, if you ■will - aooepfe- thp term, of the flourishing- htfclei ssttteinont of Fairview. They were away from home than on a few days' hunt, in joying a holi-insy from the field and plow.
We have met with these persons before, dear i/Wadcr, yet we can scarcely recognize in those I f*™, boarded, manly faces, the once almost boyish features of tbe Spirit Lake Avengers. But it j,sss o»!y required three yean to effect this
“Salvation!” exclaimed the old hunter.
“ Heaven is a leetle partial with its gifts, but ‘ God's will be done.’ ”
The party rode into the settlement and dis-mouhted. Old S&aSafcfKfras received with the gifattwt Joj, and era Vied with the other to make him comfortable and happy.
The old fellow never left Fairview. Its good people prevailed on him to spend the -remainder of his days there, and he accepted their lont't offer. He was tiie happiest mah in tbe sottlfi- I ment, too, for by those little ones that he loved so dearly, he was known only as “grandpa.” '* Omaha ever remained a friend to the wliites. and as “ Josh, the Friendly,” he stands forward in the history of lows as one of the truest friends of the white setter.
I	have only to add tbat the name and deeds of Death-Notch are stall remembered in the North-west; and there are those who can still point out to you trees tbat onco bore the Death-Notch, the totem of the young Scalj/-Hunter.
THE END.
