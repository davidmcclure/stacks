CHAPTER L
THE HERO.
_ Ik a small log-cabiu, a story and a half high, Kituated on tbe edge of a timber-ialand, in the Stfcte of Illinois, and npon the banks of Vermilion Creek, was bom in the year 1887 James Butler Hikok, wbo, by the strange nomenclature of the border, won from his cotarades in after years the name of Wild Bill.
Sketches Jonumerable,. poemp, and. novels have bsed "written of the- mafrVelous man who
has won tbe abovo strange sobriquet, and well K«wifafcail*it. bis. thrilling id van turae will fnnrtBtnSKRrra.1 enough'to interest all classes of readers, I g*#a la the- following pages incidents of daring, peril and romance, which are worthy of the belief that truth is stranger than fiction.
Even in his earliest boyhood Wild Bill won a name for darhjg, tearless horsemanship and a crack boy marksman, and his early training served him well in after years.	‘ \
For fire-arms ht bad a passion, and he set himself to work at eight years of age, to possess as his own a pony, rifle, pistol- and knife.	T*.
Busy with the affair? of bis farm, and the improvement of his new borne, then in the wilds of tbo Par West, aa was Illinois at that time, Mr. Hikok had little time to watch the growing hero in bis household, and to all his begging for a pistol and a pony, put him off from day to day, until yoang Jim—for it must be remembered that be did not win the name of Wild Bill until he hod reached man’s estate - determined to procure those necessary, as he believed, properties to a border boy’s comfort Mid education.
How to net about it be did,not exactly know; but an idea was suggested to him by hearing bis father and a neighbor discussing the' circumstance of the State having offered a premium for tbe scalps of wolves, as those animals had become so destructive to the cattle of settlers.
Watching his opportunity, when the family were away from home one day, Jimmy set to work with hatchet and nails, and soon constructed some distance from the cabin a most unique pen of a double character as a trap in which to catch wolves.
It was so constructed that .there was a pen within a pen, and tbe inner top*' was to be used as a receptacle for his bait,>4i&cl the .outer one as the trap. r-- ..-..k;.
Jimmy made ttfam both remarkably secure, for the strength of the inner one the life of his pet pig depended upon, and the -outer one must be strong enough to bold the game when oaughfc.'
Jimmy had a pet pig a neighbor had given him, and this little aatinal was taken down to bis trap and securely fastened up within the inner pen, and thf trap was so set that when the wolves went in un^er tbe log outer pen to interview piggy, down would come the log cage over them. *
Jimmy’s pig did net seem to relish the affair, evidently.believing, when he aw the poutri-vancet that he was to be used as a cat’s paw; but he %ri»?*B0stad. well, and then bis young master ntired^.x*a$.|*Bilte.
Hardly had Jimmy gotten a quarter of a mile away toward tbe house, when piggy be-
gan to.squeal at a rate that touched the boy’s heartl and he determined to go back and release Urn and use his mother’s pet cat for bait; but upon his arrival he saw that the trap bad fallen, and if the pig was frightened to death, nearly, In tbe interior, there were three wolves equally as alarmed at being captives in the outer department.
Fbr just such a climax Jimmy had prepared by fastening an old bowle knife into the end of a strong pole, and be went to work with such good wUl that he soon massacred tbe wolves and returned in triumph to his cabin, so elated with his success that he forgot the woes of tbe pig in bis delight at having layed the foundation of his fortune, which was to purchase for him a pony, rifle and pistol.
With his three scalps he sought his father upon his return and told him of his wolf-trap, and Mr. Hikok was so delighted that he at once went with Jimmy to see his machine.
As they drew near, the squealing of the pig told Jimmy that he had made another capture, in<f, di^overing two more wolves in bis trap, he showed his father bis modus operandi of ending the lives of the beasts and scalping
fttnty,of .thi»trapfWn that Jimmy soon got enoMgh'money ft-om bla scalp*’to buy hi* pony, saddle tend bridle, a small rifle, pistol and bowie knife, and he considered himself ‘made, and ;at once released piggy from his seeming peril, determined to bunt for wolves in a more minly way.
Before proceeding further we may relate the following true episode as indicative of the boy’s good nature and his wonderful courage.
It was just after he entered his teens that he went with some neighbors to a distant ranch to drive buck a herd of cttttle.
The afteriioon of their arrival the party had put lip at a small tavern, the proprietor of which had a feeling pf iU-will against the father of Jimmy Hikok, and which his wife also joined him'in.
The merits of the case Jimmy know little about, other than that all had insisted in saying that bis father was right, and the tavern proprietor wrong.
Upon this score, however, the tavern-keeper deemed himselMn the right, and, learning tbat the boy was a son of bis old enemy, refused to permit him to remain at his tavern.
This troubled tbe youth but little, for be went to the woods near by, threw himself up a brush shelter, aud, having provisions, was cooking his evening meal with tbe utmost unconcern, when he heard screams toward the tavern.
Instantly he ran in that direction, and discovered all in a wild state of confusion, for a huge bear had run down from the hill* taken the baby-girl of the tavern-keeper from tbe door-ttep, where it lay asleep, and ran off with 11
Most of the men living at the place were away, getting up the cattle, and the few who were there began to organise a hunt for the ferocious beast, having no hope of saving tbe child; but Jimmy Hikok armed only with his pistols and knife, at once started in pursuit, the terrified mother Bbowing him in which direction tbe bear had gone.
Jimmy was fleet of foot, and possessed wonderful powers of endurance, and set off at a swift run, which soon brought him in sight of the bear.
In his mouth, his teeth firmly holding the clothes, the bear carried the infant, « hich was screaming with fright Instantly Jimmy determined to attack the beast, making him drop his prey and turn on him.
Boldly he ran after tbe brute, came within pistol range, and, confident in bis unerring aim, fired.
The bear gave a savage growl, and at once sprung forward with greater speed. The boy saw that he limped, and exerting himself the more, loading ad be ran, now drew quite near, and stopping suddenly, again fired.
This time tbe beast dropped tbe screaming
infant, and savagely turned upon his yfl
foeman.	’
But, nothing daunted, the brave.youtk| advancing toward him, loading as be wentjl soon was upon him, when be halted, ■ almost at arm’s length fired fairly in the ■ of the huge monster, a-i be stood upon bis ■ legs. Bruin dropped at the shot, but onll an instant, and then rose and savagely n9 upon tbe boy.	J
But again the youth met him, this time • the one pistol he bad loaded, still graspinl other into which he had only had time to til some powder.	1
Perfectly calm he had tbe presence of ■ to aim for tbe eyes of tbe brute, and with! good result that be blinded Bruin, and J dropped him, just as the crowd of men ^ tbe tavern came in sight j Blinded, wounded, and mad with rage I pain, the beast tried to get hold of bis foe* Jimmy kept out of reacb, at tbe same ■ loading his pistols once more, and again ■ him their contents, which there and then el the monster’s life, while be bounded fori and raising the still shrieking child in his al gave it to it* father, who just tbei caml One glance was su£Bc:ent to show tbe that, excepting a few^-oratches aflU a ft I frtgbt, the baby seas not injured, and.tyel turned to Jimmy, and said with treu>fl voice:" •	•
“ My boy, you’ve got your revenge^ on ■ so'don’t spare me "	1
“ I didn’t want any revenge, sir: it wfl my quarrel, and you knew best wbo you wafl in your house, and I didn’t mind roughiiifl out doors,” was Jimmy’s answer.	1
“ Forgive me, boy, and come back with! anil tbe best I’ve got you’ll be welcome to,I I’ll bury the hatchet between tbe old manl myself. Come, Jimmy, come, pards, ue’lfl back and have a good time, and I'll dresM bear skin for you, boy, as a reminder of ^ you’ve done this day.”
And back to the tavern they went, and t ever after Jimmy Hikok was tbe favored g After the success of his wolf-baiting bad vided Jimmy with all tbe necessary et ments of the hunter, be could not sta; home.
Armed with his weapons, and mounted \ Beauty, as he named his ti’uly fleet aud h some pony, Jimmy scoured the country half a hundred miles around, frequently maining alone at night in the forests or on prairie, knowing no fear, and building l constitution and nerve that were to servo weU in after years.
His parents were anxious to have him al school, and sent him to a teacher living n miles away, where he soon laid the foundi of an education, which never in after life be able to continue, as far as books t though ever was he a student of nature human nature.
Duty elsewhere calling the teacher a’ Jimmy, at.the age of fourteen, took to the path on the Illinois and Michigan canal, here he aw tbe first serious adventure n life, when in his fifteenth year, and whict be related in tbe foUowing chapter.
CHAPTER II.
THE CABAL BUCCAMEKR8.
Wmr.it on the tow-path ofc tbe canal, Jii Hikok became a very popular youth wit with whom be came in contact; but be undemonstrative and rather taciturn in hi tore, doubtless having become so from his i days and nights of solitude in the prairie forest, and trotting along behind the canal horses, or riding them, and having no « speak to for hours at a time.
One night when the boat waa in “ port,1 ready to draw out at daybreak, he lay a in bis bonk, when he was awakened by t in the cabin.
What be beard was no more than a y\ several men, w'tli ■ raptaiti of tb<- '<«
•n
UMI
ttack it tfa* following night, at a desolate spot o tbe canal, rob it of some treasure of tbe oropany whiob it would carry, and, escaping pith their booty, to share all rouad.
Jimmy wai horrified at the rascally plot, apd etermined, as soon as tbe men left the cabin,
0	get up and make tbe affair known; but to is alarm they bad just departed, wbeu he was ailed up to go abead with bis horses, and the oat was pulled oat on her trip, it being at a »ely plaoe on the canal, and no one Dear to all upon, for tbe captain bad distinctly said bat two of his “ bands ” were with him, and Dr the eootpand the two path-boys be did not are,
, Jimmy plodded along, thinking bow he could Ircumvent the canal buccaneers, and at lari, ■me to tbe conclusion that be would make the Stempt at any rate.
•	He knew the spot chosen for the robbery fell, and be would be on the tow-path at the itme, and bad heard their plan to stop him, tell dm they were passengers wbo wished to gtt ft board, and tben they were to seise him, halt Be borsee, board the boat and bind the captain Ed crew, and after securing the treasure, rive away in the vehicle in which they bad Ime to tbe canal.
•	Having formed his plan, wben relieved from bty, ati was his wont, Jimmy remained a few foments with the boy who was bis tow path artner, and very little questioning showed im that be would be bis ally at any rate.
Going on board, Jimmy looked at a new nrchase be had made with the money earned p tbe tow-path.
It was a Colt’s revolver, and at that timaan ©common weapon, and he was as proud of\ it
•	he coo Id be.
' Loading it carefully, with bis single-barreled istols, tbe one tbe wolfs scalps had bought or him, be laid it in big trunk, and then sought est
Late in tbe afternoon he arose and again rent on the path, telling bis partner of his San.
• ‘ Buck,” be said, “ tbe captain and tbe two ends are in the job, and just before I come on tonight I’ll manage to get them into the hold ngetber, under tbe excuse of a bad leak is the lull, and then I’ll just shut ’em up there, and fou can guard 'em while I go on the path.
1	“ I’m a good shot as you know, and wben pose three men come up to seize me, 111 just •pen on them with my Colt’s, and then we'll eve fun, you bet”
“But they may kill you, Jimmy," suggested lock.
“Guess not; but I’ve got to take those hanoes, Buck, and mind you, I leave you the |ngl&-barrel pistols, and if old Skillets, the bok, puU on any airs, just nail hioi, for this joat has got thirty thousand dollars on her be-tinging to the company, and we’ve got to save I from the pirates.”
ITbus it was arranged, and as cool as an icicle |as Jimmy when be was awakened to take ps trick on the path.
■: He went forward, and, calling to the captain and two men, said he felt confident that there was aleak in the hold, as be could hear She water running.
Getting lanterns, tbe three men hastily depended into the hold, and instantly Jimmy flfged the trap upon them and bolted it | 8killets, the cook, was asleep, and Jimmy galled to his pard:
L ‘‘B“ck’ 1 „haV6 ’em ««ed, »o -pull in and
kell change.”
■ “Ay, ayr called back Buck, and in ten tniliute* more he was walking the . canal boat feck, the pistols Jimmy had given him in bis bands, and listening to the muffled cunes and pammnlng of tbe captain and his crew below.
I The noise soon brought Skillets out of his r““’ h« sided with tbe captain and crew W>d picked up an ax with which to attack Buck! <*bo Instantly called to Jimmy for aid, as be begjn to weaken.
Jimmy ytJlod back to bim to run the boat B®** amott, slid, as be jumped r n board.
Skillets made for Buck, but was met by the youth of whom be stood something in awe.
Putting his revolver down on the deck, and telling Buck to still keep at the helm, Jimmy ran in upon Skillets, and at once a savage fight began for mastery.
Tbe boy was tall, wiry, as active as a panther, quick as a flash, and very strong for his age; but Skillets was a stout-bodied man, and the two rolled over and over tbe deck together until they went overboard into tbe canal.
Buck, in alarm, stopped the boat by running it in to tbe shore, and ran to the side to see tbe fight, which still continued fiercely in tbe water.
It was Jimmy who had thrown himself overboard, dragging Skillets with him, as he felt he was the stronger on a solid surface, and knew he could master him in the water.
But Skillets fought with fury, and yet slowly failed in strength, until Jimmy at last felt bis hold relax.
“ Here, Buck, throw me a rope, and we’ll draw him on deck,” said tbe youth, and, fastening it around the body of the man, he drew himself up on the canal-boat, and tben the two hauled the body on board.
“Now let us move on, Buck,so get tbe team started while I change for a dry suit”
This did not take many minutes, and, armed with bis revolver, Jimmy was soon mounted on the lead horse, while Buck guided the boat up the canal.
“ Sing, Buck, to drown tbe voices of that caged gang,” called out Jimmy, and Buck ili^-as requested, and along tbe dark canal tbe boat moved, the voice of the youth starting many echoes in the dark and dismal forests.
At last the spot selected as tbe soene for the attack of the buccaneers, was just ahead, and Jimmy drew a long breath aud bis revolver at the same time.
Suddenly two men came in sight, and one of them called out:
“Hold on, towboy, we want to get on board.”
“ I can’t stop,” said Jimmy.
“ By Heaven you shall; knock him off with your stick, Sam,” cried tbe man.
It was the intention of Sam to obey, but suddenly a flush illumined the darkness of tbe forest and the man fell dead, while the other instantly fired upon Jimmy.
Down went tbe horse be rode; but the youth nimbly caught on bis feet, and a second, third aud fourth shot was rapidly fired by him, and in his tracks, as he turned to fly, fell the second robber.
Bounding forward into the road, which crossed tbe canal by a bridge a little way above, Jimmy found a carriage there, to wbich were hitched two horses, and their driver was endeavoring to curb their fright, and turn them into the road as if to fly.
But Jimmy ran close up to him and said:
“ Hold on, for I want ydu too.”
“Don’t shoot!” yelled the man.
“ Then get out.”
“ I’ll do it.”
“Ho, Buck! come here!” cried Jimmy, in a loud tone.
Buck had been alarmed greatly at the shots, but hearing Jimmy’s voice at once sprung on shore, and coming up the driver was quickly disarmed, for he carried a pistol, and securely bound.
Tben tbe dead man, tbe first Jimmy bad shot, the wounded one, who was the second he had fired on, and the prisoner, were carried on board, and tbe two youths set to work to resume their way, having bitched the carriage homes to tbe tow-line.
The wounded man was dying, it was evident *md Jimmy took the tow-path and hastened on, while Buck held the tiller, and in a couple of hours’ time they reached a village, where they reported what bad happened.
The constablo and justice came down and released the captain und his men from the bold, and as the driver had contented all, they were taken to prison, while tbe bodies of tbe
two buccaneers, for the second bad died, war* buried, Skillets having revived in time to prevent their burying him as a dead man.
For this adventure Jimmy was made captain of a canal boat, though but fifteen, and presented with a purse by the company; but as canal buccaneers were scarce, and be longed tor adventure, he soon after left for other scenes, for danger was to him a pleasure.
CHAPTER IH.
| SHANGHAI BILL.
In his search for fields of adventure Jimmy naturally turned his gaze toward Kansas and Missouri, tben the scenes of a border warfare growing from incipiency to the size of >» giant as the weeks progressed.
He had, after leaving the canal, gone home for a visit, and remained there for. quite a while, aiding his father and brothers on the farm; but with wbat money be bad, be concluded to set out for St. Louis, and after a sojourn of a year in that husy city, look a steamer to Leavenworth, Kansas, where he arrived at a time when the excitement consequent to making tbe State open to slavery, was at its higbt.
His first landing in Kansas convinced him that he bad struck tbe right field pf adventure, for a fight was in progress as he went nshore, which ended in tbe death of a number of' he participants.
Failing in an effort to secure employment at once, Jimmy sought to enlist himself with tbe “Red Legs,” an anti-slav<ry command under the leadership of tbe noted Jim Lane.
This band numbered some three hundred men, all thoroughly armed and mounted; but not having the wherewithal to purchase a horse aud complete equipment, be was refused as a Red Log Ranger, greatly to his distress.
But a few days after the Red Legs went out on tbe commons to shoot with rifles and pistols for prizes, and Jimmy determined to ring in if ho could.
To attract attention, when any one shot and did not drive tbe bull's-eye* be laughed in a satirical way, until at last one of tbe Red Legs turned fiercely upon bim and said:
“Look a beur, boy, you has toomucb laugh, as ef you c’u’d do better, an’ durn- my skins, ef yer bain’t a Red Leg, I’ll give yer a chunce ter shoot.
“ Ef yer takes ther prize, I’ll pay yer put-up dust, an’ ef yer don’t, I’ll take the hickory ramrod o’ my rifle an’ welt yer nigh ter death.
“ Does yer shoot on my tarms?”
“ I will, and beat you too,” was the quiet response.
All eyes had been turned on the tall, band-some youth before, and several had determined to try bis mettle, after tbe shooting, for having laughed at tbem, and now they gazed on him with increased interest, from tbe cool manner in which he asserted his superiority aa a marksman.
There were three prizes, viz:
A fine horse, saddle and bridle for the first; a rifle, and belt with two revolvers and a bo wie knife for the second, and a purse of one hundred dollars for the third.
Jimmy had some little money, and said quietly:
“ I’ll pay tbe fees, for I want no man to give me money.’’
“ Then shell out; it’s fifteen fertber first, ten fer ther second, and five dollars ter ther third prize, an’ ther boys hes all chipped in, an’ ef yer don’t win, buy, they’ll all see me larrup yer ”
The speaker, Shanghai Bill, all knew, and greatly feared, for he was a desperado of tbe worst type, a giant in size and strength, und ever ready to get into a brawl.
Jimmy smiled at bis words, paid his thirty dollars, which left him with three in his pocket, and after tbe Red Legs had shot took his stand and raising his rifle quickly, fired.
Tbe first to start tbe cheer was Jim Tjmm himself, who cried out:
4
“By Heaven I the best shot in the three hundred.'’
“ It’s a accidint; besides, general, thar’s two more to be shouted.” growled Shanghai Bill.
The two more were then shot in tbe same quick way as before, and the bullets found dead center.
“I’ve got tbe horse, saddle and bridle towards becoming a Red Leg, general," said Jimmy quietly, addressing Laue.
“You have indeed; now, see if you can win tbe arms, and egad, I believe you can,” was Lane’s reply.
These were to be shot for with pistols, and at twenty paces, the best two in three shots, and once more Jimmy scored three dead oen-ter bull's-eyes.
The men now became deeply interested in the tall, handsom« youth, and watched eagerly for him Co come to his third trial, which was to be with a rifle at a moving object, a hundred yards off.
This object was a round piece of wood, painted red, which was to be rolled, like a wheel, along the ground, and at it thr«e shots were given.
Just as the man who rolled it started it in motion, a crow flew over the field above the heads of tbe crowd, and instantly raising his rifle Jimmy fired, aad brought him down, while he immediately seised the weapon held by Shanghai Bill and throwing it to a level, rent a bullet through th« red wheel ere it had stopped rolling.
This double feat, and one shot with a strange rifle, set the crowd wild with enthusiasm, while it only angered Shanghai Bill who growled forth:
“ You has done ther bhootin’ squar’, an’ won all ther prizes, pard; so yer escapes ther lickin' on thet score; but yer hes tuk a liberty with my rifle I never allows, an’ I’ll jist tan yer hide fer thet.”
“ Lay your band on me and I’ll kill you,” was Jimmy’s calm response.
But Shanghai Bill at once replied:
“ I guess I’ll slit yer ears, so as I’ll know yer ag’in,” and he drew his knife. “Keep offl” and Jimmy stepped backward, while he dropped his band on his revolver.
“Oh! thet’s yer leetle game are itf Waal, I’ll jine yer.”
And tbe desperado drew his revolver; but it was the last act of his life, as square in the lorehead went the youth’s bullet, and the bully of the Red Legs was a deud num.
“Bravo for the boy! He's killed the Shanghai! What's yer name, my young feller? ’ yelled one of the men.
‘-Call me anything you please; I don’t care,” v as the calm response.
“ Then Shanghai Bill is yer handle, fer ther lied Legs can’t git along without one o’ thet name. Boys, this are new Shanghai BUL"
A wild yell greeted the announcement, and Jim Hikok was at once enlisted as a Red Leg, and became known as Shanghai Bill, a name that clung to him nnlil changed for that of Wild Bill.
CHAPTER IV.
THJE YOCXG RANQIR.
During his time of service in the company i f Jim Lane, as a Red Leg Ranger, Bill, as I thaU now call him, performed many deeds of \ alor, and was pronounced by his oommander the most daring man in his command.
Without going over his mauy deetts nf daring and bair-breadth escapes as a y< ur>g Ranker,
1 will refer to one incident that whd i<> s!r>w his indomitable nerve, and nt tLo sa;:io lime that his heart was in the right place.
Upon one of his solitary rides, or scouts. Bill came to a pleasant home, where he asked shelter for the night, as be was feeling quite ill, tbe t Sects of a severe cold*
The permission was given, the host little dreaming that he was entertaining unawares i be opted Shanghai Bill, the Red Leg Banger, 'vho, as a partisan on tbe oCber side he would iiave been delighted to capture.
AcLvjentures of Wild Bill.
The following morning when the host went to caU Bill, he found him unable to rise, suffering as be was with a high fever and aches in every bone.
A doctor was sent for and he prescribed for tbe patient, and yet Bill continually grew worse and soon bis life was despaired of; but his strong constitution caused him to at last rally and he recuperated rapidly, and at last got well enough to undertake the ride back into Kansas, and most warmly thanked bis host apd his family, who had been untiring in their nursing of tbe stranger.
Touched by their devotion to hirii, Bill said: “ I know not how to thank you for alt you have done for me, bpt hope sometime to prove my appreciation.”
The host replied:
“ Do so, by sometimes showing a kindness to any of our side who may faU into your hands, Shanghai Bill”
“Ha! you know me?”
“ Yes, for in your delirium you told us who you are. I had believed you a monster, from all reports, but now I know to the contrary; but, no matter what yon were, yon came here side and we oared for you.’*
Bill was deeply affected by their kindness and dared not trust himself to reply, and shortly after took his leave. Upon his return to the Red Legs he told his experience, made known to each one of tbe command wbo the kind host was and where he resided, and begged him to always spare any of his property or himself, if it was in his power.
Some weeks after he boldly went to the pleasant farm-house again, to pass the night, and was received kindly, and thanked for many goodnesses shown them by the Red Legs raiding through.
A short while after a small party of his foes were found in Kansas, committing fearful outrages, and being captured, were about to t-e executed summarily, when Bill came upon the scene and suddenly recognized one, a handsome youth, aa the son of his host.
“Boys, you must spare this one,” he said quietly, and be cut the ropes that bound the pale, trembling youth.
“No, Shanghai Bill, we won’t do it, not even for you, as this is a bad lot and he was caught with ’em,” was the reply.
“Nevermind; he shall not die, and I will answer for it that he won’t be caught in such bad company again.”
But all of Bill’s entreaties were of no avail, as the Red Legs were determined to sacrifice the boy.
Seeing that begging would do no good, Bill offered to purchase the youth from his captors; but they were not to be prevailed npon, and seeing it be took another tack, and said calmly:	A *
“Boys, I have asked you to spare this youth, and you refuse; I have offered to pay you a ransom for him and you won’t receive it, and now I tell you frankly, aud you know me, I think—you shaU not kill this lad!”
“Shall Dot is big words, Shanghai,” growled one.
*• HI back my words, Purdy.”
“Guess you'll have to, for we won’t give the boy up.”
“Take him then, if you wish to die.”
A man, bolder than the rest stepped forward and laid a heavy hand upon the youth’s shoulder, when the arm, broken by a bullet, fell helpless at his side.
Instantly there were a dozen weapons drawn; but Bill placed himself in front of tbe youth, and with a revolver in each hand faced tbe crowd, aud said calmly:
“Take him, pards, if you wish to.”
But the leader of the captors did not desire trouble with Shanghai Bill, who was the most popular man in the command, and besides, he knew well Bill’s deadly aim, and he said coax-ingly:
“ Come, pards, let us give him up to Bill, for he is but a boy anyhow.”
“ All right,” was the general cry, for tboee
in front of Bill’s revolvers did not kJ
b»ppy-	J
“ I thank you, gentlemen. Purdy, get tfl? doctor to fix your arm up; go to the best hoUn and send tbe bills to me,” and Shanghai walked away with his young friend.
Arriving at his camp, he turned to the txfl and asked:
“How is it you were with that gang fl horse-thieve6, bouse-burners and murderers The youth seemed confused, and tben al
swered:
“ I sought to find you, and joined them merfl ly to get into your lines, as they said thifl would make a raid into Kansas.”
“ But why to seek me?”
“ Bill, do yon not know met I am not Hj Halstead, but his twin sister, Sophie.” 'I Bill was astounded, for he now saw befoiB him the lovely girl who had so kindly cared fofl him during his sickness, and who, loving hid desperately, had disguised herself in her twiia brother's clothes, and come to join him.
But BUI did not love her, and frankly tellis! her so, carried her back to her father’s honifl with him, and there left her.
It was long months before be again vista® the Missouri farm-house, and wben he did, tij found that poor Sophie was sleeping in the vifl lage churchyard, her nature be'ng to ldolixJ rather than love, and loving the idol, it carafl her to wilt away like a flower an* at last d#j of a broken heart.	"
Upon leaving off his connection with the Redl Legs, BUI went further West, and readiljl gained employment as a stage-driver from al point in Kansas to Santa Fe.
He had been a passenger on a coach which! bad been baited by roadagents, who had otf hue bad things pretty much their own way. $ But, though the driver’s hands n ent prompt!: ly up at the stern order, “Throw up vouig hands,” BUI bad no idea of being robbed nf tbtfj little he had, and riding on the box. he yelled1 out:
“ Drive on, man, and run em down!" ^ But the Jehu had no such ideo, and Bill laidj the whip on the horses just as the shots came':. rattltDg at the coach, while be replied with bis'fl revolver and dropped two of the robbers. F Tbe driver, however, fell from his box, shot j through the heart, and seizing tbe reins in one j hand, using his revolver with his other, and yelling like a wild Comanche, BiU ran the! gantlet of the road-agents, who were unused to that style of procedure, and got through in -safety with a large sum of money they had for , the company to pay off its men.
Of course it was aU reported in due form, and BUI was offered a position as driver, which, be readily accepted, and it was noticed that his. coach went through every time, where others were not so fortunate.
After be bad been driving a few months, Bill one day picked up a strange passenger, who preferred to ride with bim on the box.
BUI found bim a quiet yet pleasant companion, handsome as a picture, very young and very tad-looking, and with a smile which he often said afterward was so mournful that be had rather see him cry than laugh.
Of his antecedents Bill could find out nothing. and he often wondered why such a refined, j retiring youth had come to that wUd country, where there seemed nothing in common to one of his traits.
To BUl’s surprise the youth went back over the road with him, still occupying his seat by him on the box.
Again, on tbe trip out be was in his accustomed place, and after half a dozen trips be became known as “ Bill’s Strango Pard.”
He always promptly settled his pacsago-money, and seemed, as be said, to only tcke the tripe for the ride.
Several times tbe road-agents bad attacked the stage; but with Bill’s usual good luck he

had gone through, with the loss of a passenger, a wounded horse, and a few scratches.
In each case Bill’s Strange Pard had drawn a weapon, and though not firing it, had scanned the road-agents’ faoee eagerly, as though searching for some one.
And one day that some one for whom be searched was found, for as the agents called a halt one afternoon in a lonely pass of tbe mountains, the strange passenger suddenly uttered a cry, just as Bill was about to rush through, and raising his weapon, fired.
The chief of the road-ageuts fell, and the young man was about to spring to the ground, but Bill seised him with a gripe of iron and drove on.
But the youth begged and implored him to let him go, and at last succeeded in releasing I himself, as Bill had to take tbe reins in both [hands, and sprung to the ground.
| 'He lighted on his feet all right, and dabbed back down the road and disappeared from sight.
- Bill was no man to go back on a pard, and he had become attached to the youth, so at once came to a bait, and sung out:
" Pilgrims, you just wait a bit, and look after my team until I come back.”
The passengers demurred, but Bill was determined, and taking off his leader, he threw himself upon bis back and dashed back after his 'Strange Pard.
His coming at a gallop put the road agents to ‘flight, all except one, he whom the Strange Tard had shot down, and he lay upon the roadside where he had fallen, and over him knelt %be youth.
Bill dashed up, dismounted, and cried :
I “ Look here, pard, what the devil did you play this trick for?”
The avehger turned upon him and said: “Bill, I came here for a purpose, and 1 have kept an oath I made three years ago. This man won my love, deceived me, killed my old father who sought to avenge my wrongs, and ®“d. In male attire I have tracked him, and ? have avenged my father’s death and my wrong, for he is dead, as yon see.”
‘ Bfll did see, for tbe road-agent chief lay dead, and, as there was a reward on his head, he nnickly shouldered him, carried him back to the fcoach, and putting him on top, was soon in readiness to proceed, the woman, as the Strange l*ard was now known to be, silently mounting •o her old seat.
' As they drew near the station, she said:
^ “Do not betray me, Bill.”
“Wot I, little onel” was the prompt answer. ; The next day on the way back the Strange 'Pard took her last ride with Bill, for she bade tdm farewell at tbe station, and the two parted, %he giving him orders to collect the reward for £he head of the road-agent chief and hold it tontil she sent for it.
I He did collect it, but to the day of his death |he had never sent for the reward, doubtless yeing satisfied with her revenge, and Bill never ward again of his Strange Pard.
CHAPTER VI.
TH* SPIRIT OF THE CAWTOlf.
Wmu on the Overland Stage Line Bill’s drives between stations were- several times changed, and once, owing to his splendid manner of going over the worst roads the darkest Bights without accident, and arriving on time, be was put on a mountain run, as the |distance between posts was called.
He bad not driven the nPw route more than once, when he discovered that there was a (mod reason for the drivers not caring to go through the mountains at night.	^
This reason, which be discovered himself of was whispered to him, was Z *OCOQ?tot* to?®1*	through which
and^ridw ’ haoat«1 b-v a ghostly horse
th^l r0*d a*ent bad been cap-tared wd hanged by the Vigilantes on a large that grew at the mouth of the canyon,
and the man was burled at its foot, and each night, dating from a few weeks after the banging, a spectral horse and rider was seen at the tree, and, waiting until the stage came in sight, would gallop before it through the canyon, and then mysteriously disappear.
Several times some courageous driver had endeavored to overtake the spirit by rapid driving; but it had always kept a certain distance in advance, and invariably at tho other end of the canyon would disappear.
The dead road-agent had ridden in life a snow-white horse, and dressed in deep black, and so was this specter dressed in black, and his steed was white, as had been plainly seen on light moonlight nights.
The driver that went through in the daytime never saw tho Spirit of the Canyon; but the one who drove at night, either be it light moonlight or dark and stormy, always saw the Spirit.
Bill, on his first trip through went by day several times to learn the road, and not a driver spoke to him upon the subject, even when he remarked with satire:
“ You must be weak ribbon-holders, pards, on this end of the line, not to be able to drive that road with your eyes shut.”
The first night drive he took he went through without difficulty.
The second night likewise, and he said nothing of seeing anything out of the usual run.
Tbe third night, just as he came near the canyon he quickened tbe pace of his team,, while he remarked to himself:
“ That is the third time I have jumped that fellow right there, and it looks strange. Come, pets, step along, and we’ll give the dyspeptics inside a shaking up, and see if we can’t catch up with that white horse.”
On went the team, and yet tbe horseman kept tbe same distance in advance, and though Bill got the animals into a run and shook tbe stage so wildly the passengers thought it was a runaway, he did not gain on the specter.
“ Well, that is curious,” and putting on the heavy California brakes as he spoke, he drew the team to standstill, and continued:
“I can’t bear his horse’s hoof-beats; it is curious."
Bill drove on once more and discovered that the strange rider turned off at the same place be had the two nights before, and when he went into the station he told tbe story of his seeing tbe mysterious horseman, and at once every tongue was loosened aud he learned that tbe drivers bad called it a spirit, and after seeing it several times got sick and died, or met with some accident.
“ Bah I they were a superstitious set of fools, and I'll take my chances,” was his contemptuous reply, and each night after that he saw tbe Spirit of the Canyon in good weather and storm.
One afternoon he asked an extra hand who was not on duty to drive for him that night.
“ Not I, Bill, though I’ll lend you money and do all I can for you,” was the reply.
“Then drive for me, Dan, for I will go along too.”
“Oh! then I'll do it”
“ Well, you handle the ribbons, and Fll ride behind the stage on.Bonny Bess, and when we reach the canyon and see the ghost, Til go in chase while you drive on.”
“ Don’t do it, Bill, for—”
“ I wfll do it, Dan, so keep dark."
That night the stage rolled away from the station just at sunset, with Dan Rigby on the box, and Bill, mounted upon his splendid mare Bonny Bess, and thoroughly armed, riding close behind the vehicle.
Some who knew his errand shook their heads; but Bill did not care, and kept Bess in a canter until the canyon was reached.
It was a bright moonlight night, and in that region the moon, and stars too, shine with uncommon brilliancy, and objects were plainly visit la.
“Look, Bill 1"cried Dan in a loud whisper, as the spectral horseman was seen to ride out
from the shelter of tbe road-agento’ tree, and daah into the canyon.
“Come, BeasI”
Like an arrow from tbe bow the spleedid mare shot away from the stage at the opll of her master, and began to gain upon the spirit horseman.
But only for an instant, as looking back tbe sable-clad rider discovered his pursuer, and away went tbe white steed.
“Come, Bees, don’t let the spirit outrun you,” cried Bill, and the noble beaBt strained herself to her utmost and began steadily to gain.
Then the sable arms of the rider were seen to rise and fall in the moonlight, and once or twice Bill caught the keen chirp of a descending lasb.
At the end of the canyon the white steed was not fifty lengths in advance, but suddenly wheeled off to the left.
“ Follow him, Bess,” said Bill, as though addressing a dog, and although the white steed had disappeared from sight, the instinct of the pursuing animal led her hot on her trail into tbe dark forest
Without touching therein Bill allowed Bess to go on her own way, and soon the white steed came in sight again.
Out of the forest upon an opeu plateau went pursuer and pursued, and tben BUI saw he was only tweDty lengths away, and the rider was seen to be lashing his horse mercilessly.
“ Aha, sir Spirit of tbe Canyon, you’ve got a good horse to play ghost with, but you didn’t know Bonny Bees was in this part of the country,’’ and then raising his voice he called out in a ioud tone:
“ Haiti”
But on the Spirit of the Canyon sped.
“Then take the consequences,” muttered Bill, and his pistol flashed as he spoke.
At bis shot the white steed gave a bound into tbe air, staggered forward a few paces, and fell at the very brink of a precipice, overhanging a mountain stream.
Down went his rider, and lay motionless, and springing to tbe ground as he drew up, BUI bent over him.
It was apparently a youth, of eighteen perhaps, with a slender form clad in black, and weariug a belt of arma He seemed dazed by the fall, but soon recovered and looked Bill in the face, while he said quietly:
“ Well, do you intend to hang me, too?”
“ Hang you? Why should 11”
“ You hung Captain Kirk.”
“Not I; I was not on tbe road then, if you mean the road-agent chief the VigUautes strung up.”
“ Yes, I mean Ed Kirk, my husband.”
“ Your husband?” asked BUI, in great surprise.
“Yes, hi> wrote another name than his own to a check, fled to keep out of prison, went from bad to worst and I followed him, for I loved him.
“ To revenge his death, by scaring all who travel these mountains at night, I have been playing ghost; but you are a brave man to follow me.”
“Thank you; I am not so big a fool about spooks and spirits as tbe others, perhaps; but what do you wish to do?”
“I don’t know, and I don’t care; I Uve near here in a cave, and only wish to be let alone.”
“You shall have your wish; but I advite you not to play ghost any more.”
“I won’t; good-night.”
“ Oood-nightI” and BiU mounted Bess and rode on after the stage.
But, pitying tbe woman be did not tell of his adventure, and wben the next night he drove along tbe road, he faUed to9ee the Spirit of the Canyon.
Some few weeks after, however, he wu hailed by a pedestrian, and the slender form of the woman clambered to a seat by his side on the box.

Bill.
•' Ob, ho; Ed made plenty while he lived, for you forget he was Captain Kirk, the road-asent.”
‘•Ah, yes,” assented Bill, and he drove on; Imt at the next station he parted with tbe strange, lonely woman, never to meet her a+fftin.	_
CHAPTER VU
BILL BECOMES AX INDIAN’-FIGHTER.
Prom tho lower Overland r >uio Bill gradually drifted northward, and while still driving stage, bad some serious adventures with Indians who had become very troublesome along tb • whole line of road.
On one occasion a band of sixty red-skins '‘jumped ” the stage just as it bad crossed a small stream, and left the prairie, preparatory to asoending the foot-hill3 to the station, distant some eight miles.
At a glance Bill saw that ho could not make it up the bill, and he wheeled his team of six horses short round and recrossing the stream, dashed out upon tbe open prairie.
The horses were good runners and went like the very wind, and keeping thein on a straight course, he turned and raised bis rifle, and fired at tbe nearest Indian.
Down dropped the red skin, and a second shot sent down a mustang.
But this was only two out of sixty, and Bill knew that bis team could not stand the killing pace at which they were going very much longer, and decided to use strategy.
Making a circuit to the right, as if to avoid a long and deep ravine in tbe prairie, he knew tbe lodfans would head so as to cut him off, and he held on, seeing that they did so, until he got them away from behind him.
Then to the right about went his team, and upon the horses the lash fell, as they headed back for the foot-hills.
The Indians seeing that they were cleverly fooled, at once put for tbe creek at full speed.
But their horses seemed to be fatigued, and only about a dozen drew away from the main lot, and these Bill knew they must break through, so he called out to the passengers to be ready for the charge.
Right on tbe banks of the stream the redskins charged upon the stage, and with his reins under his feet, a revolver in each hand, and yells at his horses, Bill dasbed into the stream.
There were wild yells, splashing of water, a fearful swaying of the stage, snorting of horses, and the rattle of fire-arms, and the coach bad dashed through and was upon the hill-road with the red-slcins behipd, and half-a-dozen of them dead, and as many mustangs, badly wounded, floundering in the water.
But Bill had been twice slightly wounded, one of his horses was shot in the neck, and in the stage, which bad been fairly riddled with ariows, many of which still stuck in it, lay three dead men, passengers, while the other two did not escape scathless.
Back at the still pursuing red-skins Bill opened with his rifle as tbe stage team, nearly tired out, climbed the hill, and thus kept them at bay until a party of mounted men, hearing tbe firing, came out from the station and put them to flight.
This daring gantlet of death, run with a team of six horses and a stage coacb, added greatly to Bill’s already famous name on the border, and caused him to be made captain of a company of drivers, stock • tenders, and Pony Express Riders, that were raised to fight tbe Indians, for, while they were on the warpath the stages had to be laid by, as aU along tbe line the greatest depredations had been committed, Pony Riders killed, and many valuable horses belonging to the Overland Company had been run off.
Jlountiueaod arming his men Bill started
on the trail of the Indians, followed it to the Powder river, then to Crazy Woman’s Pork, a stream that is frozen all winter and no stream at all in the dry buinmer, where it was found that all tbe raiding bands had consolidated.
CHAPTER VIII.
BILL’S RED TRAIL.
When tbe party under Bill’s command discovered that tbe Indian bands had united, almost to a man they were unanimous in their desire to put back, as they did not number but a few over half-arhundred horsemen while it was evident that ttie red-skins numbered over three hundred warriors.	*
But Bill promptly said:
“ Pards, we have come hero to punish the Indians, who have stolen "the stock of the Overland, thus stopping tbe running of coaches and the Pony Riders, and we are going to do it, and recapture our horses, besides giving the reds a lesson that will last them.”
Some argued that they would all .be massacred, and Bill cut this argument short by threatening to kill any man or men, wbo turned- the heads of tbeir horses homeward without his orders.
All knew Bill, and preferred to take their chances against the Indians to certain death at bis hands, and the march was begun once more.
Arriving in sight of the smoke of tbe Indian cauip on Clear Creek, Bill called a bait, to rest his men and horses, and went on a scout alone.
After several hours he returned, ordered his men to mount, to fight only with their revolvers, and follow him.
He had already found, on bis scout, where the corral of horses.was, aud sent a few men to that point, while, with the remainder be charged directly into the Indian camp, the pickets not seeing their foes until they were upon them, and little dreaming they were pursued, as they knew ther<» were no soldiers in the country, and dreaded not an attack from the employes of the Overland.
As the amazed and frightened Indians rushed out of their tepees, they were shot down without mercy, and the fight soon became a perfect slaughter, and a few only escaped in the darkness to the forests and hills, leaving their village in tbe possession of tbe victorious whites, who, besides recapturing all of the stock of the Overland Company, took several hundred Indian ponies, which were safely taken back to the stations, where they became the property of their captors, and were gambled off again and again, until nearly every man of the expedition had been the possessor, at least for a few minutes, of every one of the mustangs.
This successful expedition, in wbich the redskins suffered so fearfully, was called Wild Bill’s Red Trail, and added new laurels to his name, already so famous for deeds of desperate daring.
CHAPTER IX.
A DEATH STRUGGLE.
Shortly after bis red trail raid against the Indians, Bill severed his connection with the Overland Stage Company, and became Brigade Wagon Master of a train of “Prairie Schooners” belonging to Russell, Majors and Waddell, and his line was to be between Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Independence, Missouri.
While on this road Bill m.t with an adventure that was as serious as any he had known in the past, and wbich nearly cost him his life.
It was not with renegade, desperado or redskin that he was to grapple this time, but with a monarch of the mountains, a huge cinuamon bear.
Bill had ridden on ahead of the wagon trail a few miles, and discovered in front of bim on the trail a tremendous bear with her two cubs.
Instead of seeking safety in flight, Mrs. Bruin at one® showed »> maternal solicitude for
her young, and a desire to contest tbe right j way with tbe bold horseman.
Bill knew that the cinnamon bear was eii more dangerous than tbe grizzly, and yet determined to attack that bear and kill it fore the train came along.
He had with him his two revolvers a huge bowie-knife, and felt no dread of tbe i suit, and rode nearer to the animal to ge good shot, when, with a savage growl brute showed her intention to force tbe fig ing.
But his horse, alarmed at her charge i fierce growling, wheeled to fly, when cbed suddenly by BUI, be sprung into tbe air, a falling l>ackward, but for tbe agility of rider, who caught on bis feet, would have i fen upon him.
Unable to remount bis borse, that scramb to his feet and dasbed away, Bill turned meet his savage foe, and firing, struck brute squarely in tbe head, but the bo glanced, and only served to enrage her moi
Bill, however, nothing daunted, Bred second shot, and again hit the brute in ’ head, but, as aU old hunters know, the skuD a cinnamon bear is almost impervious to a 1 let.
This second shot made the bear mad xi fury, and she sprung at her enemy, who fl a third shot that broke the bone of her f( leg, as he had aimed to da
But the bear reared on heT hind’ leg*, I grappled with the brave hunter, who wo not fly, and a-most desperate encounter : lowed, Bill rending another shot into her, t then seizing his bowie, and driving.it with full force of his iron arm into the huge bo of the animal.
But the bear bad not been idle the wfcl for she bad' lacerated his shoulder with fa teeth, and broken his left arm with one blaj of ber unwounded fore paw, whUe tbe clttjfi seamed his broad breast with gashes.
But Bill never wavered, and again aud egf drove the knife heme to tbe hilt, standfc boldly up to the combat, and tbe blood of man and beast reddening tbe earth.
At length a blow from tbe brute knock.-i BIU down, and in an instant she was on tops! him, and his left arm was grasped in ber ted !
“ Chew away, old lady, for this is the «',! that does the work,” shouted Bill, and he ag*| drove his knife to the hilt, and fcrtunat^S this time touched tbe beart, the only. vif? spot, hunters in the Rocky Mountains saj, I J a cinnamon or grizzly bear.
It was Bill’s last stroke, as be fell upon A body of the brute be had slain, fainting frotj loss of blood, and there bis comrades fotaji him when they came up in search of him, htf|| ing hastened on from the fact of his hebji coming back riderless to the train.
One of tbe wagon drivers bad been a pbjtjg dan in early life, and BiU was put on a pallet in one of the vehicles, and this aid dressed his wounds, and he was hauled j| Santa Fe, where an army surgeon took chjfl| of bim.
But it was long months before he was bilj self again, and tbe scars be received in ttt desperate encouuter, he carried to bis gn», with tim, as he did also its remembrance wl painful vividness. _
CHAPTER X.
WINKING TBE TITLE OF "WILD BILL.’’ When BiU got well enough to resume woit he again went on the road witb Messrs. RuwA Majors and Waddell, until tiring of slow titS life, be left that service and went- as Pony 2fj press rider in Western Kansas.	J
Bill’s ride was over a most dangerous i* lonely piece of road, and at Rock Creek nis laying-off station, where the company W established a relay of horses, and put in chwj of them a borderman by the name of Df, Mills, who always bad far tbe Pony Ri<M*A good meal upon bis arrival after his long Tbe station was a log hut of one room, in this they slept, cooked and ate in bad

|her, and In fair weather preferred to rough it
• It bad a door, no window, and in (act waa, I, Western parlanoe, little more than * “ dug-
Iat.”
« Near the cabin were the stables, built of Sr.iut logs, and wbich were secure against an intrance of thieves, without a great deal of difficulty.
U Tbe nearest neighbor to this lonely ranch »as five miles away, where dwelt an old, itinerant parson, who was in the habit of preach-fag wben he oould get a few people together to listen to him.
■ i Then, thirteen miles distant was a place jtaown as the McCandless Ranch, where dwelt Jour brothers of that name, who were noted desperadoes.
■ This quartette of worthies one day, from acme fancied wrong done them by the old par-Mn, arrested him, bound him, and with a lariat #ound his neck, were taking him with them apd-threatening to bang.	\ _
>	j As they passed the relay station Bill happened to be in, while D < Mills, his comrade, jSkd gone up the creek fishing.
-Tseeing the old man in trouble it excited Bill’s grmpathy, and he told tbe McCandless boys B release him; but they not only refused, but Ibid Bill they would treat him worse than that tftme day.
96 “When you want me you’ll find me,” retorted Bill, and the quartette rode on with their prisoner.
i Not liking the threat of tbe gang, and knowing they wanted to get the horses, if they oould, Bill went into tbe cabin, and looked over Us weapons, after which he locked up the stock and awaited the return of the party who had threatened him.
i j;Doc Mills remained absent all the morning, and it was in tbe afternoon that Bill spied the McCandless quartette, accompanied by six sore men as a reinforcement, u Finding the stable looked, they called to Bill Ic unlock it, and received a reply not at all complimentary to them, and they at once set bo work to break in the door. y Bill warned them off, under pain of death; but, unheeding bim, they raised a huge log, tarried it with great foroe against the door of the log cabin, and in it was smashed.
Bill had stepped to the back of the dug-out, *ith a table before him, upon which lay his resolvers and bowie-knife, while iu his hand he held a Mississippi yager, ready to fire.
The elder McCandless, the leader, sprung into tbe cabin first, a revolver in his hand, and fell dead on the threshold
>	Dropping the yager, BiU seized his revolvers, and before his assailants could reach him laid three more of them dead before him.
Tbe remaining six now rushed en masse upon him, and instantly the fiercest fight of a single •tan against overwhelming numbers on record
$ BUI fired with a revolver in one hand, and «ut and slashed with his bowie-knife in the fcther, while the gang were equally as active, Jet, having but one person to work upon, tbeir shots and cute were not as effective, i At one time BUI waB down, and one of the McCandless boys sprung on him to finish him, when be got a bullet in his brain, and the desperate Pony Eider was again upon his feet, do-lng tearful work with his terrible knife, n Four men of the ten now remained, and *wo of these being badly wounded, they beat a hasty retreat from before the fearful being (they had roused in fury, and he tottering from loss of blood, but game to Ihe bitter end. followed them, and shot one as be mounted ibis ihoree, and, with a rifle wrested from Doc Milder. who just then came up, gave another a (death wound, for he died after reaching the Jhamlet of Manhattan, some miles distant.
1 Aa his foes dasbed away BiU sunk unconscious upon tbe ground, Just as the Westera-taund stage rolled up filled with passengers, i among whom fortunately was an army but-Keon, that at oooe set to work to try and save
the border hero, while the others gazed around them with horror upon the blood-stained ground and sickening scene, for six men lay dead in tbe cabin aud one a short distance away outside of the door.
It was a long time ere Bill was resuscitated, and no wonder, for the surgeon found upon him a fracture of the frontal bone of the skull, three fearful cuts in his broad chest, a knife through his left arm, four buUet wounds in his body, two in the lower part of his right leg, a gash in his cheek, and several cuts in bis scalp, and other wounds which he called scratches.
For this desperate affray, in which one man whipped ten desperadoes, killing eight of them, the title of “ Wild BUI ” was bestowed upon tbe famous borderman, who was unfitted for service for twelve long months. But few other men could have survived such fearful injuries-as he received, or come out of an encounter so deadly.	_
CHAPTER £1.
TUB PONT EXPRESS RIDER’S RESCUE.
While WUd BUI, as he is now known to the reader, was riding Pony Express, he bad another fearful encounter against desperate odds, which I may as well make knowu here.
A stock-tender whom wild Bill was very much attached to, had been placed iu charge of one of the most isolated stations on the road, and seeing his soUtude the Pony Rider said to him:
“ Dick, you ought to get married, and then you would have company in your lonely-home.”
“ I'd do it in a minute, Bill, if I could get off duty to go after a girl I am engaged to,” declared the stock-tender.
“ Ohl I’ll arrange that for you,” was Bill's reply as he bounded upon the back of a fresh horse and dasbed away.
And arrange it he did, for shortly after an “extra” came to the relay station to take charge for a week or two, while Dick Talbot went after bis wife.
And back to the solitude of the prairie came the young wife with her husband, and they made themselves as comfortable as tbe circumstances would admit of in that far-away border cabin home.
The maiden whom Dick tbe stock-tender had married, was a pretty, auburn-liaired girl of eighteen, and the was very glad to prepare a meal for Wild Bill, the handsome Pony Express Rider, who each day paid their humble home such a flying visit, as he sped like the wind upon bis run of seventy-five miles.
When approaching the station, to warn the stock-tender to have a fresh horse ready, it was the custom of tbe Pony Riders to play a few notes on the bugle, while flying along at fuU speed.
One day, as Wild BiU neared the station, he put the small bugle he wore to his lips, and blew a few ringing notes.
But upon dashing up to the door he saw no horse awaiting him, and four strange animals saddled and bridled, and waiting bitched not far away. —
At the same time he heard a cry from within the cabin, in the voice of the stock-tender’s wife:
“Help! Bill! Help: for the love of God 1”
Wild Bill was no man to tarry when a woman caUed for help, and springing from his horse and drawing a revolver he dashed toward the cabin, at the door of which lay the body of the stock-tender, and with a bullet wound in bis head.
Just then a man was coming out, and seeing Wild BUI fired upon him aud missed him, whUe the next minute he feU under the return fire.
Springing over tbe dead bodies of the stock-tender, and man he had just slain, Bill sprung into the house, to find tbe young bride struggling in tbe grasp of two men, who were trying to stop her cries, and to do which, one had raised his revolver to strike ber in the head.
when a 6bot broke his arm, and he, with his comrade, and another villain that, came out of an adjoining room, loaded down.Vrftb booty, rushed upon the daring man who had come to the woman's rescue.
There was a rapid exchange! of shots, Wild Bill firing with lightning rapidity; and dropping two of the men, while the third, the one be hod before wounded in the arm, rusbed for the door.
Wild Bill sprung after him, but with a cry the frightened woman threw, her arms arouud bim and began to shriek in terror, and in pity of her sorrow, sufferings, and fright, Tie remained to soothe her, and one of the five escaped with his life.
Wild BUI remained with the poor young bride-widow until the stage came along, aud then mounting a fresh horse dashed on hi. way, and arrived at the end of his long ride just on time, though he made his horses suffer to do it
This exploit, which got at onoe noised about tbe frontier, aud along the overland trails, added stUl more to the name of Wild BUI, and caused him to be greatly feared by aU the desperadoes in that part of the country, for they looked upon him as bearing a charmed life.'
CHAPTER XIL WILD bill’s duel with a q ambler.
Shortly after his last fierce combat, when he went to the rescue of the wife of the stock-tender, Wild Bill gave up Pony Express Riding, to take cbargo of a Government wagon train lioUnd to Springfield with supplies for the United States Army, for the civil war in America, had just begun.
Upon tbis trip Buffalo BUI, then a youth in years, accompanied him as assistant wagon-master, and they ran the train into Springfield in safety, and then tbe two BUls,'both splendid specimens of border heroes, went to St. Louis together, where they lost all tbeir money bettirg on a horse-race.
This financial “bu’st up” caused Buffalo Bill to return to Kansas, whUe WUd BUI went to the military head quarters in St. Louis, where he readily secured a position as Government Scout, and was sent to Springfield.
It was not long before he rendered the Government most valuable service, in tbe capacity of a sceut, as- be frequently boldly entered the Confederate lines as a spy, and obtained information he could not have gotten otherwise.
Upon his return from one of these bold ventures one night, WUd BiU was paid cff by the Government, and going to a gambling salcon, was inveigled into a game of cards with a desperate character.
Wild Bill won the game, and a watch from his adversary, which the latter refused to give up.
BiU demanded it, and said he had to report at nine o’clock the following morning at mUi tary bead-quarters, and intended carrying tba watch he had won.
His adversary, whose name was Dave Trill, said he had to report at the same time, and would himself carry the watch.
This was equivalent to a challmge to a street duel, and BiU said no more; but promptly the next morning he was on the square, and soon after Dave Tritt appeared.
All knowing of tbe intended meeting bail attended, and, as £ht? two men boldly advanc* *1 toward each other ilie crowd fell back to a position of safety.
Dave Tritt first drew bis revolver, and carr\ -ing it in his bund advanced at a rapid walk, the other hand being upon the cbain to which the watch was attached.
As WUd BiU advanced, calm and dignified, not yet having drawn his revolver, Tritt suddenly raised his weapon and fired, missing Bill, but only by an inch.
WUd BUI, as quick as a flash of light^ then drew his weapon and throwing forward bis band, pulled the trigger.
His aim. as usual, was true and deadly, for

the ballet, struck Dave Tritt squarely in the forehead, and he dropped dead.
Wild BIU walked coolly up to him, took the watoh from his pocket, placed it in his own, and going over to where a crowd of Tritt’s friends stood, greatly excited, said in his quiet way:
“ Gentlemen, do any of you desire to take up this quarrel where Mr. Tritt has left it off!”
Not a soul answered, and Wild Bill then walked over to. the military head-quarters and reported for duty, as though nothing bad occurred to mar his morning’s enjoyment.
CHAPTER XUL
WILD BILL AS A SPY.
Arm a short stay at army hoad-quarters, Wild Bill rode away one morning bound on a most perilous mission, wbich was ho more or lees than to join the Confederate forces, as a pretended volunteer, and act as a spy.
He was joined on the way by another Union scout, an . old friend of Bill’s, and a gallant fellow, and the two comrades entered the lines atvgtven point, and boldly enlisted as soldiers In the army of General Price, who was then sperating against General Curtis with a Federal force.
By constant watchfulness and investigation, Wild Bill and Trickett, his spy companion, gained most valuable information regarding' the movements of the Confederates, and finding that it was important to communicate at once wtth General Curtis, they looked about for a means of escape Into the Union lines.
But the two armies were facing each other in line of battle, and the heavy guns were firing, and by no means, was it an easy task to gain the Union forces.
But suddenly Wild Bill, who had juined tbe cavalry, said to his comrade:
“Trickett, we must make a break now or never! You have a copy of my dispatches, so let us start and make a bold ride lor it, and one of us will get through."
Trickptt, seemed to shrink from the fearful risk; but Wild Bill was determined, and the two spies, well mounted, started along the lines, as if carrying dispatches, and then suddenly wheeled and bounded their horses over the breastworks and headed straight for the Unipn anny.
Ac first tbe Confederates seemed not to understand what was their intention; but au officer called out:
“ They are. deserters, escaping t<> the Union lines! Fire on tbem!”
Volleys of pistol-shots were then turned upon them, and then followed a discharge of musketry.
At the same time a company of cavalry boldly dasbed in pursuit, and the wild ride commenced.
Seeing that the two horsemen 'iu advance were fugitives, the Federals opened a hot fire upon the Confederates, who turned their carbines upon WUd Bill and Trickett, and the latter was seen to throw up his arms and wave them wildly in tbe air.
Wild Bill immediately dashed up to his side and endeavored to support him in tbe saddle; but he could not do so, and Trickett fell from his horse, and once more the daring prairieman sped on, and his splendid animal cleared a wide ditch with a mighty bound.
Bnt it was the last effort of the gallant steed, for another volley from the Confederate carbines, and be fell dead, hurling his rider to the ground.
In an instant Wild BUI was upon his feet and flying with the speed of a drer toward the Union lines, just as a squadron of cavalry dashed out to succor him.
Instaptly then WJId BiU halted, wheeled and threw forward his deadly revolver, leveling it at a Confederate officer who was far in advance of his men.
With the report the officer fell forward on the neck of his horse, and the animal shying one side, he dropped to the ground, but mi dead ere he touched it.
The next moment Wild BiU was safe in the Federal Unes, and bis secret information was given to General Curtis; but that night, at tbe risk of his own life, he crept back to tbe spot where Trickett bad fallen and brought bis body into camp and buried it on the side of a small
CHAPTER XIV.
SENTENCED TO DEATH.
Having met with »ucb decided success, even at such fearful personal risks, in his former expedition as a spy, the general to whose command WiU Bill was attached suggested another trip Into the Confederate lines.
WiU BiU consented, though well knowing his danger, as on the former occasion he had become pretty weU known to the Confederates during his stay of several weeks; but he determined to go in disguise, and accordingly watched his opportunity. He received a backwoods jeans suit, much the worse for wear, a« antiquated jackass and revolutionary musket from an old negro, and thus equipped and mounted, he rode boldly for the lines of the Southern army.
He was received as just what he represented himself, a backwoodsman of the greenest kind, and easily persuaded to enlist, the Confederate soldiers having a great deal of amusement over his supposed verdancy.
But there was one among the Southerners who knew Bill well, and his keen eyes had detected something famUiar under the disguise of the protended backwoodsman, and he determined to keep an eye on him, for he had witnessed the daring escape of tbe spy on tbe former occasion of bis coming into the lines.
At length he felt convinced of his man, informed an officer, and all of a sudden a score of guns covered the spy, and he was told to surrender, for he was known.
Wild BUI very calmly submitted, for it would be instant death to do otherwise, and he was at once bound securely and imprisoned untU a court-martial tried him as a spy.
There was ample evidence to convict bim, once the disguise was off, for many recognized him, and the sentence of death by hanging was passed upon bim.
Wild BiU was perfectly cool throughout, for his was a nature that never gave up hope while life lasted, and he set about planning an escape to the Union lines, which he knew were not far away.
The night before the day appointed for his execution was one of fearful storm, and tbe sentinel guarding Wild BUI shrunk under the eaves of tbe log cabin in which the prisoner was confined to shelter himself from the wind and rain.
BiU was within the Uttle hut, hit bands tied tightly behind him and watching with a hawk's eye the movements of tbe sentinel.
Dnring the day he had, in scanning the prison, noticed an old case-knife in a chink in the logs, and now he arose, turned his back, and grasped it.
Feeling around in the darkness he at last fcund a knot-hole in a log, and into this pushed the handle of the knife and began to slowly rub the stout cords that bound him against the blade.
Tbe blade was dull, the ropes hard, and it was slow work; but at last the friction severed them, and Wild Bill felt his bands were free.
The sentinel still shrunk back under the projecting roof, and, looking out through tbe crevices, Bill saw that he was near the door, and called to bim to come in and give him a drink of water.
Lazily the sentinel obeyed, for the door was fastened on the outside, and as he stepped with • in his throat was seized in a gripe of iron, ai.d a fierce struggle ensued.
Unable to cry out with tbe gripe of steel upon his tbroat, the sentinel fought with desperation; but Wild Bill was the more powerful of the two, and at last drove the case-knife, which bad so well served bim before, deep into tbe heart of his foe,
That ended the struggle, and taking the
man’s overcoat, bat and musket, WUd BUtl once left the Confederate camp, and in M darkness and storm made good his eeoap* ■ tbe Union lines.
CHAPTER XV.
A SIOUX CHIEI-’S TREACHERY. _ After tbe most arduous service in tbe arJ
Wild BiU was ordered to go and investigated truth of a report, brought in to General C tis, by Conquering Bear, a Sioux chief, to effect that a large force of Choctaw and Cbc kee Indians were preparing to have a geci massacre of the whites in eastern Kansas.
“I’ll go back with Conquering Bear, g eral, and see whether he lies like a book-ag* or teUs the truth, and if I do not report wit a week write my obituary," said Wild Bill.
“ FU send what men yon need with v Bill.”	^
“ No, general, Bear and myself will go pi on this trip, and if he deceives me, his hair mino gets lifted.”
That night Wild BUI and the Indian el started together, and first went to the Si camp, where they remained a short time, then, as darkness was coming on, they parted for the camj) of the Cherokee and Cl taw Indians, which Conquering Bear had i were preparing for a general massacre.
BUI desired to find their camps, see how land lay. and then return with what imp sions he hail formed, so that General Co could take e'K-accurdingly.
Suddenly, h< tbe chief and WUd BiU «■ riding along in the darkness, Conquering J gave a wild war-whoop, and instantly dai into the forest, just as a score of Choctaws i rounded the scout.
In an instant Bill saw how he had h trapped by the wily Sioux; but he did not i to consider just then, and at once set hist revolvers going like a talking machine. £ His mare, Black Nell, which he had e^i tured from a bushwhacker whom he I killed, bounded forward at the word, and tbe darkness and confusion, for they could Kg tell friend from foe, the scout managed tot ] cape, bis usual good fortune not deserting hi and the Indians were compeUed to give up I pursuit, besides mourning the loss of ttat! of their warriors kiUed, while tbeir foe « uninjured.
Bill promptly returned to General Cud and reported tbe treachery of tbe Sioux, « asked for a leave for a week or two, wbfc was readily granted.
Haring made his arrangements BiU start out on his traU of vengeance, and understsi ing the Sioux tongue gained tbe confidsa of a young warrior, who, for a considerate agreed to arrange a meeting between Cl quering Bear and the Ecout, who was of coco not to be known to tbe chief.
Expecting to meet a trader, as tbe want bad so told bim, Conquering Bear went to 4 appointed spot, accompanied by his red ocs panion, when suddenly they were confronts by WUd BUI who held tbe drop on the ctiM while be smiled pleasantly and said:
“ I won't detain you long, Conquering BM but yon owe me a little debt I am goinf I collect just here.
“You can pay it with either one of my I volvers, which I will lend you, or your kri, and we’ll go to work at once."
Tbe Indian at once saw that he was entrapped and bent a scowling look upon young warrior, who aald:
“Conquering Bear great chief; me thoaft be want white trailer scalp.”
“ He doubtless does, only he wanted to trfi it in his own treacherous way; well, Bed wbich shaU it be, knife or revolver?” Conquering Bear chose the knife, and ' Bill at once laid aside his revolvers.
The Indian tben advanced and Wild Bi met him with bis blade and the fight leg*, with fearful ferocity.	. J
Conquering Beer was a larger man tttij BiU, although the latter was six feet two

Adventures of Wild BilL
<jb«6, and weighed orer two hundred pound*, and consequently they were well matched.
It wa* ft bot, savage fight, and tbe irou bandi of each held his blade »o firmly against the other’s, that it was impossible to get a thrust home, while their left bands were holding tbe throat of eaoh other with the tenacity of a bull-dog.
Now and then a sudden change would be made, and tben wounds of a slight nature would be received by each.
But at last WUd BU), tiring of tbe fight and wishing to end it. left his breast unguarded purposely, and the Indian wa* quick to take advantage, and made a fierce thrust, which the scout caught on bis arm, tbe blade burying itself in the flesh.
With bis knife thus sheathed the Indian was at the mercy of WUd Bill, who drove his own keen blade deep down into tbe neck of his adversary, wbo, with a wild death-cry sunk upon the blood-stained ground.
As Bill bent over his foe to take his scalp, he suddenly beheld the young warrior seize his belt of arms and beard tbe words:
“ Me want big white chief now; me got Sim.”
•‘I guess you can have me, Injun; what shall I do!” quietly said WUd Bill, as he saw his own revolvers pointed directly at him.
“ Go to 8ioux camp, and me be great chief,” was the reply.
“ You’ll never get there in good health, redskin," muttered Wild BUI, as he promptly turned and set off in the direction ef the camp.
But ere they had gone ten paces the young 1 warrior lowered his revolver, and quicker than a flash Wild BiU wheeled and fired with a i Derringer he carried in his hunting shirt, and his captor dropped, a bullet through his heart.
Taking his scalp,_and placing it with that of Conquering Bear, Wild Bill quickly bound up his wounds as well as he could, aud mounting Black Nell rode for the nearest town as rapidly i as his mare oould go and was soon in tbe care of a surgeon, and the report of his duel with Conquering Bear, and his revenge for his treachery, spread like wildfire, and it soon became known that some of the scout’s enemies had paid the chief to put him to death.
CHAPTER XVI.
WIU) BILL’S INDIAN SWXKTHEABT.
Among tbe Siouxs there was a young chief whom WUd Bill hadouce befriended, and who was an intelUgent Indian and greatly attached to the scout.
Meeting him soon after the duel with Conquering Bear, this young chief, whom BiU called Captain Joe, told his pale-face friend that there was splendid trapping upon the Niobrara river and the adjacent streams, and although the Sioux hunting-grounds were not far away, and he had only lately killed one of tbeir chiefs, be determined to go np there and trap for the season, for pelts were prime, and bringing a large price in the market.
Captain Joe had a half sister, for his mother had married a white hunter after tbe death of her Indian husband, who was a great chief, a maiden of strange beauty and refinement, for her father had taught ber much, and after V	htoBelf in a on the
traPB- the Indian and his sister paid him a visit one day.
At first sight of the scout the dusky maiden loved him, and Wild bill was struck with her
W8y“' Md tb«y b^-arae great friends, and every few days she would go with her brother to the Ion!; £^d
E T T ,0Sd’ “d the °f her own hands, for she made him a hunting-shirt and
1)6118 and other things which she forced him to accept.
At last, as spring drew near, WUd BiU bade his two Indian friends farewell, and a sad part ng it wa* for poor Maree the Indian maHeu^ and loading several Indian ponies pelt8> he 861 ont for Missouri. Feeling that the was deserted by Wild BUI
whom she felt did not love her, though he had ever treated ber most kindly, tbe red-skin maiden married a handsome young Indian trader from St. Louis and went with him to St Louis to lire.
As U1 fortune would have It Maree met WUd Bill in the streets of St Louis one day, and all of ber love for bim returning, she seemed to fairly hate her husband, who became jealous of her, punished her severely in a fit of rage, and set out to kUl the scout.
But Wild Bill had gone off suddenly with a western bound train, not to return for some time, and tbe husband had to be content to nurse his jealous rage untU the scout should get back.
Remembering how her hURband had treated ber, and realiy without cause, loving WUd Bill more desperately than ever, and fearing that she would be killed by ber jealous lord and master, Maree determined upon revenge against the man she had married, and to save the Ufe of the one she loved so madly.
Watching her opportunity she put poison in her husband’s food, and when she saw that it proved fatal, she fled from St Louis back to ber people, hoping Wild Bill would seek her there.
But in thi3 she was mistaken, and after waiting in vain for his coming for one whole year, she went out to the forest, tought a lonely spot on the banks of a small stream, dug her own grave with the utmost coolhess, and then laying down in it took ber own life by driving a knife, wbich BiU bad given ber into her heart' She had asked some Indian maidens to seek her there at sunset, and there, to their horror, they found her dead, and u|x>n her bosom a letter which was addressed to the scout Her mourning brother, Captain Joe, gave the letter himself to Wild Bill, who read it with deep emotion, consigned it to tbe flames, and never made its contents known to any human being.
CHAPTER XVII.
A FIVE-HANDED DUEL.
Going up into Nebraska on a trapping excursion, Wild Bill one day in Jefferson county, stopped at a wayside tavern, the resort of the few wayfarers that traveled that wild region, and cowboys who lived on the cattle-ranches in tbe vicinity.
In tbe saloon of the tavern as he entered, were a score of half-drunken men, some of whom were desperadoes of tbe worst type, and only longing for an excuse to get up a flgbt.
They did not know WUd BUI by sight, though there was not one among them who had not heard of his wonderful exploits. But he was a stranger, and that was sufficient for a row, and the buUy of the buUies at once fastened bis eyes upon bim, and as the scout called for a drink, stepped up and said:
*• No stranger, pard, comes in these p.irts that don’t treat the gang aU round.”
“I was just about to ask you aU to join me: but since you demand it, 111 see you damned first,” was the cool reply, and pouring out his Uquor BiU raised the glass to bis lips, when the desperado promptly knocked it from bis hand.
Instantly Bill sent bis right fist outward, and over and over the bully roUed as though a mule had kicked him.
This was the casus belli at once, and the three friends of the desperado instantly drew their revolvers; but Rome of tbe herders wishing to see fair play, called out:
“Hold on, pards! fourag’fn one hain’t Nebraska style.”
“ I don’t mind the four, if they come single-handed,” was Bill’s quiet response.
“No, we fights four at a time, stranger pard, so you’ve got to light out and show yourself a coward, or take us in a bunch,” said one.
“ Very well, only let us have a square deal: the bartender give tbe word, and you four gents stand in a row ten feet apart, and about fifteen paces from me.”
This bold proposition was Ustened to with
amasement and delight by the spectators, and all adjourned outside.
Then WUd Bill insisted that the four dee peradoes should put aside aU weapons except the or e each was to use, and that only one afcot should be allowed in that, and he would carry but four in his revolver.
The men took their stands, the crowd retreated to one side, and the umpire bartender gave the word:
“ One, two, three, fire!"
At tbe word two pistols flashed, and Bill dropped ' the man on the left, while be received a shot in the light arm, that knocked the revolver from his band, and a second fhot passed over his head us he stooped for it
Seizing it in bis left band, and he was equal ly as dead a shot with that, he hastily shot the man on the left, and then, although struck by a buUet in the leg, never missed bis unerring aim, and brought down his other two foes.
Three of the men were dead, shot through tbe brain, and the fourth had his jaw broken and is still Uving.
As for Wild Bill he was at once a hero, and his wounds were dressed with rude kindness; but be did not like tbe neighborhood, and as soon as be was able iroonted Black Nell one night and set out for Kansas City, where the story of his duel with the four desj^eradoes had already preceded him.
But bis wound in tbe arm reopened, and he was confined to his room for a couple of months, when be joined General Primrose in his"march against Black Kettle, a Cheyenne chief that had lately been committing atrocious barbarities in Western Kaunas.
On the same expedition, by a different line of march, Geueral Carr went, and Buffalo Bill was his chief of scouts, while WUd Bill acted in tbe same capacity for General Primrose, and none doubted but that, with two such heroes, the Cheyennes would be trailed to tbe bitter end	__
CHAPTER XVIII.
SAVED BY BUFFALO BILL.
After a long trail after tbe Cheyennes, the two commands of Generals Carr and Primrose met and were consolidated, and Buffalo BUI was made chief of scouts for tbe entire command, with WUd BUI as. second chief under bim. and soon after the red-skins were come up with on the Wachita river, in the Indian Territory.
Black Kettle had encamped in a strong posi -tion near the Antelope HUls, and had fortified his vUIage so thoroughly that Buffalo Bill, who went on a scout alone, returned and stated that it would take desperate fighting to dislodge bim.
He bad a large force under him, among them being bands of young bucks from tbe Arapa-boes and Kiowas, who bad joined tbeir fortunes with the great Indian general, having full confidence in his abilities to outwit and defeat their white enemies.
The battle began by an attack both in the front and rear, and unexpecting this maneuver, the red-skins were driven from tbeir outer lines, and being rapidly foUowed by the soldiers, were pressed back at all points, and the fight became one of great fierceness.
But tbe Indians were stubborn, and several times checked the gallant chargeof the cavalry, until presently Wild BUI and Buffalo Bill dashed up with their scouts and took the Indians’ position and beat them back.
Rushing to the spot to rally his flying warriors, Black Kettle was spied by Wild Bill, who at once dashed forward to his side.
The red chief and scout were both mounted, and having emptied bis revolvers. Wild Bill seized Black Kettle by the throat, and in spite of his savage resistance, drove his knife to his heart, and then tore the scalp lock from hU head, in the very midst of his warriors.
But Wild Bill was wounded in the thigh with a 6pear, by tbe chief, and reeled in his saddle, and would have faUen, or been kUled by tha warriors pressing around him hot for his life
Adventures of Wild BilL
and scalp, when, seeing tbe danger of his old friend, Buffalo Bill, with bis ringing war-cries, and a revolver in each band, spurred forward, opened a lane'through tbe Indian ponies, and retched tbe side of Wild BiU.
A tew rapid shots, a shout to tbeir horses, and tbe two scouts dasbed out from among tbeir foes, and were greeted by wild cheers from tbe soldiers und tbe scouts, wbo bad seen tbeir dan cor arid yet ben unable to aid them.
Wild BiU was found to be seriously wounded, tbe spear-bead having been poisoned, and he was taken back to camp, while the soldiers, pressing on, gained a complete victory, few of tbe warriors escaping, and the village of Black Kettle and the squaws and chUdren falling into tbe bands of General Carr.
As his wound, and those be bad received in bis five-banded duel, and with Conquering Bear, gave bim much trouble. Wild Bill determined to once more go to bis boyhood’s home, from which be had been absent nearly fifteen years, and there be found a warm welcome from bis family, to the hero of a hundred fights, who had beguu bis remarkable career by entrapping wolves on tbe banks of the Vermilion Creek when but a Uttle boy.
CHAPTER XIX
DOING TBS COUNTRY A SERVICE.
Whin WUd Bill fully recovered from his wound8, he went on a visit to Chicago, where, being dressed in buckskin, he was one night set upon in a billiard saloon by a party of roughs, who wished to try his pluck, and with his fists alone be soon showed tbe gang that they bad waked up the wrong passenger.
Not liking city life BiU returned once more to the border, and because be aided in the capture, at tbe request of a constable, of a desperado by the name of Strawban, he was threatened with death by that personage.
BUI little dreaded the threap but hearing that tjtrawhan had been released from jail, kept bis eyes open for him, and one night saw him quietly enter a saloon where he was standing at the bar with a party of friends.
A glance showed Bill that his enemy meant mischief, and without showing that he knew of bis existence he kept hU eye upon him.
Tbe man got a position behind Wild BUI, and was drawing bis revolver to kill him, when with tbe rapidity of a flash of light the scout bad bis revolver out and Btrawban was a corpse.
Soon after a desperado of tbe worst kind, by tbe name of Mulloy, started on a rampage through Hayes City, ran off tbe officers who tried to arrest him, and just “ took ” the town, and WUd BUI was appealed to to calm him.
BiU went up to the rum-maddened man and said:
“MuUoy, come with me.”
“ Guess not; whUe I hold these trumps you don’t win,” and tbe desperado held'up his revolvers, covering Bill’s head and heart.
Wild BUI never flinched, but said calmly, as though addressing some one behind Mulloy:
“Boys, don’t kiU him.”
Instantly Mulloy glanced quickly over his shoulder, and it was his last act on earth, as BiU sent a bullet from bis Derringer through his brain, and the citizens congratulated tbe scout on bis fine work, thanked him for doing the country a service, aud at once unanimously elected him to the position of marshal of Hayee City.
CHAPTER XX.
A FIGHT WITH SOLDIERS.
As WUd BiU was considered the very personification of reckless courage, the citizens of Hayes City were more than delighted iu electing him marshal of their town, and looked forward to a sudden improvement in the tone of many of its desperadoes, and from the way he bad begun with the hard characters, there was every reason to believe that their expectations would be fuUy realised.
One mile from Hayes City was Fort Hayes, where General Sheridan bad his head-quarters,
and here were congregated a number of soldiers, wbo soon took a dislike to the new marshal, as he did not allow them to “ run tbe town ” wben they came into it.
Among the soldiers who bated WUd Bill, and had sworn to get even with him, was a huge sergeant some six feet four inches in bight, weighing two hundred and thirty pounds, and the best man in bis regiment in a fight.
One day the sergeant came into Hayes City bent on trouble, and resorted to tbe saloon of Paddy Welsh, a well-known character, and, with tbe score of soldiers who had accompanied him, began to get drunk.
As he continued drinking the sergeant got worse and worse, dnd soon began to smash furniture, knock citizens down, and rampage generally.
But WUd BiU in bis capacity as City Marshal arrived on the scene and quietly remonstrated with tbe “military terror,” as be was called.
The response was:
“ What’s yer weight, Long Hair?”
“ Enough to handle you, sir, if you render it necessary,” was the cool response.
“ Then I’ll make it necessary and see,” said the sergeant, and he made a lick at BUI, which the latter warded off, and then followed up with a blow tbat sent the sergeant to the floor.
Maddened with rage, he sprung to his feet and again feU, from a terrific blow that met him squarely in the face.
Again he arose, to again get felled, and then over a dozen soldiers, at tbe sight of their sergeant being whipped, rushed upon Bill.
Loudly he warned them off, but on they came, and the next instant the fight began in all its fury.
Pistols were drawn and used, bUliard cues were snapped in twain and made to act as clubs, and knives were slashing about; but in tbe fierce melee, Wild BiU shot straight bome where he aimed, and three soldiers feU dead, and three more sunk in their tracks severely wounded, while seven times wounded himself, Wild Bill retreated to Smoky river near by and swam across.
Here he hid in a thicket, and, though suffering severely from his wounds, wbich he bandaged as well as he could, remained for two days in a freezing atmosphere, and tben managed to crawl to tbe ranch of a friend living half-a-dozen miles from Hayes City.
From this friend, Ben WUliams by name, Wild Bill learned that he had been considered drowned in tbe river; but as this was uncertain, General Sheridan, wbo had heard only the soldiers’ side of the story, had issued an order to take him dead or alive.
It was a long time before EUl’s wounds healed, and then, as he knew he would only have trouble with the military, which he was anxious to avoid, he weut to the RepubUcan river, upon a novel expedition, the motive of which wUl be given in tbe foUowing chapter.
CHAPTER XXI.
A NOVEL VBNTCRE.
The motive that curried Wild BUI to the Republican was, as I have said, a novel one, for it was to capture a few buffaloes, with wbich he intended to proceed to Niagara Falls; where, with Comanche Indians to aid bim, he was to give a wUd style of entertainment to tbe public, which be thought would pay largely for the amusement offered them.
With three assistants BiU went on his buffalo-hunt, and found a large herd upon Beaver Creek, and at once laid his plans to capture the six bulls he desired
Though an expert buffalo killer, he had never taken any of these animals aUve, and his plan to do so was a strange one.
Mounted well, armed with bis rifle and pistols and a number of lassoes, h*» dashed into the herd, and was soon in tbeir very midst, as they swept at fuU speed over th ■ prairie.
Finding that his horse did not work well, BUI boldly deserted him for the back of a huge
bull, that went snorting and plunging on wM rage and fright
His assistants now became alarmed for h safety, and began to dash in among tbe be« and try to torn them, so as to separate tbe oq BiU rode from tbe others; but he shouted: j
‘1 Keep off, all of you, and I’ll lasso tbe wbotl dumed herd.”
From bis seat on tbe buU’s back be boo threw bis stout lariats and managed to secui firmly five more of the herd, and all larg, shaggy brutes.
With their horns entangled in the laseotq and then made fast to tbe bull be bestrode, ti captured buffaloes were now forced to dro back from the herd, which swept on, leavift WUd BiU and his captives behind.
His assistants tben came up with bis borse and the six buffaloes were more firmly m cured with lariats, and hoppled, and th« driven, with great difficult}-, however, t OgaUala, and from thence taken by tbe XTnia Pacific to Omaha, where they were to awai the coming of Wild Bill, wbo bad gone afte the rest of his menagerie, the Comanche In dians.
In a few weeks he returned with four wa* ri-irs, a large bear and huge monkey, tbe latte two animals being pets of tbe braves, and tb entire party set out Tor Niagara.
A place was secured to keep tbe Indians an< buffaloes until the day advertised for tbe chase and then they were turned loose in a long in closure, which was surrounded by *n immenM crowd to witness U»e fun.
At a signal the Comanches not only started; in pursuit, but a number of gentlemen wbo were visiting the falls, and innumerable doge, and it became a lively aud interesting sight
But the crowd, left to contribute or not, at they pleased, did not come within many hundred dollars of making up expenses, and bil’t-stared BiU in the face, until some mischievct* fellow unmuzzled the bear and turned bim and tbe monkey loose, and the very Old Nick was to pay.
To sum up all, the bear, the monkey and tbe > buffaloes were sold, and the showman and hie Comanches started for Kansas, and a wiser and a sadder man after his unfortunate experience, WUd BUI went to Abilene, where he was at once elected marshal.
CHAPTER XXIL
KILLING A FRIEND.
Wild Bill had seen bard enough service as marshal of Hayes City, but Abilene he fonnd that the former place was a paradise to it
Among the noted characters of Abilene was a gentleman of the name of Cole, wbo, a good enough fellow when sober, was a perfect devU wben he got drunk, and was guilty of all kinds of acts of mischief and brutality.
One day, accompanied by a pard, wbo was also a good fellow when not diinkiug, Cole started up the street on one of bis rampages, and WUd Bill, the marshal, and bis deputy, McWilliams, and also his intimate friend, started to arrest them.	W
To save bloodshed. Mr Williams, knowing well tbe character of the iwo men, approached' Cole and begged bim to st,b:uit quietly, aud a: burst of anger being tbe response, WUd BUI drew his revolver and demanded his surrender.
Cole’s reply was an instant shot at BUI, and McWUliams catching his arm, tbe buUet missed its mark, and before the fire could be returned: be turned tbe deputy suddenly around before' him.
Just at tbat moment WUd BUl’s finger, touched the trigger, and his buUet pierced tbe heart of bis friend and deputy marshal, lulling bim instantly.
But not losing his presence of mind at this, he again fired at Cole, who just then leveled his revolver a second time at him, and tbe tall plowed through his brain.
But the fight did not here end, as Cole’s friend shot al Wild BUI, and with such perfect aim that his bullet grazed the scalp: but it was bis last shot, for Wil Billd opened on bim al-

In a fight at Abilene with some herders, portly after the affair in wbich be bad killed bis friend McWilliams, Wild Bill seriously injured one man wbo, while rolling upon his bed Iu suffering, swore to have his life.
^ After months of illness he recovered, and ftben set about to keep his oatb, by getting Kround bim a band of desperadoes and offering jthern tbe reward of five thousand dollars for tbe heart or scalp of Wild Bill
There were many desperate men who longed win this reward, and accordingly eight of tbe band undertook the job, determined to jwin.
. Their purpose was to catch Bill when all were together, for they dared not meet him jrhen they were alone, and then attack bim en
:j But they got drunk, one half-way divulged ,tha plot, and it reached Bill’s ears, and they net on a railroad train, as they learned he was £oing to Topeka.
Finding where they sat, Bill suddenly entered tue car, a revolver in each haod, and confronting tbern, cried out:
i •* Move an inch to draw a weapon, pards, .and I fire, and you know I don’t waste powder.” Tbey were finely caught, and in great alarm, for they knew well the man: but he gave them po chance for thought, and continued:
“ There’s the door, pards, and tbe baggage car is next, and you can’t get into it, so move.” [ “ You haint agoin’ ter—” begun one.
[ “lam going to make you leave this car and 'at once I’- was the calm reply.
" But she’s runnin’ twenty mile a hour.”
“ All the same, go!”
, Pell-mell they went, for-each expected a shot, aud they knew Bill’s unerring aim.
> Out of the door, onto the platform, and then ,the jump, with Wild Bill following them to . the steps, they took, and on swept the cars, leaving them to their fate.
Oue of the eight was killed by the fall, and i tbe others more or less wounded, and they at once gave up their intention to win five thousand dollars by killing Wild Bill, and so told £the one who had hired them to do the red work.
CHAPTER XXIV.
A rival’s fate.
Among the friends of Wild Bill was a young lady in Abtleue, who held a very soft spot in her heart for the famous Dead Shot Hero, as he was called by many.
Whether BiU cared for her in return was never known; but there were many suitors for her love, and among them one who greatly feared tbat Hikok might become his successful rival.
To prevent this he one night determined to pick a quarrel with him and kill him. I The place found to carry out his purpose was a baU-room, and be went up and claimed the lady for a sot which he declared she had promised to dance with him, hoping Wild Bill would resent it.
Bot instead, BiU simply said he left it with ™e lady to decide wbich she would with, aDdsbe promptly took his arm.
This so maddened the jealous rival tbat he
determined to still longer bide his time, bat in tbe end take Bill’s life, when he could do so without certain death to himself, for he well knew tbe marshal’s deadly aim.
Business calling W ild BiU to a neighboring town, tbe rival followed bim there, and finding that he bad gone to a certain restaurant, thither be went also.
Glancing in at the door he saw BUI seat ed in an alcove, having just ordered his dinner.
His back was to him, and he felt that at last his opportunity had come to end the days of his rival.
Stepping quickly into the door, he drew a revolver, and gliding up to BUI, raised his weapon to fire.
But at that instant, in a glass on the wall, Bill saw his act, and threw himself upcu the floor, and the bullet plowed through the table-in a direct line, showing that it would have passed through his body had be not moved.
As be dropped under the table Bill drew a revolver and almost instantly came the sharp report, and tben the heavy fall of his would-be murderer, who met the death he would have brought upon his successful rival, and at that rival’s hands.__
CHAPTER XXV. an avenger on bill's trail.
VismNO Hayes City again, WUd Bill, in 1870, was reappointed to the position of City Marshal, for the place had not become wholly a paradise, and was still the resort of many .desperate characters who needed firm handling to keep under, when elated by bad wbisky.
He had been but a short while in town when be was secretly fired at, and narrowly escaped with his life.
BiU was dismounted, and his intended assassin weU mounted, and hence pursuit was useless and the man escaped.
Again be was fired upon through an open window, and the marshal’s shield, worn over the left breast, turned the ball, and once more the would-be assassin escaped.
A third time he was fired upon, and from an ambush.
Ho was riding into town, and out of a thicket came the flash and ring of a rifle.
At the flash the horse threw up his head and caught the bullet in his brain, thus saving his rider.
Down in his tracks sunk the horse, and before Wild BUI could extricate bimself, away went a steed and rider like the wind.
Who this untiring foe was Wild Bill could not guess; but had he been iu any doubt as to the fact that one was on his track who wished to avenge some one he bad kUled, a slip of paper pinned on his door one day would have dispeUed that doubt.
It was written in a bold hand and read:
“ Wild Bux:
“An avenger, for the death of Cole at your hands, is on your trail.
“ Your days are numbered.	Merciless.”
BiU read this warning without the quiver of a muscle; what he felt and thought his stern, sad face"never revealed.
But others who read it, for BiU left it sticking where the avenger had put it, felt that whoever it was that was trailing Wild Bill, bad better be careful or the biter might get bitten.
Going to Wichita in pursuit of a criminal. Wild Bill had just entered the saloon <>( Him tavern, when a horseman dashed up, threw his reins over the hitching rack, to which tbe marshal’s horse was fastened, and entered the room, glancing quickly around him as he did so.
Spying BiU he advanced toward him and asked pleasantly:
“ Are you the marshal of Hayes City?”
“lam."
“Your name is BiU Hikok, I believer
“ My name is James Hikok, but I am called Wild BiU,” was the calm reply.
Instantly a revolver was thrust in his faoe
and tbe flash and report followed, as tbe stranger cried:
“ Tben I avenge PhU Cole.”
BiU was fairly caught, for the air of tbe Btranger deceived him; but be was as quick in bis movements as tbe lightning’s fla*b, and managed to strike up the weapon so tbat the bullet glanced upon the frontal bone, but left a severe wound, and felled him to the floor like dead.
In fact, those who saw him faU thought he was dead, and sprung toward biro, while tbe strahger dashed out of tbe tavern, mounted his horse, and sped away unpursued.
But, only stunned by tbe buUet, Wild BiU quickly rallied, and asked for his intended as sassin.
He mounted his horse and rode away,” said tbe landlord.
“ Which road did he take?’
“The trail leading south.”
“I shall follow him,” and he arose to bis feet
“But you are seriously wounded, bleeding freely, and are not able.”
“You don’t know WUd Bill, pard, if you think he is not able to foUow a foe.”
Wild BUI I
Tbe name created a sensation there at once, for no one knew him, among that crowd, by sight, yet all knew him weU by reputation.
Covered with blood, which he wiped from his face with his handkerchief, and binding it around bis bead, be left tbe room, mounted bis horse and dashed away in pursuit.
Riding hard, be came in sight of a horseman after a couple of hours in the saddle, and recognized him as tbe man wbo had come up to him in the tavern in such a friendly way.
Tbe stranger, believiDg he had certainly killed BUI, had slackened bis pace, but turned upon bearing hoofs behind him.
Instantly, in that wild, blood-stained face, he saw an avenger on his path, aud rode away in hot haste.
But BUl’s horse was the fleetest of tbe two, and coming nearer, be opened with his revolver and soon brought down the	ridden by
his foe.
Dismounting quickly, as the other fell, Bill rushed upon him, and reoeiving unhurt tbe fire of his enemy, shot him dead.
Maddened by his wound, be cooUy took a lock of hair from the head of the dead man, rode back to the tavern, placed bimself in the care of a surgeon, and upon his return to Hayes City, tacked the death tropby up by tha side of the warning of the man who had been determined to hunt him down.
CHAPTER XXVI.
WILD BILL FALLS IN LOVX.
It was while WUd Bill was Marshal of Hayes City, that a circus came there to give an exhibition, and of course it was an exciting event for the town.
Tbe circus was owned and managed by Madam Agnes Lake, the first Maieppa rider I believe in tbe United States, and whose husband, the former proprietor, had been killed in Missouri.
Madam Lake, though the first woman at tbe bead of a large show, managed it with the greatest ability, and thus saved herself and her daughter from financial ruin after the death of her husbaud.
As is often the case, when a circus visits smaU southern aud western towns, some of tbe “ characters ” of the place decided to 1 ‘ clean it oi.t,” and assembled under the canvas for that purpose, anxious to start a row.
Madam Lake had heard that a bad lot were coming, and advised her troupe to keep quiet and orderly; but this would do no good where there were idle desperadoes bent on a flght, and tbey began to insult the circus men in various ways, and at last, wben one of them resented it, at onoe pitched upon him.
Others oame to the raicue of their ootnrade, aud a hot fight began.
But suddenly Into the midst ef the

ants spruflg a tall fora, his Arts MI right and left like sledge-hammers, and sent men to earth at every blow, acd having gotten tbe desperadoes separated, he drew his revolvers and mid quietly:
“Wow, pards, git!”
They knew that the one who gave the advice was Wild Bill, and they took it and “got.” Bill then turned to the circus men and said:
“ Go on with the fun, boys, for we won’t be distnrbed again.”
Madam Lake having seen Bill dash single-handed into the fight, and single-handed end it, and drive the mob before him, asked to have him presented to her that she might thank him. and he was taken up and introduced bya friend.
The madam received him most kindly, presented him to the members of her company, and from that meeting Wild BIU lost bis heart with the fair widow, and years after, while he was performing with Buffalo Bill and Texas -Jack upon the stage, l.e again mot Madam Lake, and they were married in Cheyenne, for the lover’s persistent wooing at last won a wife.
CHAPTER XXVII.
AJYECDOTEH Or WILD BILL AS TOLD BY BUFFALO BILL, BIS LIFE LONG’ PARD.
Buffalo Bill having had a Border Play written for him, in wbich be had an opportunity of showing those living in tbe marts of civilization rrue life upon the prairies of tbe Par West, [ revailed upon Texas Jack, a noted Plainsma i. and Wild Bill to accompany him in his dramatic tour, and the two celebrated Men of the Plains and Mountains appeared before tbe footlights in the drama known as “Scouts of the Plains. ’’
In his autobiography, a handsome book published by Frank E. Bliss, of Hartford, Buffalo BiU thus speaks of
WILD BOX AS AW ACTOR.
“ Although he had a fine stage appearance, was a handsome fellow, and possessed a good, strong voice, yet when be went upon tbe stage before an aodience, it was almost impossible for bim to utter a word. He insisted that we were making a set of fools of ourselves, and that we were the laughing-stock of the people.
“ Wild Bin was continually playing tricks on the members of tha oompany, and it was his especial delight to torment the ‘supers.’ Quite frequently in our sham Indian battles be would run tip to the ‘ Indians ’ (tbe supers), and putting his pistol close to their.Iegs, would fire at them and burn them with the powder, instead of shooting over their heads. This would make them dance and jump, s j that it was difficult to make them fall and die— although they were paid twenty-five cents each for performing the ‘dyiiig business.’ The poor ‘ supers ’ often complained to me about this, and threatened not to go on tbe stige and be killed again if that man Wild Bill did not stop shooting aud burning their legs. I would order Wild BiU to stop bis mischief; he would laugh and tben promise not to do it any more. But it would not be long before he was at his old tricks again.
“ My company, known as the ‘ Buffalo Bill Combination,’ did a fine business all through the East. WUd Bill continued his pranks, which caused us considerable annoyance, but at tbe same time greatly amused us.
WILD BILL INTERVIEWS ROUGHS.
Oim day at TitusviUe, Pennsylvania, while Burke, the business agent, was registering our names and making arrangements for our ac-comm dation, several of us started for the bU-liard room; but were met by the landlord, who stopped me and said tbat there was a party of roughs from the lower oil region who were spreeing, and had boast'-d that they were staying in .own to meet the Buffalo Bill gang and clean them out. The landlord begged of me uot to alloW'tbe members of the troupe to en-Mr the bUliard room, as he did not wfsli any light in his house. To please the landlord, and
at his suggestion, I called the boys up Into the parlor and explained to them the situation. Wild BiU wanted to go at once and fight the whole mob, but I persuaded him to keep away from them during the day.
In order to entirely avoid the roughs, the members of the company entered the theater through a private door from the hotel, as the two buildings joined each other. While I was standing at tbe door of the theater taking tickets, the landlord of the hotel came rushing np and said that WUd Bill was having a fight with the roughs in the bar-room. It seemed that Bill bad not been able to resist the temptation of going to see What kind of a mob it was that wanted to test the pluck of the Buffalo BiU party; and just as he stepped into the room, one of the bruisers put bis band on bis shoulder and said:
“Hello, Buffalo Bill! we have been looking for you all day.”
“My name is not Buffalo Bill; you are mis-taked in the man,” was the reply.
“You are a liar!” said the bruiser.
Bill instantly knocked bim down, and then seizing a chair he laid out four or five of the crowd on the floor, and drove the re«t out of the room. All thi9 wasdone in a minute or two, and by the time I got down-stairs, BUI was coming out of the bar room, whistling a lively tune.
“WeU!'’ said he, “ I have been interviewing that party who wanted to clean us out.”
“ I thought you promised to come into the Opera House by the private entrance?”
“ I did try to follow tbat trail, but I got lost among tbe canyons, and then I ran in among tbe hostilee,” said he; “ but it is aU right now. Tbey won’t bother us any more. I gueas those fellows have found us.” And sure enough tbey had. * We heard no more of them after that
WILD BILL PLAYS A LITTLE GAME. Another incident occurred, one night, at Portland, Maine. BUI found it impossible to go to sleep at the hotel on account of the continued talking of tome parties who were engaged in a game of cards in au adjoining room. He called to them several times to make less noise, but they paid little or no attention to him. Be finally got up and went to the room with tbe intention of cleaning out the whole crowd. He knocked and was admitted; greatly to his surprise, he found the party to be some merchants of the city, whom he had met the previous day. They were playing poker, and invited him to join them which he did, at tbe same time pretending to be a little green about the game; but he ended largely a winner, and at tlaylight left them with tbe parting advice never to keep a stranger awake and tben invite him to play pcfrer as a recompense.
WILD BILL’S INDIAN ACT.
Buffalo BiU also speaks of a fancy which Wild Bill had, wben discharging his revolver in an in.aginary fight upou the stage, of singeing the “ supers ” (supernumeraries) who were l>ainted aud dressed as Indians.
When any of them fell, and were supposed to be dead, killed by tbe scout iu the mimic combat, Wild BUI would fire his pistol so near to them, that be would scare the “ supers ” to life again, thus making a “ live Injun ” of a dead one.
In referring to it in bis autobiography above alluded to, Buffalo Bill says:
“The play proceeded finely until tha Indian fight in t'je second act, when Bill amused himself by his old trick of singeing the legs of the ‘supers.’
“After the curtain dropped the ‘supers’ complained to me about it. Bill’s conduct made me angry, and I told bim that be must either stop shooting the ‘ supers ’ or leave the company. He made no reply, but went to tbe dressing-room and changed bis buckskin suit for his citizen’s dress, and during one of my scenes I looked down in front and saw him elbowing his way through the audience and
out of tbe theater. When I bad finished tfl scene and had retired from the stage, tbe staS carpenter came up and said:
“ ‘ Tbat long-haired gentleman, wbo out a few minutes ago, requested me to tfl you that you could go to thunder with yod old show.’
“ That was tbe last time tbat WUd BiU anM ever performed together on the stage. Aftf tbe evening’s entertainment I met bhn at dfl Osborn House. By this time be bad recover® from bis mad fit and was in as good humor I ever. He had made up bis mind to leave tl tbe West the next day. I endeavored to pM suade him to remain with me tUI spring, aJ tben we would go together; but it was of ifl use. I then paid him tbe money due him, aJ Jack and myself made him a present of $1,00| besides.
WILD BILL AB A “STAB.”
BiU went to New York the next day, tending to start West from there. Seven days afterward I learned tbat a theatric® manager had engaged bim to play. A com pony was organized and started out, but as | “star” Wild BiU was not a success; ttfl further he went the poorer be got. TtJ didn’t suit Bill by any means, and be accord ingly retired from tbe stage. The companj however, kept on tbe road, using Bill’s nam and employing au actor to represent him w only on the stage but on tbe street and els where. BUI heardjof. this deception and sel word to tbe manager to stop it, but no attei tion was paid to bis message.
So he determined to take satisfaction bimseli and accordingly went to the town where th combination was playing and bought himsal an orchestra aeat far forward, and sat down M witness tbe performance.
When the bogus WUd Bill, represent!]) himself, appeared, WUd BiU sprung upon tl stage, slung the manager into the oichestr an 1 burled his impersonator through a ma of scenery representing rock, and which, foi tunate for him was only painted canvas.
Wild BiU then resumed his seat, and a po liceman was sent to arrest him.
“ How numerous are youf’ calmly asked Wild Bill of the officer.
‘ ‘ I am alone,” was the reply.
“ You had better get some help,” said BiU The officer then caUed up another policeman, and BiU again asked:
“ How many of you are there now?”
“ Two,” was the reply.
“Tben I advise you to go and get som*; more reinforcements,” said Bill, very cooUy.
The policeman thereupon spoke to tbe sheriff who was dressed in citizen’s clothes. Tbs sheriff came up and said he wonld have to tak* him into custody.
“ AU right, sir,” replied BUI, “I have no ob-jections to walking out with you, but I wont go with any two policemen.” At tbe court next morning BiU stated his reasons for bavinf acted as be bad done, and tbe judge fined bim only three dollars and costs.
STAGE WHISKY.
Buffalo Bill also told the author of these incidents and adventures in tbe Ufe of Wild BiH tbe following amusing story of tbe lattar's first appearance on the stage:
“ We bad several rehearsals together,” said Buffalo BiU, “and of course tbe stage proper' ties were not used, only ‘ make believe,’ so ha could understand what was to be dene.
*• But tbe nigbt he appeared, the first scene in which be took part represented a camp-fire, around which Texas Jack and myself were sitting teUing stories. In order to cany out the scene so that it should be a faithful counterfeit of tbe reality, we had a whisky bottle fUled with cold tea, which we passed from one to the other at tbe conclusion of each story. When it came Bill’s turn to relate an adventure I passed him the bottle, and taking it ia the way with which he was very familiar. b»' -commenced draining the content*. I say com*
UMI
menced, became he stopped very suddenly and Vported tbe tea right-out on the stage, at tbe j£aine time saying, in a voice loud enough for Ihe audience to hear him: ‘ You must think I'm ■the worst fool east of the Rockies, that I cant Sell whisky from cold tea This don’t oount, innd I cant tell a story under the temptation ■inlets I get real whisky.’ I tried to remon-atrate with him, while the audience fairly [»book down the galleries with tbeir cheers. At aint I was greatly mortified »nd provoked; £but I soon discovered tbat in tbe few words be Sad said, and his real acting of disgust, Wild Will, unintentionally on his part, however, bad ttnade a great bit”
CHAPTER XXV t L
HA VXD BV A LOOKING-GLASS.
Having found tbat as an actor be was not a success, Wild BiU returned West to thn haunts be <6 well loved, and at once became aware, through certain hints tbat were dropped, that qoother avenger was on his trail.
Wbo it was be did not know fur some time, and tben only discovered it by accident, as be At reading one morning in a saloon in Chey-
■'Two men entered, and as Wild Bill’s face was jjidden by tbe newspaper, did not recognize him, and as they stepped up to the bar one fid:
; “You are sure he will coma here?'1 , "Yes, I was just told by Jack Dunston he ljail made an appointment to meet bim here wi’hio an hour.”
Wild BiU beard their words, and knowing thnt he bad jost made such an appointment «iih tbe party named, knew tbat they referred to him.
Instantly he determined to face the music boldly, when be saw, by a looking-glass over tht bar, that they bad recognized him and were both drawing their weapons.
, At onoe he drew his double-barreled Derringer and sprung to his feet, just as a shot Whistled by his bead, and another struck the table by which he sat
\ To reply was the work of a second, and one Of his enemies dropped dead; but the second barrel missed Are, and hurling the pistol at the (remaining man, grappled him, and they feU, and WUd BiU arose unhurt, while the neck of his adversary was broken from having fallen With such force upon bis head.
CHAPTER XXIX.
,	OK* OUT OF FIVE .
. Upon one occasion WUd BHi and tour comrades started on a prospecting tour into the Black Hills country, which was then reported ts being rich in gold mines, several old trap-|ers and hunters having been there and discovered traces of the precious metal, which all ftiid would pan out fortunes for those who kilned for it
| The companions of Wild Bill on this trip %■ ore men in whom he had tbe greatest confidence, and for whom be felt strong ties of friendship.
They were aU thorough prairie and mountain men, were up to aU the wUes of the Indians, and had stood up without flinching in many a desperate encounter.
Thoroughly equipped for mining and hunt iiig, well mounted and armed, and leading three pack-horses with their stores, they set out for tbe new Eldorado.
WeU they knew that they were going into a dangerous locaHty, where tbe lndiaa£ imbit iteredby the invasion of their hunting-grounds jbj tbe whites, woald show them no mercy j But' tbey were men who bad confidence in flh^mselves, and the golden results tbey booed jtoo'c'the * **** <**n®er’ *n<^ willingly : Pitching their camp on French River, they *0t *ort a wiB, and built a secure and coafcwtabU cabin, with a stable adjoining lor ; *eir bones, and than began tbe task ot proe-s l>««tiug for gold.
| It was tbe rule of the party tbat one of the
five should remain about camp aU day or bunt near it and do the cooking, providing game, and looking after the horses, whUe the other four went to tbe mines.
Taking turns, this work in rotation feU upon all successively, and as they bad agreed to share tbe resulls of tbeir mining labor, tbey got along most harmoniously.
The party thus bad passed some months together, and were meeting with considerable luck, whi-u oue day it was Wild BUl’s duty to remain in t-amp.
He got things to rights, had made all preparations to get dinner, and then started out to And it, by shooting the game.
Intent in creeping upon a herd of deer, be went further and further from camp, and when he at last brought down a fine young buck, he found it was nearly sunset, and that he bad some ten miles to walk back to camp with bis load.
Taking what choioe parts of the buck he wanted, be shouldered them and started on his return.
Darkness overtook him before be had gone far, but he cared little for that, other than tbe thought that his comrades would come in from tbeir work and find no hearty supper prepared for them.
Hastening along he had reached a spot but a quarter of a mile from tbe camp in tbe canyon, wheu he was startled by a series of wild yells and rapid shots from revolvers.
Down to the ground was cast his load of venison, for he had recognized tha yeU of the Blackfeet Indians, whose Reservation tbey had camped upon, and knew that they had attacked his companions.
For a few minutes the fighting waged hot, and then ceased, and wild yells of triumph alone were beard.
At this moment Wild Bill appeared upon tbe scene
At a glance he took in the situation, and that his absence had gotten his comrades into the ambush, for the red-skins had entered the cabin, and awaiting the return of the miners, had rushed out upon them, and taken by surprise, and overwhelmed by numbers the fight could be but short and have a fatal termination for tbe whites.
Wild BUI, under ordinary circumstances, would have held back when he saw that the fight was ended; but now he was angry with himself for having gone so far from camp, maddened at tbe loss of his comrades, and observing tbat two of them, though lying upon the ground, were not yet dead, he determined tbat they at least should not die with the beUef tbat be had deserted them.
With a revolver in each hand, and with yells that rung back savagely from tbe canyon’s sides, be rushed upon the scene.
Ere the astonished Indians knew what had happened half a dozen of their number, bad fallen dead before his unerring aim, and the remainder, more than a score in number were seeking shelter, as they felt confident that one man had not alone charged in upon them.
Reaching the side of one of his comrades, he saw tbat he had. just breathed his last, and a second was dying, ond his sca’p was gone.
Recognizing him, he said plainly: “ It is all up with us, BiU; save yourself, for it’s four out of five now.”
Wild Bill was in a frenzy of rage, and as a horse was near he threw bimself upon his back and charged through tbe canyon uuburt by tbe fire of the red-skins, several more of whom however he brought to grief with his revolvers.
He had disappeared from sight before the Indians realized that be was alone, and then, with wild yells of rage and disappointment they started in pursuit, tbe blazing cabin which they had set on Are, lighting the canyon from end to «nH
CHAPTER YYY
THE CHASE, the horse he rode to his utmost
speed, WUd BiU kept him at it until he felt that be needed rest, and tben came to a halt and remained in camp until daylight
He weU knew his dangerous situation, alone and almost without ammunition, with hostile Indians not only on his trail, but others bating the pale-faces, aU around bim; bat be did not. despair, as he was a man wbo was game to tbe end.
Many long miles lay before bim ere be could reach the nearest settlement, and the horse he rode was not of the best; but stiU be counted that as long as he lived there was hope, and he determined to take tbe chances and tbe hope.
He was anxious to reach Fort Fetterman, and having breakfasted upon atageben, which be knocked over with his revolver, and bis horse being rested, and content witb bit feast of grass, be mounted and started in tbe direction in wbich bis prairie-craXt told him tbe fort lay.
He had not ridden very long before be felt that in the darkness be bad thoroughly eluded bis pursuers, and that after waiting untU daylight before they could find tbe trail, they would hardly continue the chaae, as it would be useless, with eight hours’ start wbich be bad.
But this thought was not much relief, for ha knew the country was full of both Blackfeet and Sioux, and the attack upon tbe miners’ cabin proved to bim tbat they bad at last gone on tbe war-path to drive aU of tbe whites out of their country, and tbe chances were ninety-nine to a hundred that be would run upon a band of them at any moment
He jvas going quietly along when his licise suddenly started forward, and, glancing back, BUI discovered some fifteen mounted Indians close upon bim.
At a glance he saw that tbey were Sioux, and had evidently only a short while before struck his trail and foUowed it.
Instantly he urged bis horse into a run, and at once the chase began, for tbe red-skins came on in rapid pursuit, yelling like demons.
Pressing tbe animal bard, WUd BiU held his own for an hour or more, but then his horse began to raU, as he readily saw, while tbe Indian ponies, tough as pine knots, came on at the same untiring gallop they bad commenced tbe pursuit with.
It now was urgent for WUd BiU to depend upon his own strategy to escape rather than his horse, and be at once closely observed the nature of the country around bim.
Observing some high, rugged bills, he urged bis tired horse for them, and at their base tbe animal stumbled and fell, throwing bis rider over his head.
But Wild BiU had been fearing and watching for just such a tumble, and, nimble as a cat, he caught on his feet and continued tbe flight on up tbe hilL
Tbe Indians dasbed by his feUen, broken-down steed, and, pressing on up the steep hUl, gave a sudden yell of triumph as tbey saw bim hesitate, then stop, dart one way, then another, and tben turn and face them.
With shouts of triumph and war-cries tbey rushed upon him, while he waited until tbey got within range, and then his revolvers opened, one held in each hand.
Down went a pony there, off feU a red-ekin here, and in almost ten seconds of time, three mustangs and two warriors were down, ai.d the revolvers were empty.
This the cunning Indians discovered, and. where their charge had been temporarily checked, they again rushed forward with rage at tbe lots of tbeir comrades, and u moot earnest desire to get the scalp of Wild Bill, whom several of them recognized, having faced him in many a fight before, and weU knew bis terrible aim.
But, as tbey advanced, confident now of their prey, Wild BiU gave one long, loud about of defiance, and sprung backward and disappeared from sight
Upon arriving at the spot the foiled red-akin* discovered that be bad been standing on tlv
Adventures of Wild Bill.
edge of a predp4oe, which overhung n foaming torrent, rushing at fts base, sixty feet below.
From this dray bight Wild Bill had boldly taken the leap, and the rushing waters bad received him in tbeir bosom and burled him on unhurt down the stream, and out of sight of his foes.
For several miles Wild Bill kept in the foaming torrent, borne along with frightful rapidity and tben looked about for means of getting out, for he was almost prostrated by his fierce struggle.
A little way back he had passed a good landing place, but pi'eferred to go on further nnd look for another; but now he found biirself in a dangerous predicament, for the stream here ran through precipitous sides, wh*-re it was impossible to find a landing, and there o.mo to his ears the roar of a cataract aheal.
As fortune seems to over favor the brave, there bung over from the banks above a network of vines, several'of the larger ends even touching the water, and at once Wild Bill determined to use these as a means of escape.
As he neared them he raised his hands and took firm hold, and though tbe shock was a great one, and ported- some of the smaller vines above, it held him securely, and he dragged himself up out of tbe stream and managed to reach a place where he could rest.
Having done bo; he crept up the vines and thence along the net-work to tho cliff above, and in a sheltered nook suuk down almost prostrated and fell fast asleep.
,9PAPTE$ TCXXT HATOHINO INDIAN CtTNNTNO.
Whzn Bill awoke; from his sleep of deep prostration, after bis battle with tho torrent, hi* found tbat it was dark, and not being ablo to Know what kind of locality be wa« in, ho felt forced to remain until daylight, as any movement might precipitate him over a precipice. *• Tin awful hungry, and could eat an Injun porterhouie steak,” he muttered, “but I don’t thiok even a red-8kin can follow my trail tbe way I came here, so I’ll just remain and see what daylight will bring.
• “I guess I’ll sleep and forget how hungry I am," and, all wet and hungry that he was, ho soon sunk again into a deep slumber.
•The sun, struggling through tbe dense undergrowth, that oovered the banks of tbe river, fell into the face of the tired man and awoke nirn, and his first utterance was:
“ Jerusha! b< w hungry I am: - I guess I’ve had sleep enough to give a little for grub.”
Rising, he felt at first, as be expressed it, •‘stiff as a stove-up old cavulry horse,’’ but creeping out of the bushes he soon limbered himself up by a walk; and peering cautiously around him, went in search of something to eat, and with considerable anxiety not to be disoovered by the Indians, who be seemed to feel bad not given up searching for him.
Fortunately for bim he bad six cartridges for one revolver, and they had been in an oilskin tobacco pouch, and were not wet.
Loading one of bis- revolvers with these, which he prised as though each shot was u diamond of rare value, be continued bis way, several limes tempted to kill game that he saw, bat each time forbearing, as he feared the redskins might hear tbe shot.
“I’vegot one shot for something to eat, and five for the reds; with the one shot I must get game large enough to last me to Fetterman, wbich I can make in four days, if the ludians will only let me, and I’ve got just two matches to start a lira with, so I’m forced to be economical for once in my life,’’he said with a grim smile.
At last, feeling that be was out of ear-shot of tbe stream, and discovering a deer, he crept near enough, and raising his revolver fired.
It dropped with his unerring shot, and Bill lost no time in catting off meat enough to last him for several days, after which be started on, anxious to get away from tho vicinity of Uaflrtag, in oa»t» any Indian had beard it.
He had just turned into a canyon, wben ; around ahead, almost upon him, dashed a j mounted warrior.
Though expecting Indians to appear at any time. Bill was taken by surprise, but did not lose his presence of mind The red skin was also taken by surprise, and tried to suddenly wheel his horse, having no weapon in his band, and his rifle being slung at bis back.
But Wild Bill bounded forward, seized the rein of the pony, and at the same instant pulled the trigger, as his pistol muzzle pointed full at the head of the savage.
With tbe report the Indian dropped to the ground, and wren:bing fro&n bis back tbe rifle, it was but tbe work of an instant for Wild Bill to throw himself upou the back of the frightened mustang, for the clatter of coming hoofs reached his ears, and he knew that the warrior had not been alone.
“ I’ll give ’em a surprise as tbey round the bend,’’he muttered, and raising the rifl?, as several mounted Indians came in view he flred.
A mustang dropped, and its rider fell heav- j ily, and dashing tbe now useless rifle away, for he had no more ammunition for it, Wild Bill turned to fly.
Instantly tho red-skins, who had drawn up at his shot, came on in pursuit, and looking back the fugitive saw that they were over a score in number and not those who had been in chase of bim before.
“The woods are full of ’em, and from present prospects Fori F.-tternmn seem? about ten thousand miles away, for I’m blest if I know which way to go,” lie muttered.
But all tbe time he kept liis captured pony at full speed, and presently came in sight of the very stream that he bad scudded down so swiftly the day bafore.
He recognized the place he was approaching as the spot he had thought of landing upon, aud ot once he saw to venture into the stream would be to go to his death, for the bank on tbe other side was a smooth cliff, and a hundred yards below the shore upon which he stood was also as precipitous.
To turn back now ho saw was imjtossible, for the Indians were close at hand, and already . their bullets were pattering around him, and I plunging into the water.
“ Guess I've got to have it out right here, ’’ he mu’.tered
But, as fie turned to face his foes, a sudden thought flashed through hi3 miod, and he urged his horse down the bank, until he came to the last point on that shore where he could enter the torrent.
Then he Baid, with a grim smile:
“Pony, I guess we’ll take a sail, and if I don’t mistake you’ll have company." r-Intothe foaming torrent he forced the frightened mustang, and the next minute he was sweeping along at a terrific rate just as the redskins dashed up to the spot “ Come on and get my scalp I “Ob, you red-skin cowards!
“ You are afraid to follow a white man I “Come on and I’ll meet you below I “ You are a pack of cowardly squaws, and no warriore!”
These taunt: he shouted back in the Sioux tongue, which he spoke well, and, as he had expected, they had the desired effect, for tbe Indians forced their ponies to take the water, and the next minute the whole party were flying along with tbe current, in pursuit
“They don't know this country, and wbat a picnic Fve got for them around the bend, or they’d never have followed,” said Bill, as his pony was swept on, fifty yards in advance.
Anxious to steady their horses the red-skins had all they could do and only hoped to overtake tbo white hunter on solid ground.
But, as tbey swept around the bend, and observed that tbe banks on either side were solid walls of rock they seemed to realize their danger,aud some of them vainly urged their ponies to attempt to stem the torrent.
But the effort was-a futile one, un they at
once saw; and they vented their fury with will
yells of' hatred.
Suddenly they felt tbat another dangee faced them, for tbey heard the roar of the cat aract aheao.
“Oh! they hear the music now, and 1 guea they are mad,” said Bill.
But a moment after he saw that he must look to his own safety and carry out tbe suddea thought, which had seized upon bim, jtut as b* was about to turn and fight the red-skins bad upon tbe bank of the stream.
“ If tbe grape-vine breaks, I’ll be in at tb< picnic too,” he said, and then he guided hil pony towaid it.
Nearer and nearer he came, and freeiug him self from the Indian saddle, and slipping onu the back of the pony behind it, he strt tolled forth his hands for the grasp upon the vines.
When almost upon it the pony sudden I j swerved, and nearly made him lose his grip! but springing upon tbe back of tbe animal wi« bis feet, he gave a jump and seized the stotf vine.
It cracked aud gave badly under tbe shock but band over hand be went to a place o safety, and felt that the net work would boll his weight
“ But it won’t bold two, nor will this fanoi bridge stand many more «Uch pulls,” he mute ton'd, and tben added significantly, “111 sol tbat it don’t get any more sncb pulls either.” F
As be spoke he drew his revolver,-with it five loaded chambers. »nd eat swinging upo*| his bridge of vines, and .waiting.

After drawing bis revolver, and seeing that the Indians were yet quite a distance away,. Wild Bill glanced after the pony be had just deserted, and said sadly:	1
“ It’s a bard trick to play on you, old boise$ after yon have saved my life; but my life it' more precious to me than yours is.”
He saw also, from bis lofty perch, lbat tW stream tumbled over a fall of some fifteen feef and below was one mass of ragged rocki through which it rushed with fury, and lookc# like a torrent of milk, rather than water, so, white was the foam as far as the eye couM| reach.
“That will settle ’em I know; now to bust8 ness,’’ and he turned to the Indian who wsf guiding his pony so as to allow him to gi'sap the vine as he went under.
“ I should have cut these off with my knif« as I came ap; but I guess this will do,” he muttered, and raising bis revolver be flred, just as a red skin grasped tbe vine.
Into the surging waters, without even s' deatb-cry went the warrior, and a second swept by, not daring to catch at the vine.
Bat a third got his hand upon it, and he toff fell from his pony, with a bullet in his brain?
A fourth, fifth and sixth then went by, and tben another made tbe desperate attempt, and bis arm dropped, broken at tbe elbow.
“I’ve only got two more shots, and I hop4 they won’t try it again,” said Bill.
And tbey did not, for thote wbo came btf> hind seemed to be more in dread of the deadljf aim of their pale-face foe tban of tbe catara<4 ahead, and swept by under tbe vine.
Some had fired at Wild Bill, and one or tw» bullets had come uncomfortably near to hia| but tbe Indians bad all tbey could do to loot ! after themselves in tbe seething torrent, an4 soon discovered that all tbeir prowess and cou^ age could not save them.
Climbing onto the rock bank, Wild Bill n* along it until he came to a point where hi ' could see tbe fall, and with a grim, stern tact, he saw his foes hurled over and over to de-structiou, Indiana and ponies being clashed ta pieces against the ragged rocks.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
fHB DEATH OF WILD BILL.
i Ab all careers must have an end, so at last came the end, end a bitter one, to Wild Bill, ■for he fell by-the hand of an assassin when in the very prime of his eventful life, having just passed his fortieth year.
He bad goue with a milling expedition into Stbe Black Hills, and bad every prospect of digging a fortune of yellow goli out of tbe earth, ■when one afternoon be entered a saloon and tongaged in a game of cards with a young man Iby the name of Jack McCall, and who was in [fact, a mere boy in years.
J As Bill was tbe winnertn tbe game of chance, 'lloCall treasured against him a desire for re-; venge, though he did not then exhibit ill-feeling toward bin. ,
But he plotted to cut short the life of Wild Bill, and to carry out his purpose, several days after be met with bis loss, he went to a j place where he knew bis victor was enjoying a sociuble game, nodded pleasantly to all as be I entered, and made bis way to the back of bis ; intended victim.
Then, suddenly drawing a revolver, he placed ' it against the back of Wild Bill’s head anti flred.
Through the massive skull tbe bullet crashed i Its way, and buried itself in tbe arm of Bill’s ; partner in the game of cards.
Wild Bill, without a groan or sigh, sunk dead across the table, the hero of a hundred combats cut down in his Btrength by tho hand of an assassin whom he believed a friend.
After killing Wild Bill, McCall made good bis escape, but eventually surrendered himself; an impromptu trial was held, and the jury pro-nouDced the murderer “ not guilty.”
But, although he left Dead wood after his strange acquittal, Jack McCall was afterward arrested by a United States Marshal, and ha was tried, found guilty, sentenced and hanged.
In a romantic spot in the mountains Wild Bill, his rifle by his side, his revolvors belted around him, was buried by bis friends, and above his lonely grave Charlie Utter, “Colorado Charlie,” erected a marble monument, upon which is bis name, date of birth and death, and the words:
“ Pard, we will meet again In the Happy Hunting Grounds to part no more."	8
Thus ended tbe life of J. B. Hikok, “ Wild Bill,” and none knew him but will say:
“ Oh Charity I oome fling your mantle about him, sod!" 804harshv~fc*r be sleeps ’noath the
