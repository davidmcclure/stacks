BY AN OLD SCOUT.
CHAPTEE i
YOUNG TVILD WEST MEETS THE MINE GIRL,
“Get back, you cowards! Don’t dare to come another step nearer! This is my mine, and I will hold it as long as I am able £o fight! My father willed the claim to me, and you shall not take it from me. Back! Look out, Hap Morton! I will-”
Crack!
The sharp report of a revolver rang out on the clear morning air, followed instantly by a cry of pain.
The scene was a dramatic one, with surroundings that were fitted to it.
Standing at the mouth of a mine shaft at the foot of a towering cliff was a young * girl, the picture of defiance and desperation.
Before her, not more than thirty feet from the mine shaft, were four rough-looking men.
One of them had been touched on the arm with the bullet that came from the girl’s revolver, and he was now holding his hand upon the wound to allay the pain and stop the flow of blood.
Hap Morton, as she called him, had dared to take a step nearer in defiance of her command, and he had received a taste of what she had threatened.
It was plain that the four ruffians knew the girl well, and that they were no strangers to her.
"See here, .Sallie Bacon! You’re jest makin’ a fool of yourself!” said one, who appeared to be the leader. “You know well enough that you ain’t fit ter run a mine like this. Your dad left it ter yer, all right, but he didn’t calculate that you was goin’ ter run it. Me an’ ther boys . "ive yer a fair an’ square offer, an1 yer wouldn’t accept it.
' Tfrfr;, fur your own good, we're goin’ tor take charge. Vou've fired a shot at us, an' yer hit Hap Morton. Yer
might jest as well have killed him as not! Now, you jest give in, or it’ll be all ther worse fur yer! We’re goin’ ter take ther mine an’ run it fur yer, an’ let yer have a third interest in what’s made. That’s a fair an’ square proposition, an’ you’ve got ter accept it.”
“Got to, eh? Well, you’ve heard what I’ve said. Con Decker! Don’t undertake to get possession of this mine. If. you do some of you will die ! I’ve been nicknamed the Mine Girl, and yore can bet I am going to hold my mine! If you know when you’re well off you will get away from here as soon as possible. When I get ready to let some one run the mine for me I’ll pick out honest men—not such a thieving gang as you are! Do you understand what I say?”
“Yes,” Con Decker replied, a scowl showing on his face. “I understand what yer say. gal. Now I want you' ter understand what 1 say! If 3rer don’t give in, an’ let us take possession we’ll have ter shoot yer down, that’s all. Do yer want tor die, Sallie Bacon?”
“No, I don’t want to die, Con Decker! And you can bet that I won’t die, unless you die first- I have got you covered, you villain, and I can shoot pretty straight. I will try hard the next time I fire to hit something a little more tender than an ami. I didn't try to kill Hap -Morton, but I will try to kill you, if you come one step nearer!”
At this two of the men drew back.
The Mine Girl thought they were about to give in. to her.
But the villains had no such purpose in view.
The two kept on backing away until they got behind a big rock.
•Then one of them pushed out the barrel of a rifle and covered the brave girl, who was trying so hard to defend the mine her father had left her at his death, which had occurred less than a week before the opening of our story.

YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE MIKE GIRL.
‘•'Drop that shooter, gal!” called out the scoundrel with the rifle. "I hate ter shoot a female; but I'm goin' ter do it, if yer don’t drop that shooter!”
The face of the girl turned a shade paler.
She now realized that she had played a desperate game —and lost!
That the man meant to keep his word she had no doubt, so she let the weapon she had held them at bay with fall to the ground.
“Wow!” yelled the leader of the ruffian?, exultantly. “That's ther way ter do it! Now, then, we'll see who is boss here I”
"Hold on, there, you sneaking coyotes!”
The voice rang out from a point to the left, and, turning, the astonished villains saw an athletic boy, attired in a fancy hunting suit of buckskin, approaching.
He held a revolver in either hand, and one glance told the villains that they were covered.
“Just let that girl alone, or the undertaker of Silver Shaft will have a pretty big job on hand,” went on the boy, coolly, as he walked up and stood between the girl and her villainous tormentors. “You see who is boss here now, I am!”
The four men were astounded.
There was something about the bearing and manner of the boy that told them plainly that he was not to be trifled with.
“Who in thunder are you?” gasped Con Decker, when he found the use of his tongue.
“Oh. I guess that doesn’t matter. I am a stranger in this camp, but that makes little difference. I happened to ccme along and hear voices, so I thought I’d come over and see what was going on. I had just started when I heard a shot fired. Then I knew something was up. So you four galoots are trying to make the girl give up the mine, are you? Well, just make up your minds that she is not going to do it. You hear what I say? Not going to do it!”
The boy had the drop on them; there was no question about that.
While they each had a revolver in their hands, they felt that they dared not attempt to turn them upon him.
“Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the Mine Girl, derisively. “Now yer know who is boss, Con Decker! I.don’t know who the young gentleman is, but I can see that he is all wool and a yard wide. You cowards, you! Why don’t you try to do something now?”
“If they don’t put their shooters away in just thirty seconds lead is going to fly!” answered the boy, without taking his eyes from the quartette. “I mean business!” They did not need any further hints, and in their belts went the revolvers.
“Now, light out, you sneaking coyotes!”
The command came from the boy, tharp and clear. “Let’s argue ther question a little, young fellet ,” paid the leader of the gang, holding up his hand. “Ther gal is mi.-inken if she think* we meant ter rob her, or anything like that. We wa.s goin? ter give her a third if wo took ther ft-ino an* worked it fur her. lhwts a mighty fair y>»*opotMtio7). T reckon.”
“You coo!-"n’t work the rnmc for me, not if you gave me all!” spoke up the girl. “I don’t want anything to do
with you. You four are no good! And there are more like yon in Silver Shaft, too. You. ought to be all hanged, that's what!”
“Or shot,” the boy added, ns he brushed back the long, chestnut hair that hung over his shoulders, and held them covered with the revolver in his right hand.
Con Decker now turned and started from the spot, followed by his three men.
He knew that the interview was at an end, and be did not want to get into any further trouble.
They went straight for the cluster of shanties that were below in a little valley, not more than a quarter of a mile distant.
This place was called Silver Shaft, so named from the tali shaft of glistening rock that reared itself on the lef of the pass that gave entrance* to the little vallG)r*
There were not more than twenty shanties in die place, and a few tents were scattered about.	...
But it had all the appearances of being a hustling i lie mining camp, for the different claims surrounding » collection of shanties and tents had all the evidence o being worked.	.
“Well, miss,” said the boy, who had happened a oag time to assist the girl, “I reckon they've g°t enoug/^ for a while, anyhow. What was it all about? I ^ heard part of what was said, and that was enough o • ^ me understand that they were trying to got you in some way. This claim is yours, eh?” . me.

I have heard dad 0?1ce, a1’1* yon all lot.-: of times, lie saw you in Tombsto^ yc*. b;< wve a great account of you. Are the gu now?”
YOUNG WILD WEST AXD THE MINE GIRL.
"Yes. They are back of that ridge there, where we camped last night, not knowing we were so near to the mining camp. I took a walk aroiuid after breakfast to try and get a shot at a deer, and the first thing I knew I was looking down upon a hustling, little settlement. Then I happened to walk this way and hear voices. I reckon we'll move our camp over close to your claim, and then if the four galoots come to bother you any more we'll be handy by.”
“Say, Young Wild West!’-' spoke up the Mine Girl, her eyes showing her eagerness, “won’t you camp right here on my claim? Here’s water right handy, and there’s grass for your horses right over there. If you only wait until I get things in shape here I’ll be ever so much obliged to you?”	|
“All right, Miss Bacon. We certainly will camp here, if it is your wish. We came over to Silver Shaft to find out what sort of a place it was, and to try and make a little money. We are alwa37s looking for fortune and adventure, you know. Just take a walk over to the camp with me, and I’ll introduce you to the girls and my partners.”
The girl hesitated.
“Suppose Con Decker and his men should come back and take possession?” she asked.
“I reckon there is no fear of that. But if they do we will soon make them let go. No such a gang as that can bluff us.”
. “I will go with you, then, Mr. West.”
“All right. Come right along. It won’t take us long to move over here. The camp is only about five minutes’
walk from here.”
The two walked up the hill and were soon at the top of the ridge, which was covered with a growth of pines
and stunted oaks.
Just as they got to the top a rifle shot sounded fiom the left and a bullet passed through the crown 01 Young \\ ild West’s hat!
“Ah!” he exclaimed. “Those fellows are rather bad, I guess. That fellow meant me. They must have turned when they got to the bend below, just for the purpose of getting a shot at me.”
He pulled the girl behind a rock as lie spoke and then watched in the direction the shot had come from.
rlhe next minute he saw a man creeping through the bushes about a hundred yards away, holding a rille ready to shoot.
“I won’t kill that galoot, Miss Bacon,” said Young Wild West; “but I'll make him drop that rifle. Just watch, now!”
The boy threw his rifle to his shoulder, and, taking a quick aim, pulled the trigger.
As the report rang out the creeping man uttered a yell and dropped the rifle.
CHAPTER IT.
THE MIXE.GIRL MEETS THE FRIENDS OF YOUNG WILD WEST.
“I told you 1 would make him drop it,” said Young Wild A\est, coolly. "Look at the galoot go! I reckon I just grazed his shirt sleeve with the bullet. That is what 1 tried to do, anyhow.”
“Great!” exclaimed the Mine Girl, her eyes sparkling
with delight and astonishment. “I never saw such close shooting as that. You are a deadshot, all right. IleMol I guess your friends are coming up here to find out what is going on.”
‘•'That’s right,” the boy answered. “'They are Cheyenne Charlie and Jim Dart, my two partners. And here comes Arietta, my sweetheart, too.”
“'I want to get acquainted with her,” said the Mine Girl, showing great interest. “She must be an awful nice girl, from what I’ve heard.” •
“I reckon she’s about the nicest in the world,” Young Wild West answered. “That is my way of thinking, anyhow.”
He was still keeping a watch in the direction the cowardly shot had been fired from, for he was not so sure that the villains would not try it again, even if he had made one of them drop his rifle and run.
But he saw nothing more of them, and he stepped out from behind the rock to meet the two coming up the hill.
Cheyenne Charlie was in the lead. He was a tall ran. • somewhere about the age of thirty, and wore his hair, which was almost jet biaek, hanging down over his shoulders.
A drooping mustache of the same hue adorned his upper lip, and the rather handsome face that was tanned by the sun and winds of the prairies gave him the appearance of being just what lie was—a scout and an all-around W esterner.
Behind him came Jim Dart, a boy about the same age as our dashing, young hero.
Both were attired in fancy hunting suits, the same as he, and were armed with Winchesters, revolvers and hunting knives.
^ oung Wild West and his partners had been born and bred in the Wild West, and to them the whole of it was a home. They loved the wilderness and its dangers, -and they meant to stick to it as long as they lived, for they knew it would be a long time after they had passed away that the Wild West would remain. There was too much of it to be transformed into cities, towns, villages and farms in a century—that is to say, all of it.
Sallie Bacon, the Mine Girl, admired the looks of all three of them as heroes of the Wild West ; but when sh<> took a good look at the golden-haired girl, who was hastening up the hill to j'oin them, she gave a nod, and called out :
“Here comes the boss girl of the West! I know you, Arietta, though I never saw you before!”
“Well, I don’t know you.” was the calm reply. “But I like you. I'll bet that you were in some kind of trouble, and that Wild helped you out!”
“You are right. I was in trouble—serious trouble, ioo —and Young Wild West happened to come along just in time to help me out. 1 am afraid he has made enemies by it, though.”
“Well, that is a way he has got—helping people out, and making enemies.”
“What good is a feller what ain’t got no cnemio-?” spoke up Cheyunue Charlie, as he curled the ends of Ms mustache anil looked at the two girls. “When a vum or boy kin make enemies here in this part of tin.? country,
/

YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE JIINE GIRL.
he kin make friends. Wild makes friends wherever he goes among good, honest people. Them what ain't honest is bound ter be his enemies. Now. if yer don't mind, yer kind tell us wliat that shootin’ was about jest now?
“Well. Charlie,” answered Wild, as he was always called by his partners and friends, "four ruffians were trying to take a claim away from this young lady, who is called the Mine. Girl here in Silver Shaft, because her father died and left her a good-paying mine. I happened to hear them talking and making all kinds of threats, and I liur-ried to the scene, after she had shot one of them in the arm. I soon made them change their minds about it, and then they lit out. Then I started to fetch the Mine .Girl over to our camp. One of the galoots was hiding over there, and he sent a bullet at me. I just got behind the rock over there and waited for him to show up. Then I let him have a bullet just so it would graze his arm and make him drop his rifle. It worked all right, didn’t it, Miss Bacon?”
"You bet it did.” the girl replied, her eyes sparkling with pleasure at falling in with such fine people. "But don’t call me Miss Bacon, any of you. My name is Sallie.
T am only eighteen years old, so I guess 1 don t want any one to address me as Miss.” * ‘
“All right, Sallie,” and our hero laughed, good na-turedlv.
"So yer jest teched tlier galoot on ther arm, hey?” Cheyenne Charlie said, shaking his head. "Yer might better have shot ther measly coyote through ther heart Wild. He meant you, all right, when he fired at yer, yer • kin bet on that!”
"Oh. I haven’t the least doubt about that, Charlie. But I never want to shoot a man unless I have to in order to save my own life, or that of some one else.”
“S’pose we go and look them four galoots up, Wild?” spoke up. Jim Dart. "We need some things down to the store, anyhow. It will be a good idea to find out just what we are up against.”
"All right, Jim. Now, Et,” and the boy turned to his sweetheart, "you escort Sallie, the Mine Girl, over to the camp, and keep her there till we come back. Just tell Hop and Wing to come on down to the store, and let them fetch one of the pack horses with them. We will stock up with what we need, for we are going to camp right on the claim that the ruffians want to take away from Sallie.”
"All right, Wild.” retorted Arietta. "Don't interfere with the villains unless they bother you. Perhaps they have had enough of it, and won’t bother you any more.” "That’s all right, Et. I know how to do it. You need not worry about me.”
"Oh, I am not worrying,” the girl said, quickly. "But
yon kmnv-M
"I know,” interrupted Sallie Bacon. "You don’t want him to get shot, because you love him with all your heart. I don't lilame you.. Arietta.”
The charming sweetheart of Young Wild West blnshe to the roots of her hair, and, waving her hand to the departing trio, turned and look the Mine <ijrl by the arm aiid ‘starter' for ihc camp with her
Young Wild Wtft and his two partners proceeded d«wn
into the little valley, keeping a watch on the ridge as they did so.
Those who had read about Young Wild West know quite well that he was the Champion Deadshot of the West at the time of which we write, which was a few years ago. when things were in an unsettled state throughout the mining regions of that part of the country.
He was also called the Prince of the Saddle, because he was without a peer at breaking and riding the wild horses of the plains.
Having practiced with a rifle and revolver ever since he was big enough to handle one, he had attained perfection in that line, and being always cool and resourceful.. ■-no matter how great the danger was that threatened hna, he made a name for himself as a terror to evildoers.
Wild had quite a little money at liis command, sinec he had been very successful in his mining ventures, iuut he chose to spend the greater part of his time in traveling about the wildest parts of the country in search of adventure.
TIitj two partners were like him in this respect, though they had not been born to lead, like he was.
And it was the same way with the girls they had with them. They always called them the girls, in speaking of th'*n>, though Anna, the wife of Cheyenne Charlie. " a young woman considerably past twenty.
But Eloise Gardner, the dark-eyed sweetheart Dart, was in her teens, like Arietta!
The outdoor life the girls had been leading for ‘flypast year or two had made them the picture of health, ai*1 though they had passed through many stirring ad ventures and had their lives in danger many times, the}' lov-‘ it.
But let us follow' Young Wild West and his partnei.. The young deadshot had come to Silver Shaft ft*”1® purpose of making some money at milling, either by '' ing out a claim or by speculation. ‘	, j
He did not mean that any gang of lawless men show stop him, and, since his life had already been aitenipje^ he wanted to find out just what kind of a place Si u Shaft was.	. I
One thing was certain, he had promisee] the Mine ^ to see her through 111 holding her mine, and if that going to put him in jeopardy he was ready to stand it.
The mining camp was a great deal like the other * zona mining camps theyhad visited.	.
Gambling and drinking were the two principal voca 1 ^ of the miners when they were not at work, and them would quit work almost at any time to do eithei. Wild and his partners went direct to the store. ^ It was still quite early in the morning, and man) the miners had not gone to their work.	>
As they passed a saloon that liad a big, red sign '*c ihe front, over the door, bearing the legend, l*et Saloon—Licensed Gambling House,” they saw wo » eyeing them with more than usual interest.
Wild recognized them right away as Con • •e>>vtl[ ^j.l one of bis men. "There are two oi them, boys, 0 ‘ f to his partners. "They are watching us pretty e osc reckon. Just let them try to show their hand an b thing will make them wish they had kept quie

YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE MINE GIRL.
The words wore scarcely out of his mouth -when a rough \oiee exclaimed:
“Hey, there, Young Wild West! You’re wanted fur shootin’ a man!”
‘“Is that so?” the young.deadshot answered, coolly, and ih‘-n he started straight for the saloon, followed by Cheyenne Charlie and Jim Dart.
CHAPTER III.
WILD DOES A .LITTLE SHOOTING.
There were about a dozen men in and outside of the Red Saloon, and as the Champion Deadshot of the West came up, followed by his two partners, they crowded to get a glimpse of them.
There was no doubt but that some one in the crowd had recognized our hero, and had made his name'known, otherwise Con Decker would not have called out to him that way.
It was surely the leader of the quartette whoohad called him, and Wild" was aware of it.
Decker stood right before the op^n door of the saloon, and when he saw the boy and his partners coming he turned slightly p'ale.
It was evident that lie had thought they would pay no attention'to.the call.
“Where is the man I shot?” Young Wild West demanded, as he faced the crowd and laid his hand on the butt of a revolver.
“Where would he be?” answered one, with a sneer. “He’s dead!”
“You lie!” exclaimed the young deadshot, coolly. “The nearest I came to shooting a galoot to-day was when I grazed the arm of the fellow who tried to pop me over from ambush a little while ago. I didn’t shoot to kill when I fired, but if I had you can bet all you re worth lie would have dropped for good! Now, you just step out here and fight. When I tell a man he lies, 1 expect him to fight! Come on, now !”
The boy had his revolver in his hand now, and the look in his eyes told plainly that he meant business.
The man who was challenged was a big, raw-boned fellow, with a cast in one of his eyes.
He was dirty and unkempt, and looked more like a tramp than anything else.
He looked at Con Decker, as though he expected him to interfere in his behalf, but that worthy remained strangely silent just then.
Perhaps it was. because Cheyenne Charlie and Jim Dart were watching him very closely.
“I—I don’t want ter fight, young feller,” faltered the man. “I jest answered your question, that's all. If yer shot a man he must be dead. Ain't that right?”
“No, that isn t right. The galoot I shot ai isn’t dead. I just grazed his arm with a bullet. The next time I shoot at him ho will be dead, though, and don’t you forget it! But you come out here. You thought you were pretty smart, but I am going to show you how deceived
you were. Come out here, or I'll shoot the buckle cli your hat, 3rou big galoot!”
The man stood partly inside the barroom of the saloon.
There was a thin leather strap about the hat he wore, which was fastened with a buckle on the side.
Seeing that he did not move. Young Wild West made sure that there was no one standing directly behind him. and then he took a quick aim with the revolver he had in his hand and pulled the trigger.
Crack!”
The buckle flew from the hat and the strap fell down.
“Now will you come out, you sneaking coyote?”
A low murmur of surprise went up from the men standing around.
That was shooting some, and they knew it.
“Keep, your hand away from that shootercautioned Cheyenne Charlie, as Con Decker made a move to pull his revolver. “If yer don't want ter die, stand right where ver are!”
If ever there were a lot of men astonished it was surely that particular crowd in front of the’Red Ink Saloon.
Something was happening that had never before taken place in the mining camp, and it was a mere boy who was causing it!
, “Come out here!” called out Young Wild West, and the man who had just lost the buckle from his hat obeyed.
“Don’t: shoot ag’in!” he cried. “Yer might make a mistake an’ drop me.”
“I never make a mistake,” was the cool retort. “'Get out 'in the road here. I am going to show you fellows what a little fancy shooting is like.”
“That’s right!” spoke up the scout. “Young Wild West, ther Champion Deadshot of ther West, will now give yer a little exhibition. Don’t no one git excited over^ it, fur if v.er do yer might run right in ther way of a chunk of hot lead. Whoopee ! Whoopee ! Wow !”
The scout edged up close to Con Decker then, and the first thing the villain knew he was seized by the collar and pulled out clear of the crowd.
“You’re ther sneakin’ galoot what was goin’ ter take ther claim away from ther Mine Gal, are yer?" he cried. “You ain’t fit ter live, an’ everybody what knows yer believes it, if they would speak ther truth. Jest you stand right there, an if yer lay your hands on your gun vou’ll turn up your toes in a jiffy ! You hear what I sav ! Wow ! Wow!”
The scout was right in the humor for a scrimmage now, and if Young Wild West had not spoken to him there is no telling just how far he would have gone.
But a word from the boy and he became suddenly silent.
Jim Dart never had a great deal to say, but as a watcher there was none-better.
He seemed to be watching the whole crowd at one time, and the least hostile move one of them made would f*tal his doom, for the boy seldom missed when he fired.
The big, raw-boned man walked slowly until he got into the middle of the sandy street that ran through the mining camp.
All eyes turned upon him when Young Wild West ordered him to hold up his right foot.
“What do yer want me to do that tur?” the rascal asked.
YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE MINE GIRL.
“Never mind. Go on and hold it up,” came tlie reply.' Up wentf the foot.
Crack 1
■ A piece of the heel was clipped oft as clean as a whistle.
"Now tlie other foot.”
Crack!
Wild fired the moment the foot was raised, and off went a piece of leather from the boot heel.
‘‘'Now', then, gentlemen,” said the young deadshot, coolly, looking at the crowd, “I want $o show you how easy I can drop a scoundrel, in ease I feel like doing it. Most any one can hit a silver quarter with a rifle, but I am going to take a shot at one with my six-shooter. This ma* is going to hold it for me, too!”
“Not much, I ain't!” exclaimed the ruffian, for he was nothing more, and one of the close friends of Con Decker, at that. 1
“Yes, you are! You are going^to do just as I tell you to, so don’t say you won't. You wanted to get a shot at me in the ■worst way, and I wouldn't let you, so now I am going to make an example of you. But I will tell you one thing—I am not going to hurt you in the least just now, providing 3*ou stand perfectly still. If you move the fraction of an inch, and happen to get a bullet througl: some part of you, it will be your own fault.”
“I’ve got enough, young feller.”
“You may have, but I haven’t.”
“I ll ’pologize fur what I said a little while ago.”
“It isn't necessary. I won’t accept an apology from any such a galoot as you are. Have you got a silver quarter about you?”
“No,” replied the man,* showing how uneasy he was by shifting his feet from one side to the other.
“Well, here is one, then. - Just hold it between your thumb and forefinger, and the more steady you are in doing it the better it will be for your fingers.”
Wild tossed the coin to him, and he caught it, because he was afraid it might go hard with him if he did not.
‘‘Hold it up, so I can get a good shot at it. If your hand is steady I’ll knock it out of your fingers and not touch them; if it is not I won’t say what will happen,” said our hero, as the man looked at his frk-nds, helplessly.
But not one of them offered to help him out by word or sign.
They were all interested, however, and when they saw tlie villain take the coin and hold it out, some of them actually held their breath.
“'Steady, now!” called out the young deadshot, as he stopped back, so he was about ten paces from the man.
Then his revolver went up over his head and came down until it was on a line with the silver quarter. Crack!
The sharp report rang out and (he coin flew from the man’s fingers, landing on the grouud nearly twenty feet distant.
A cheer went up from some of the miners.
Thor wore not all friends of Con Decker, and they now realized that they had a boy in their midst who could do things, nt> well as say them.
“You're all right, Young Wild West!” one of them ailed out.
“I am glad you think so,” was the reply. “I always try to mind my own business, but sometimes 1 have to miml omebody else’s in order to mind my own. There are ome galoots in this camp who would like to make me a subject for the undertaker, and I don't propose that they shall. Now, then, you big galoot, go and pick up that quarter, and keep it to remember me. Every time you look at it just think how much your life would be worth if I drew a bead on you! I guess that will be about all for the present.”
Just then the two Chinamen our hero had in his employ as cook and all-around worker came in sight. ' -They were brothers, looking much alike, and their names were Hop Wrali and Wing Wah.
The latter was the cook and he looked meek enough as he came along, leading the pack horse that was to convey the goods they purchased up to the camp.
His brother’s face wore a smile that was “childlike and bland,” and to look at him 110 one would have guessed that he was one of the most clever sleight-of-hand performers and card sharps that ever crossed the Pacific. But he was, just the same, as will be seen later on.
CHAPTER IV.
“A VELLY MUCJTEE SMARTEE CHINEE.”
It so happened that there were no Chinamen in mining camp of Silver Shaft until the arrival of the t" just described.
WThen the miners saw them they set up a yell.	•,
“Here they come, boys!” called out tlie man who told our he ro that he was all right. “I thought it could11 ^ last much longer! What is a minin* camp without a heathens in it? Whoopee! Hooray!”	..c
It was evident that the miners did not know that ^ two Celestials belonged to the party of'Young Wild W ^ J for they at once made a run for them and surrouu
them.	lilY
But it was not for the purpose of doing them any boc
liarm‘	. 1 A mii*c
Anyhow, the bad ones kept back, they having nacl (1
enough from Young Wild West.
Young Wild “West and his partners said not a ^r.
until they saw one of the miners going a little too
by trying to make the pack horse run away fr°nj
Chinaman, who was holding on for all he was worth.
Then it was that our hero called out:	. ^
“Ilold on! That pack horse belongs to us. We
to use him to take some provisions to camp. Dont m
him run away.”
The miner ceased his antics instantly.
"All right, Young Wild West,” he answered. ^
didn’t know ther horse was yourn; we thought ther
heathens had struck here all by themselves. If the*
k yourn, maybe ther Chinamen is, too?”
“Well, they work for us.”
“Oh!”
YOUNG WILD WEST
That altered the case.
The cook hastily got the horse away from tlie crowd, but Hop, his brother, chose to linger there.
“Hip hi !” he yelled. “Me allee samee Mclican man! Me um bull}' boy with urn glassy eye!”
Then he did a few steps of a jig, and a roar of laughter went up from the crowd.
This was a great deal more than they expected from such an innocent looking heathen.
Con Decker and his friends had worked their way inside the saloon by this time.
But they were looking out of the door and window and taking in the scene, with frowns on their brows.
Hap Morton, the man who had been shot in the arm by the Mine Girl, had his arm. in a sling, and the fellow Wild had grazed with a bullet wore a piece of sticking plaster just below his right elbow.
The other man of the quartette stood at the side of the big, raw-boned fellow, who had held up the quarter for Wild to shoot at.
He belonged to the gang, though he had not been with Decker when he tried to make Sallie Bacon turn the mine over to thpm.
“What'll strike here next. Con?” Hap Morton said, as he watched the dancing Chinaman. “That heathen don’t look as though he knows enough ter go in when it rains. But there seems ter be lots of fun in him, jest ther same. Hanged if that ain’t worth laughin’ at!”
“Well, go on an’ laugh, if yer want ter; but I ain’t roin’ fer laugh at anything that Young Wild West has got ter do with. Ther young galoot is altogether too smart, an’ I hate him like p’ison!”
“Well, I reckon we all hate him, fur that matter. Any one as interferes with us in our line of business is bound ter be hated by us. That goes without sayin’. But that ain’t got nothin’ ter do with a comical Chinaman, though. Hello! Ther heathen galoot is coinin’ in here.”
Sure enough, Hop Wah was coming into the saloon.
One of the failings that the clever Chinaman had was a love for tanglefoot, as he called whisky.
But he was wise enough not to drink too much when anything like danger was lurking near, however.
Another great failing was that he loved to gamble, and had a fascination for cheating.
He could do this without being caught, for his sleight-, of-hand propensities enabled him to handle a deck of
cards about as he pleased.
“Dlaw pokee,” as he called the great American gambling gam°, was his favorite.
Hop let his brother go on to the store, and took the chance to come into the saloon.
He did riot know whether lie would he called back by Young Wild West, and when he found that he was not
hi8 face was all smiles.
But our hero had not called him hack because he wanted to see how the bad men would act toward the Chinaman.
IIo know pretty well that Hop was able to take caie of himself, even though he was no fighter.
11 is cleverness and affected innocence usually goc him out of trouble.
“-Ale likee havee lillce tanglefoot,” said the Chinaman,
AND THE MINE GIRL.
as he stepped up to the ricketty bar of the Red Ink Saloon in a hesitating sort of way.
But the hesitation was only assumed, for Hop was no more afraid to come in there than he was to go in a Chinese store in ’Frisco.
“You’d like ter have a little tanglefoot, eh?” replied the man behind the bar, who was the proprietor himself, an ex-miner, who thought there was more money to be made selling whisk}* than digging for gold.
Ted Blight was his name, and though he was fairly honest, he did not hesitate to take the last dollar a man had for a drink of whisky.
“Me likee tanglefoot velly muchee,” said Hop, as he laid down a silver dollar.
“All right; help yourself. Your money is jest as good as a white man's, I reckon.” v	+
Hop smiled and poured out his drink.
“You washce-washee for Young Wild West, John?” asked one of the miners, with a grin on his bronzed face.
“Mo no washee! me no namee John,” was the quick reply.
“Oh, all right, then. What is your name?”
“Me namee Hop Wah; comee ilom China; me velly smartee Chinee.”
“Is'that so? What are yer smart about?’* and the miner winked at his companions.
“You gottee fivee dollee bill?" queried the Chinaman, smiling blandly.
“I reckon I have,” was the reply.
“Me bette you fivee dollee me velly smartee man. len." “How are yer goin’ ter prove it?” asked the miner, as he produced a bill of the denomination Hop calkd for.
“Me lettee um Melican mans prove it velly quiekee. A on puttee uppee you money, so be.”
There was a laugh at this, for, somehow, the miners thought something funny was going to happen.
“Put up or shet up, Bill!" exclaimed Ted Blight, the saloon keeper.
“Oh, I'll put un, all right. Yer heard what he .-aid, didn't yer? He's goin’ ter leave it tor all hand;; ter prove whether lie's smart or not.’’
“Yes, vv-c understand that, I reckon.”
Hop put down a five-dollar bill and Bill quickly cov.nvd it with his.
Then Hop drew a big, yellow Hlk handkerchief ir-nn lr's pocket and carefully spread it over the two bill* on t he counter.
“What are yer doin’ that fur?*’ Bill a.skod.
“Ale wantee cover nm money goodee, so be.”
“Oli, I pee! Well, go ahead an' let ther gang decide whether you're a smart heathen ov not.”
“Me puttee uppee mn fivo-dflK- geld piece and you puttee upp<\* livec one dolee bills, so hi ?"
“Oh, 1 reckon you know what wo both put v.p.”
“Ale puttee fivee dollee cr*»1<I piece o’> nm bar and yo;i pi!tec fivee one dollee bills lere. Me askee \..\i von havee fivee dollee bill, and yoa say ye*; but wu puii.ee Yippee fivee one dollee bills, allot samee.”
"Are yer eittin' crazy. Ueaihe.u?” said Bill, looking at him in amazement.
‘‘Me no gittee clazy. you gittee cla/.y. Mb cover um
YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE MINE GIRL.
money with um handkelchief, and me knowee lat um five dollee gold piece and fivee one dollee bills lere.”
‘•'And everybody in ther room knows that there ain’t. I'll leave it ter any one here if I didn’t put up a five-dollar bill!”
"That’s right,” came from several.
IIop looked at them with affected surprise.
"You no see velly muchee goodee lis morning, so be,” he remarked.
Then he lifted the handkerchief.
Exclamations of .amazement went up from those stand-in w near.
O
Just as the Chinaman had declared, there was a iive-dollar gold piece there.
But there were five one-dollar bills, too!
The two five-dollar bills had vanished, and the other money had replaced them.
"Me velly smartee Chinee, so be,” said the clever Celestial as he counted over the money and placed it in his pocket.
"That’s right!” exclaimed Ted, the saloon keeper. "You lose, Bill!”
"That's right !” chorused several of the bystanders.
Bill shook his head.
“That beats anything I ever seen!” he declared. "But I ain’t no squealer, Ther heathen wins ther bet, I s’pose. I'd jest like ter know how ther money got changed, though.”
“Me no undelstand,” said Hop, shaking his head.
"I reckon you understand all right,” observed Ted. “You’re a whole lot smarter than yer look ter be. Ha, ha, ha!”
The laugh was on Bill, and he took it good naturedly.
CHAPTER V.
THE SECRET BAND OF SILVER SHAFT.
Young Wild West and Cheyenne Charlie came into tlie saloon just then.
They had left Jim Dart and the cook at the supply store to get what was needed, while they came in to sec how IIop was making out.
Con Decker no sooner saw them than he said something in a whisper to one of hi6 men, and then he got up and went out, using the rear door, which showed that he was afraid to get too close td the young deadshot.
The result was that all the bad gang left the saloon in less than five minutes after the leader went out.
“Well, boy's,” said Decker, as they met a little later at his shanty, which was only a short distance from the heart of the mining camp, "I reckon somethin' has got tor be done. Yer all know by this time that we can’t expect ter do anything here unless we work in secret. You've seen enough fur that, I reckon. Now that this meddlesome boy is here, we’ve got a fight on hand, and ther only way fur us ter win out is ter organize a secret band, same as I belonged ter oncc in LeadviHo. Ther roost, of ther men is ag in us here, so we won t stand no show, unless we kin git a few more members to ther gang.
Ordinary members won’t do, ’cause they’ll go back on yer at ther first time they git in a.hole. What we want is a band that won’t break! Each member must be sworn ter stick to it, no matter if they gits killed fur it. They musn’t tell nothin' that would give away ther rest, not if they die fur it. Now, then, how many of you is in favor of organizin’ a secret band in Silver Shaft?”
There were four of them there, besides himself, they all spoke at once, declaring themselves in favor of his suggestion.
They were all ignorant men, and the thought of organizing themselves into a secret band made them think that they would really be invincible to any enemies who mig^ choose to go against them.
Con Decker nodded with undisguised pleasure.
"Good!” he exclaimed. "I like ter see things unanimous, I do! I’ll git ter work right away witli ther organization business. Ther band shall be run ther same way ther one I belonged ter did. In ther first place, yer a president, which is what we had, an’ he was ther leader. IIow will I do fur that?”	..
Once more the four were unanimous. They wantec him, of course, for they all recognized the fact that nc had a better set of brains than any of them had.
This might not be stating much, but it was undoubted!) true.
But Con Decker never made use of his brains to thui ^ of anything that would benefit his fellow-man. He been reared mostly with people who were dishonest, he was like them.
His past had been one of crime all through, and he ha survived!
When he came to Silver Shaft he had eojne with the avowed purpose to live from the earnings of others, aui he had succeeded pretty well, so far, and without being caught in taking what did not belong to him.,	,
Bacon’s mine offered him the best inducement to £e rich quick, and for the past two days he had been schem iug to got possession of it.	■ .
He had tried all ways to induce the Mine Girl to e-him take charge of it, and that morning he had desperate and tried to take possession by force, regardless of what might happen afterward.
But just as he had things all his own way a mere ^ appears on the scene and gives him the greatest ca his life.	. .jj(r
Having been regarded as a sort of terror in the nnnu -camp, this was certainly humiliating.
But Con Decker was nothing if not of a revengeful c *• position.	i
He meant to put an end to Young Wild West, ^ that was one reason why he wanted to organize the sed band.	^
“Just look outside and make sure that there is n0_ . r listening,” said Docker. "Since you' are all satisfies ^ me to be president of the organization, I will sweai „ in as members.”
One of the villains wrerit out and looked around. ^ There was no one near, so he came back and TeP°
(<> that effect.
“Well,” went on the loader, "before we proceed fur _ I will number yon. I will bo Number One, of course.
m
YOUNG WILD WEST. AND THE MINE GIBL.
9
Morton will be Number Two. That makes him next to me in command. The rest of you will draw lots for places. That's fair and square. I’ve only selected my lieutenant, you see.”
“That’s puffectly fair, Con,” said the man Young Wild West had grazed with a bullet. “1 reckon we’re all satisfied ter that, ain't we, bo}rs?”
‘‘Yes,” the other two answered.
Then they drew lots and it was soon settled.
“Now, Con, what's next?” asked Number Three.
“Jest stand up there, facin’ each other,” was the reply. The four villains obeyed.
“Draw your shooters, men!”
This they did, wondering what was coming.
“Put ther muzzles ag’iu ther hearts of each other an’ stand ready ter shoot when I count three.”
Then there was some little hesitation.
“Do as I say. Maybe I won’t count three, you know.” They understood, and a sigh of relief went up.
Decker now pulled a revolver from his belt and placed tiie muzzle against his temple.
“Jest repeat ther oath I say, boys,” he said.
Then followed an oath, which though taken in a crude way, was horrible and binding.
It bound tlie little band together, with the death penalty for one who should prove a traitor.
“That’s good, boys,” said the leader of the band, when tbo oath had been taken. “Now 1 feel that we’re goin’ ~?-l' make a success. I know that there ain't one of yer what will go back on me. But we must have about live more members. Git ’em as soon as yer kin, boys. We’ll hold a meetin' to-night, an’ if there’s any candidates they shall be initiated. Be mighty careful who yer let know anything about it, for if yer happen ter ask any one, an’ he refuses, lie’s got ter die. Dead men tell no tales, yer know. 1 reckon that’ll be ther motto of our band—‘Dead men tell no tales!’ ”	\
“I know one I kin git, what kin be depended on, too,”
spoke up Number Five.
“So do I know one,” chimed in Number Three.
“An’ I know two what would be mighty glad ter jine us,” Hap Morton said.
“Well, I know one, myself,” added the leader. “Tom Pike, ther galoot what jest escaped bein’ lynched ther other day by ther skin of his teeth, will be mighty glad tor jine. I reckon. If it hadn’t been fur me swearin’ ter a lie ter save him he’d have got it sure. 1 didn’t know whether he killed ther old miner or not, but 1' swore that he was with me up in ther woods, huntin’ fur a bear when ther killin’ was done. He wasn’t, of course, an’ it are most likely that he killed ther old galoot, jest ter git hold of ther gold he was s’posed ter have hid in his shanty *t>mewheres. I ain’t never said anything ter him about it, nor him ter me; but I'll see him afore ther day is over, an’ have a little talk with him.”
They talked it over further, and it was finally decided that they would start in the business of secretly robbing the miners as soon as they had the required number in the band.
Hut they had two other objects in view at Hie same I time.	i
» One was to get possession of Sallie Bacon's mine, and the other was to rid the world of Young Wild West.
They waited until they saw* our liero and his partners go away with the two Chinamen and the loaded pack horse and then they started in to do some missionary work.
The result was that they got just five of the worst men in the camp to agree to join the band, not one refusing after he had been given a hint of what it meant to join.
The probabilities are -that they could have got as many more if they had tried, but Con Decker declared that ten was enough.
That night the candidates met with them at the shanty of Decker and they were duly initiated in the same way that the others took the oath, only Decker added a little more to the ceremony.
The new ones were numbered by lot, and they appeared to be well satisfied.
“There’s one thing you fellers must always remember,” the leader said to them, when the initiation was over. “If one of yer ever happens ter git caught fur stealing or fur doin’ anything else what some says is wrong, yer must never let it be known that yer belong ter our band. If yer do yer won’t live very long. That’s somethin’ yer kin gamble on!”
“An’ we've all got ter do as our leader says, unless lie tells us somethin’s got ter be done what's impossible/' spoke up Number Two.
“That’s it!” exclaimed Decker. “But I reckon yer all know that, though.”
“Sartin we do,” said one of the new members. “What's a leader fur, if it ain’t ter lead? What he says has got ter go.”
“An’ if yer don’t like ther leader two-thirds of ther band kin call fur an election an’ ’lect another one,” spoke up Decker, knowing pretty well that {hev would not think of doing such a thing as that.
“What are we goin’ ter call ourselves, Con?” Hap Morton asked, after a pause.
“We'll jest call ourselves what we are, which is ther Secret Band of Silver Shaft,” was the reply. “But. that, ain't fur outsiders ter know, an’ if we hear any one mentionin’ it we'll know that some one has slipped somethin’ that he ought not ter, which will mean that we’ve got a traitor in our midst.”
“I reckon we'd better start right in an' do some business to-night,” Number Nine suggested. “I'm putty nigh broke, an I know where I kin make a haul of about a thousand in gold to-night, if I kin have ther help of one or two of ther brothers.”
“I reckon yer kin have all ther help yer want,” replied the leader. I'll app’iut two ter help yer. Docs any one else know of anything what kin be done to-night?”
Some of them did, and when they had arranged things the meeting broke up.
0HATTER VI.
THE MINK 01UL OKI'S A .MAN TO HELP HER.
Young W ild West did not remain very long in the saloon.
As soon as Jim Part and the rook had finished niak-
10
YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE MINE GIRL.
ing tlie purchases at the store he was ready to go back and shilt the camp to the claim belonging to the Mine Girl.
Hop did not seem to want to go witli tliem, but our hero insisted on it, knowing that if he v;as left there he would not be on hand to help his brother witll the work.
They soon got Lack, and then their outiit was carried over to the claim that had been left to Sallic Bacon by her father.
It was an ideal spot to camp, far it overlooked the group cf shanties and tents in the little valley below, and everything was there that thoy could need in the shape of water, fuel and fodder for the horses.
Then it was so close to the mining carnp that a trip to the store and back could be made in less than ten minutes.
The Mine Girl pointed out her shanty, which was only a couple of hundred yards from the mine, and was built on the slope.
The hill was very steep right ihere, and it looked as though it would not require much to start ilie little shanty rolling down the hill.
“’It looks as though yer <ir.& was pickin’ out about tlier worst place he couM -inr] when he put tha= shanty there,” observed Cheyenne Charlie. a;; ho took a good look at it.
“Well, one side of it is held up by a big rock,” replied Sallie. "So long as the rock don't move the shanty won't, unless a cyclone hits it, and we don’t have such things around here. Dad built the shanty before he staked out this claim. He was doin’ nothing but prospecting just then, and lie wanted a place to live in. so 1 could keep house for him. The Government owns that land, and I suppose somebody will be coming along pretty soon and taking possession of it. Then, if I can’t sell the shanty, 1*11 have to move it.”
“It wouldn't be much trouble ter move it down ther hill,” said the scout, with a chuckle. “But I reckon it would be a putty hard job ter git it up here.”
“I would not think of living in the shanty, after what happened this morning,” spoke up Arietta, who was listening to the conversation. “Those men would not hesitate to kill you, in order to get possession of your mine. You had better move your effects up here and camp with us. You could easily hire some men to take the shanty apart and get it up here, too, if you wanted to.”
“I guess I will move up here/’ the girl replied. “But 1 11 leave the shanty alone for a while. 'I want to get eome one at work in the mine, for I have no ready cash to do anything with. Young Wild West, will you see about getting me a couple of men to go to work, and will 3rou look after things for a day or two, until I get things pr,ingr I know a lot about mining, because my father taught me: hut I am not good at managing men.”
“Wait till yer git married. Then you’ll soon learn hovr.'’ Charlie remarked, as he looked at his wife and grinned.
There was a laugh at this, and the girl blushed.
"That something i have never thought of yet,” she s?nid.
“You’ll think of ii when ther right fuller eomcs along,” the scout assured her.	•
None of tjhem had any idea that the right fellow was coming along that very evening, but such was the case.
When the stage coach caine in that night at dusk among its passengers was a young man named Dick Brvan.
Wild and Charlie were at the store when the stage coach drove up, and it just happened that Bryan came to them in search of information.
“1 am a stranger here,” he said. “But I am not exactly new to mining camps. I’ve been knocking around from place to place for the past six months, and I haven't made enough to keep me without work a month. I want to strike a job with some one, and I'll do a little prospecting between times. You don't know where I could find work around here, do you?”
Young Wild West had been sizing up the young man as he talked, and he came to the conclusion that he was an honest and industrious fellow.
It struck him right away that he would be a good one to put at work in Sallie Bacon’s mine.
“I reckon we might find something for you to do, if you know the difference between pay-dirt and > sand/’ he answered.
“Good!” and the young man’s face lighted up. “I have learned quite a little since 1 have been on the hunt for gold, though I can’t say that I have ever run across much pay-dirt while I have been working on my own hook. I will do my best to suit you if you will give me a trial.”
“All right. lrou can go up to our camp with us. Tha~r is no use in spending your money for a lodging at one of the whiskv-mills here. They charge high prices, and the chances are that you would have to sleep on a board, at that. We are going over in a few minutes, so get your belongings together and wait for us.”
“My belongings don’t amount to much,” and Dick Bryan smiled, as he gazed at the rather dilapidated grip lie had, placed on the ground when lie came up and addressed them. “All I’ve got is what I have got on, and what is in that bag.”
“Well, you could be worse off.”
Then they stood there and watched the newcomers until they had drifted off in search of placcs to stop for the night.
There were only about half a dozen, all told, and the most of them appeared to be miners.
Wild thought it a little strange that none of. the villains were around among the crowd.
fie did not know that they were busy just then perfecting the organization they had started that day.
After a while Wild and Charlie told Dick Brvan to come on, and then they headed up the hill for the camp, where a fire could he seen burning, like a beacon light for. them.
Wild had not spoken to any of the men in regard to going to work for the Mine Girl, because he had not come across any that suited him for the purpose, who were likely to accept the position.
The majority, of them bad claims of their own, and those who did wore not very ambitious, to say the least.
When the three reached (lie camp those waiting there were surprised to see the stranger.
Wild quickly introduced him, and then he added:
YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE MINE GIEL.
n
“I think I am a pretty good student of character in a person’s face, and the moment 1 saw this young man I made up my mind that he would be a good one to help work the mine here. Sallie, if you say the word he shall have a trial?”
“It is for you to say the ■word,” she answered. “I left it to you, you know.”
“I’ll do my best to suit you, Miss Bacon,” Bryan spoke up.
“Don’t call me Miss Bacon; I don’t like it. Call me Sallie, please.”
The girl was rather blunt in her wa3's, but she meant what she said, every time.
Dick Bryan proved to be a pretty good conversationalist after he got acquainted, and he told of his struggles to become rich sincc he was a mere boy, winding up by saying:
“And I am not a bit nearer to it than I was at the time when I started out. But I am going to stick to mining for a while ydt.”
“You stick to me and you’ll get rich, all right,” the Mine Girl remarked. “My mine is worth a lot of money, and if you understand the business you can work it on shares for me. Then we’ll both be rich before long.”
“This, seems too good to be true,” and Bryan shook his head, as though he could hardly believe it. “I fell asleep coming over in the stage coach, and I got to dreaming how I landed here and struck it rich. But I soon awoke, when the rickety, old stage coach gave a jolt, and ^thei) I found it was only a dream. I wonder if I am not ' dreaining now ?”
“No, you are not dreaming. I know what I am talking about when I say my mine is worth a lot of money. That is the reason Con Decker and his gang want to get hold of it.”
Young Wild West was well satisfied that Dick Bryan would be just the right man for the position, even if his knowledge about mining was limited.
He was ready to bet that the young man was honest and a good worker, and that meant a whole lot.
As the evening waned Bryan and Sallie became much better acquainted, and Cheyenne Charlie; who always took notice of such things, declared that if things kept on the way they had started there would he a partnership existing between them before very long.
They saw or heard nothing of Con Decker and his gang that night, and when morning dawned they arose and had breakfast, and were then ready to go to work.
The work that Young Wild West had on hand just then was to get things started right in the mine.
He did not propose to take anything for his services, but hoped to get hold of a claim by luck or purchase.
He was not ready to buy anything that was offered to him, however, for he was too well used to mining to be caught.
He went into the mine with the Mine girl and the rest, and when he saw what was there he nodded his head ap-- provingly.
“I reckon this is all right,” he said. “Your father left it in gopd shape, and it won’t require very much work to get the pav-dirt out. You have a regular mint here, iSallie.”
“Well, I don't want to sell out just yet/' the girl answered. “I want to get money enough to keep me comfortable when 1 go to 'Frisco.”
The derrick and other crude machinery there was amply sufficient to work the mine,, for it was not more than thirty feet deep. All the hard work—work that paid little or nothing—had been done by the girl’s father.
CHAPTER VII.
WHAT WILD JIEARD IN THE WOODS.
“Well,” said Wild, when ho had looked the mine over pretty well, “I reckon everything is all right now. All you want is a couple of men to work for you, providing you want to get the gold that is here out in a hurry.” “Well, I am not in such an awful hurry about it,” answered the Mine Girl. “So long as we can get out. enough to make it pay well, I sha’n’t bother to hire any one else just now. I am going to give Dick Bryan half of what is made here. He does the work and I furnish the mine.*’ “That is altogether too much,” spoke up Bryan. “I am willing, to work for much less than, that.”
“Well, as long as I am satisfied you ought to be,” she replied.
“But I am not entitled to any such offer as that.” “Well, you don't know what kind of men we have got here in Silver Shaft. The chances are if I hired some of them to work for me I would get a great deal less than half. Con Decker wanted to work the mine and give me a third of what was made. That meant that I wouldn't get anything at all after he had been running things a while. I am satisfied that you are all right, Dick Bryan. You now have the show to make the fortune you have been looking for so long—that is, if it is to be made here.” “Well, you will never have cause to regret taking me in on an equal share with you, I hope. I am going to do the best I can.”
“Look out yer don’t fall in love with ther gal,” admonished Charlie. “If 3*er go ter doin’ anything like that, an’ she sorter likes it, yer won’t git much dust out.” They both blushed, and Bryan managed to stammer out something that sounded like “Nonsense!”
But there was no nonsense about it, and the scout knew it.
He was a pretty keen observer in such matters, and had been ever since he fell in love with Anna.
He was always trying to help along love affairs, too, and nothing would please him better than to see the two fall in love with each other.
Jim offered to help Bryan until he got things started, and when nine o’clock came they had taken out at least? five hundred dollars worth of gold in small nuggets and dust.
The Mine Girl said that her father had made a big blast in the mine a couple of days before he died, and that he had not been able to ascertain just what the results were.
]l« had been stricken the same day with an old moladv

that had bothered him for years, and this time the attack carried him off in a hurry.
While Jim was helping the young man, who had fallen into such a good position so suddenly, Wild and Charlie decided to go out and look for some game.
There ought to be plenty of game on the mountainside. by the appearance of it, and as they were about out of everything in the line of fresh meat, they felt that a deer would not be a very bad proposition, providing it was young and tender.
Leaving the girls at the camp near the shaft of the mine, they took their rifles and started away to the left.
They were keeping their eyes open for human game, as well as the four-footed kind, and they had not gone far when they saw two men following them.
Though they could not see them well enough to {ell who they were, they easily guessed that they belonged to Con Decker’s crowd.
“Now, then, Charlie,” said our hero, “I want you to keep right on going through the woods. I will wait here and try and find out what those fellows are up to. If you see anything in the line of game go and shoot it, if it is nothing more than a quail that you start. Wait for me over at that blasted pine the other side of the gully, will join you there, unless something extraordinary happens to me.”
“All right, Wild. I understand exactly. I’ll wait there an’ if I see anything ter shoot on ther way I’ll shoot, jest ther same as though I never thought there was anything in ther line of a bad galoot around these diggin’s.”
The scout started off and Wild dropped behind a clump of bushes and waited.
It was not more than five minutes before he heard footsteps.
Then he heard low voices.
The next minute the two men he had seen following them appeared.
One of them was the man he had given the fright to when he shot the quarter from his hand, and the other was one he had seen at the saloon at the time he gave the exhibition.
As luck would have it, the two villains halted within a dozen feet of the clump of* bushes Wild was hiding lie-hind.
“I guess we'd belter give ’em a chance ter git a little further nwav, Tom,” said one of them, speaking in a low tone of voice. “It looks as though they was out after gam<;, an' they might go a little slow. We can’t see ’em from here, ’cause there's too many trees an’ bushes in ther way. But it won’t he no trouble tor locate ’em, 'cause they'll be doin’ some shootin’ putty soon.”
“That’s right,” was the reply. “Now if we kin only manage ter pop ’em over, an’ then chuck their bodies in a hole somewhere, so they won't he found, we’ll be doin’ somethin’ great. Tt will be a big thing fur ther Secret of Silver-Shaft, all right.”
“Hush! Don’t say that so loud, Tom. We don’t want a livin’ soul ter know there’s such a thing as a secret band in these diggin’s.”
"Well, I reckon there ain’t no one here ter hear us, unless it is ther trees,” the man retorted, with a low chuckle. “By jingo! But it was slick work that we doue
last night, wasn’t it?. We must have hauled in about three thousand in cash, besides ther gold dust we got hold of. There ain’t a man what kin lay s'picion on us, either, ’cause they don’t know that there is sich a thing as a Secret Band here. We belong ter ther Secret Band of Silver Shaft, all right: an’ I, fur one, am mighty proud of it.” “Yer ought ter bo proud. It’s ther greatest thing what ever happened ter us. Con says that if wc kin only git Young Wild West an* his pards out of ther way we'll have plain sailin’ here in Silver Shaft. Con seems ter be a lit tie afraid of that boy.”
“Why wouldn’t he bo? Look what ther boy has done ter him! Why, if he ain’t stopped he'll have us all on ther run in no time. Yer kin bet that I’ll lay him low putty quick, if 1 kin only git close enough an’ clrnw a bead on him!”
“That’s right. Jest keep in mind what our motto is all ther time, ‘Dead men tells no tales’ is what it is, an’ ther same thing applies ter meddlesome boys.”
“ ‘Dead men tells no tales,’ that’s right,” and the other villain laughed as he said it.
Young Wild West also laughed, but neither of them heard him.
Not that he was afraid to let them hear him, for he would not have minded it in the least to get up and confront them right then and there.
But the young deadshot wanted to hear all he could from them.
Already he had learned something of great importance, and he wanted to learn more.	,pr
But the two villains did not choose to talk any more about the Secret Band just then.
Their conversation was on what they would do if they managed to get close enough to make sure work of Young Wild West and his partner.
“One thing about it,” said the man called Toin,. “if we do any shootin’ their friends won’t think nothin of it* 'cause they’ll think it’s them pluggin’ away at some game.”
“That's right,” answered the other.
“S’pose we go on now?”
“All right.”
Then they walked on through the woods, and when they got a short distance away Wild started softly afU> {hem.	,
The boy had not yet made up his mind what he woU ^ do with them; but there was one thing certain, and * 1‘* was if either of them raised a rifle to fire a shot at enne Charlie he would surely bring whichever it nu&1 be down.
The two members of the Secret Band had 8°^ more than a hundred yards, when they saw a Chinam* walking through the bushes.
It was Hop Wali, Young Wild West's clever ^'l1in:im|11^ Wild saw him at the same time, and ho wondered w l\ he was up to.	» n
But he soon guessed that he had sn caked a way 1 the camp and was taking a roundabout way to get down the saloons without being seen by Jim and the girl**- ^ The moment the two villains saw him they liastcnc ^ for him.

“Hello, Heathen!” one of them called out, softly. “Where are yer headin'' fur?”
“Ale allee samee go to um Led Ink Saloon to buy lillee tanglefoot,” was the truthful reply.
“Well, what are yer cornin’ away around this way fur, then ? You’re gittin’ ’way out of your latitude.”
“Me no wantee nobody see me, so be; me allee samee lun awav flom um camp.”
“Oh!”
Then they both laughed.
Tom whispered something to his companion, who gave a nod, and then they walked up to the Chinaman.
Suddenly the former villain pulled a revolver from his belt.
‘•'Don’t yer make a sound!” he exclaimed, pointing it at Hop’s head. “If yer do you’ll be a dead Chinee afore yer kin say Jack Robinson!”
“Me 110 say one lillee word,” answered Hop, growing very much frightened. “Me allee samee goodee Chinee, so be.”
There was some more whispering and nodding then, after which one of them said:
“Shell out what money you’ve got, Heathen!”
“Don’t you do it, Hop!”
As the startled villains turned they saw Young Wild AVest standing within a few feet of them, a revolver in either hand.
CHAPTER VIII.
T\VO GREAT SHOTS.
There was a smile on the handsome face of Young Wild West as the two men gazed at him, with drooping jaws.
“So you were going to rob the Chinaman, eh, you sneaking coyotes?” he said. “After you had done that I suppose you meant to kill him, too, so he couldn’t tell about it. Is tliat right?”
“Wo was only foolin’ with him, Young Wild West,” answered one of them, doing his best to appear calm. “A feller always does like ter play a joke on a Cliinee, yer know?”
“Yes, I know. But that was a pretty tough sort of a joke 3rou were going to play on him—robbing and then killing a man is a rather hard joke, I should say.”
“We never once thought about killin’ him,” protested the villain. “We ain’t in that line of business.”
“No, I suppose not. You are a couple of very honest men. I have reasons to believe that,” and the boy laughed to show that he meant just the contrary.
Wild thought a moment and decided that he would let the men go, but not until after he had given them a good scare.
“Kindly let your rifles fall to the ground,” he said, . speaking with mock politeness, r. The command was obeyed.
“Now, Hop, just take their shooters away from them,” lie went on, as he nodded to the Chinaman.
Ilop had recovered his usual manner by this time, and he quickly did as he was told.
Wild then stepped up and quickly emptied the rifles of the cartridges they contained.
They were not magazine rifles, so each only contained one cartridge.
This done, he handed them to the two villains, and said:
“Now I am going to show you some shooting that you never saw the like of before. While there is going to be nothing wonderful about it, when you come to think of it, it will make you feel a little bit queer, I think. You two galoots are going to help me in it, too. so you had better nerve yourselves for something you never did before in your lives.”
The}' both turned*pale.
They had heard that the boy was the Champion Dead-shot of the West, and they had seen enough the day before to convince them that he was; but the way he spoke made them think that he was going to try something that was a great deal worse than shooting a silver quarter out of a man’s fingers.
Wild was going to do something that seemed more diiFi-cult and dangerous than that.
Stepping away about twenty feet, he raised his rifle to his shoulder and exclaimed:
“Both of you aim directly at my head, just as though you meant to shoot me!”
“What do yer mean?” Tom gasped.
“Just what I say. Go ahead. If you don’t hold jrour rifles perfectly steady you will surely get shot. Do as I say!”
“Wha—what are yer goin’ ter do?” asked the other, falteringly.
“ I am going to flatten a bullet in each breech of .your rifles.”
Both men began to tremble.
“Here! That won’t do. I want to make sure when I do this kind of shooting. I want you to hold your rifles steady. Yqu do that and T'll surely put the bullets in the right place. ' But I’ll take you one at a time, I guess. Which of you is the most steady?”
This was hard to tell.
But Wild quickly selected Tom as the* one to start with.
“Take- aim at my head !” he said, sternly. “If you don’t I will cut a furrow in the top of your head and fetch the blood!”
Up went the rifle to the shoulder of the villain.
“Just imagine that you are going to shoot me and save your life by it,” went on the dashing young deadshot, coolly. “Steady now!’’
So experienced was he in the use of firearms that the boy knew he could not miss at that distance.
He ran his eye along the barrel of his rifle and got the sight in a line with the muzzle of the villain's rifle.
Crang!
As the sharp report rang out a cry of fear, which he was unable to suppress, camo from the lip* of the ruffian.
“That was all right,” said Wild, coolly. “Now you try it.”
The remark was addressed to the other man.
He took a little courage from what ho had seen <i<>: o. and obeyed quite readily.
Y017NG WILD WEST AND T1IE MINE GIRL.
Once more Wild took aim, and when he was ready lie pressed the trigger.
Crang ’
The second man to be put through the oTdeal hardly moved.
■'Now, then, you two galoots go on back to Con Decker and toil him that he had better appoint some one else to kill me. Tell him that you are not going to have any thing more to do with it, do you hear? If you do start out with such x thing in your heads again I am going to shoot out your teeth ! You know what that means, for I will be directly in front of you when I do it, and the bullets wil go cn through and come out at the hack of your heads You tell your leader just what I have told you!”
Wild did not want to make them prisoners, and he was not the sort to shoot them down, even if he did know for sure that they had set out with the intention of taking the lives of Cheyenne Charlie and himself. _
He felt that by sending them baek with the message he had told them that he would have the whole band of villains in fear of him, and as long as he could keep them that way he would soon -find a way to down them.
Wild told them to tal$e their weapons from the Chinaman and go on.
They seemed much relieved as they obeyed.
“You're ther. greatest shot .what ever pulled a trigger!”
Tom declared, unable to keep from expressing his opinion. “I’ll never furgit what yer jest done as long as I live!”
“Well, don’t think there is anything so wonderful about it, for any one who could hit- the centre of a bull’s-eye could do that, providing, of course, that the rifle he was shooting into was held perfectly still. You fellows held your rifles exactly still at the time I fired, so you are as much responsible for the good shooting as I am. Now light out, and give my compliments to the rest of the members of the Secret Band of Silver Shaft.”
We will follow the two men, leaving Wild to go on to meet Cheyenne Charlie, and Hop to go back tb the camp without continuing his way to the saloon he had set out for.
The villains did not speak to each other until they were half way to Red Ink Saloon, where they knew they would find Con Decker and the majority of the band.
"Do yer know one thing?” said Tom, who had been doing lots of thinking in the last minute or two. “I don’t believe Young Wild West shot any bullets at us. There ain’t no one livin’ as could do that.”
“Well, I believe it. I felt ther jar on my shoulder when ther bullet hit ther breech of my rifle,” was the reply.
Then he broke his gun and the mashed bullet was disclosed.
Tom did the same with his and found the same condi tion.
“HI give ini” he exclaimed. “Well leave them buU lets right there, an’ when -we show ’em ter Con we’ll tell him all about it, an* everything that Young Wild West said, too.”
“Not everything,” said the other, as he shook his haul. li J)o yer know one thing? Young Wild We?t hoard what. we was talkin’ about when w> stood there. Didirt he say 1 fur us ter give his compliments to ther rest of ther mem-
bers of ther Secret Band of Silver Shaft? How* did hi know about ther band if he didn't hear us talkin' about it? We mustn't tell that part of it, fur if we do we'll git in trouble with ther leader an' ther rest.”
“All right,” said Tom, shrugging his shoulders. “It's ioo bad that we. said anything about it. I’ll never do that again.”
Nor me, either. But it’s too late now. Young Wild West knows it, an’ he’ll be workin’ ag’in us now, see if he don’t!”
"Well, that makes it all the more necessary fur us ter git him out of ther way.”
“Yes, but who’s goin’ ter do that job? I ain’t, I know.” “Nor me, either; unless I git a mighty good chance, all unexpected/’
They hurried on to the saloon and found Con Decker there, as well as the majority of the band.
Decker knew right away that something had happened when he saw them come in, for there was something iu their looks that told him.
They each got a drink o£ something stimulating, and then Tom called the leader aside and whispered something to him which made him look surprised and go out.
Tom followed him and told him nearly everything had taken place, showing the mashed bullet in the breech of his rifle.
Decker was thunderstruck.
Then the other villain came out and showed the e\i-1 donee he had of one of the remarkable shots Young " dd West had fired. •
“lie sent his compliments to ther rest of ther gang, said the latter.
“He did, eh? We’ll he’ll wish he never seen us afore he gits through with us I”
“I reckon he’s goin’ ter he a mighty hard one ter down, though, Con.”
“That may be, but it must he done, just ther same. It must be done before another sunrise, too, hoys 1”
The two looked at each other and shrugged tlieit shoulders at this.
There was no doubt but that they did not want to be the ones to try it.
CHAPTER IX.
SOME GOOD HUNTING, A.ND 1IIHINO THAT PAID*
Cheyenne Charlie met Wild before he was half the blasted pine tree, where he told the scout to for him.	. ^
“What was ther shootin’ ahout, Wild?” Charlie aS ’ looking surprised.	c
“Oh, I was just showing the two galoots,	^
following us, something new in the line of shooting* the reply.
“I* that so? Yer stopped ’em, then?”	. ^he
“Well, they stopped right where I was hiding bushes, and i overheard a very interesting converse x Then our hero soon told him what had hap]?®116 'the scout shook his head.
YOUNG WILD WEST AXD THE MINE GIRL.	15
1 "Them two galoots should never have got away alive, Wild,” he declared. "I don’t believe in givin’ your enemies rope ter hang yer with. They’ll clown yer ther first chance they git, no matter if yer did give ’em a putty bad scare. That is, if they git ther chance. It ain’t likely that they’ll git us; but they'll try it, jest ther same.”
“Well, let them try it, Charlie. We know what we are up against now. W'e have got a secret band working for the purpose of killing us. This band committed several robberies last night, too; and it means to get possession of Sallie Bacon’s mine. The villains have got a whole
I	w
lot of work laid out? it seems.”
“Ther Secret Band of Silver Shaft, liey?” and the scout chuckled. “I xcckon it ain't so much of a secret now, is it?”
“Not now, Charlie. But by the way the t|vo villains talked it hasn't been organized but a short time. ‘We’ll undertake the task of breaking it up, and you can bet we will come pretty near doing it, too!”
“That’s sartin, Wild. What are yer goin’ ter do now, keep on with ther little hunt we started on?”
“Yes, for I reckon the two galoots won’t come back right away. Tf they tell their leader what I told them to they will all feel like laying low for a while, I think. Come on! I sent Hop back to the camp, but the chances ai'e that he will go on down to the mining camp aftei' his tanglefoot. If he gets into trouble there with any of the bad gang, ho will have to, that's all! We haven’t got *° be following him up all the time to save him from beinc or hurt.”
"Oh, lie’ll take care of himself all right when he’s around where there’s plenty of people. Here it was different, fur ther two galoots had him foul. They wouldn’t try anything like that in a saloon, yer know.”
Wild nodded, and then they set out to look for some game.
They covered over half a mile before they came upon Anything, and then Charlie spied the tracks of a bear.
It was only a half-grown one, too, as lie could readily tell by the tracks, and that meant that there was some very ^e meat waiting for him.
The scout took the hear trail and Wild went on up through a thicket.
1'he boy had not gone very far when a fat doe, with two fawns, started through the woods.
Young Wild West never shot a doe.
He did not hunt for the sake of killing alone, and to slay a female animal, even for eating purposes, was not his way.
But the boy’s quick eye told him that one of the fawns Was a buck.
That was the one lie wanted.
His rifle flew to his shoulder, and, waiting a second or two, so as to get a clear shot, lie took aim and pressed the trigger.
Orang!
As the report rang out the buck fawn fell.
"I reckon that’s enough for to-day.” muttered the 3'oung deadshot, as he threw out the empty shell.
He had hard!}' started for the fallen game when he heard a report from the direct ion Cheyenne Charlie had taken.
He gave a nod of satisfaction and pushed on through the undergrowth.
Reaching the fawn, he quickly bled it, and then the entrails were taken from it with a cleverness that few were capable of.
It was all done in a very few minutes, and then the boy started to join his partner, cariying his game over his shoulder.
He soon came upon the scout, who was just putting the finishing touches to a young, black bear.
Wild lay down his game and waited for him.
“This is putty good, Wild,” the scout remarked, with a chuckle. “We didn’t have ter conie very fur ter git stocked up with fresh meat, did we?”
“No, Charlie. But the woods are full of game here. 1 think I’ll try this afternoon for a mess of partridges.”
“'I was thinkin’ of trvin’ my luck at fisliina That stream what runs through ther Mine Gal’s claim is putty wide an’ deep half a mile further up, an’ she was tellin’ ther gals that her father used ter catch some fine fish there.”
“Go ahead and try it, providing the Secret Band allows us to. They might make an attempt to wipe us out before that time, you know. Suppose they make up their minds to do something desperate?”
The scout nodded at his rifle, which was lying on the ground within his reach.
“There’s fifteen shots in that Winchester, Wild,” he said, significantly. “When I git ter work at ’em it won’t be no fancy shoot in’ I’ll do, jest ter show ’em what I could do if I v,-anted ter. 1*11 give out ther real thing, an’ every time my rifle speaks .there’ll he one less of ther Secret Band of Silver Shaft.”
Wild nodded, and when Charlie had cut off the haunches of the bear and picked up the skin, he started 'off for the camp.
They reached it without seeing anything of their enemies, and Jim and the girls were delighted to see the fresh meat they brought in.
“You did well in such a short time,” Arietta observed, with a smile. “But I am sure I heard four shots fired.’’ “You did, Et,” the young deadshot replied. “But two of them didn’t count. Where is Hop?”
“Oh, he slipped away soon after you went. He has gone down to the mining camp, I reckon. Yon know what lie is. He has a mania for gambling, and he likes his tanglefoot altogether too much.”
“Well. T told him to come back to the camp.”
“Why. did you see him?” asked the scout's wife, looking surprised.
“Yes. He was right by me when I shot twice—the first two shots you heard fired.”
Wilil did not keep them in suspense, but related what had happened.
“So we have got a secret band against us now, eh?” Arietta said, looking thoughtful. “Well, now we may expect to have a lively time of it. There is no telling how many there are belonging to it, and it is quite likely that they have sworn to kill you, Wild, as well as steal this claim from Sallie.'5
"Well, 1 just told you that th'.’y had deeidtd io wipe me out,’’ was the smiling reply. “The two galuors were
going to do it a little while ago, and they might have wiped out both* Charlie and myself, if we had let them. But we are not letting such sneaking coyotes as they are get the best of us, are we, Charlie?”
"We ain't been in ther habit of doin’ it,” answered the scout, chuckling.
“Well, I reckon we won’t do a great deal worrying over it, anyhow,” our hero observed. “How have you made out, Jim?”
“Fine I” was the reply. “All there is to do is to haul the dirt up and wash it. It seems to be turning out about a thousand dollars to the ton, if I am any judge. That spot where Sallie’s father made the blast is full of gold, and it lies around in chunks. I don't know how far the lode runs, but what I have seen makes me think that there is a fortune here.”
Sallie s eyes became dimmed with tears as she heard the boy say this.
“Poor dad!” she exclaimed;, sorrowfully. “If he could only have lived to see this! He kept saying right along that he knew there was plenty of gold h£re. When he found the first lot that amounted to anything, which was only about a month before he died, he declared that he wasn't going to stop until he struck the mother vein. When he exploded that can of nitro-glycerine he found it, all right. But ho was feeling badly just then, and he came up and laid down, only io die! It is too bad !”
“It is too bad. that's right,” Jim answered. “But your father was getting along in years, and as he had an incurable disease, you should not let it worry you. Just think if lie had been a sound, healthy man, and he had been shot by the villains, who tried to get the mine away from you. Thai would have been much worse.”
“That is true; but it makes me feel badly when I think of what might have been.”
“Never mind tliinkiir* of what might have been; jest think of what might be,” spoke up the scout.
Dick Bryan came up from the shaft with a big lump just then and that changed the subject.
Wild looked at it and pronounced it to be almost virgin. “I reckon you did mighty well in coining to Silver Shaft, Dic-K,” he said, with a smile. “That lump weighs about twenty-five pounds, and it is worth enough to give a young man a start in life.”
“I never expected to fall into such luck as this,” Bryan replied.
“Weil, nevev mind,” said Sallic. “The more luck you have the better it will be for me. And the quicker the wine U worked out the sooner I will go to ’Frisco.” “That's ther way ter look at it!” exclaimed jC’harlie. “Now, Wild, are we goiir down ter look fur Hop?” “Yon,” was ilio answer from our hero. “I reckon he needs a little looking afl'u1. The chances are that we will find him in some gambling game, for he has been gone about* Ion*? enough to make himself acquainted.”
CHAPTER X.
HOP INTRODUCES A VERV r.VTEHESTfNO fl/YiE. Whe.i Wild (old Hop to :?o back to the camp the Chi-namnn started right off to obey.
But when be got close to it he sneaked along in the
bushes and took care that no one there saw liim approaching.
It so happened that the girls were all at the mouth of the shaft just then, while Wing sat dozing under a tree near by.
Hop stepped up and walked "behind his brother, and then quietly left again and took to the bushes.
“Misler Wild say me comee back to um camp, so be/' he muttered, a grin overspreading his yellow countenance. “Me do allee saniee whattee Misler Wild say, so be. But he no say me stay here, so me go down to um Led Ink Saloon and havee lillee fun, so be. Me velly muchee smartee Chinee.'-There is no doubt but that he felt that he was not breaking any command, and he hummed a cheerful ditty as he walked along.
He was not afraid of being held up this time, for he had seen enough of how villains acted after being taught a lesson from Young Wild West.
All he would have to do would be to mention the dashing young deadshot’s name if he got into trouble.
But if he was given half a show he would work out of it, anyhow, for he was too clever to get the worst of a bargain.	•
No one interfered with him, and in a very few minutes he was walking up the single street that was lined on either side of the shanties that made up the mining camp* The storekeeper sat on his little porch that was almost even with the ground, smoking away at his pipe.
Jle had no customers to wait upon just then, so he taking life easy.
He spoke pleasantly to Hop, for he thought he 'vas the one who had been in the store with our friends when they stocked up with some provisions.
“Velly nicee day,” said Hop, as he paused before the man and nodded, pleasantly.
“That’s right,” was the reply. “Was ther slulf yer got here last night all right?”
“Velly nicee glub; velly nicee Melican man keepee um store, so be,” was the cheerful reply.
“Blamed if you ain’t a putty nice sort of a Chinee, the storekeeper declared. “I reckon Tit take yer across to ther lied Ink an’ treat yer.”
“Me likee nicee Melican man velly muchee,” Hop went on to say, acting as though he was very much in earnest. “Me takee lillee tanglefoot with um, if um please, so be.”
The storekeeper took a look around, and seeing no customers in sight, arose from the stool he had been sitting on and started over to the saloon.
Hop went along with him, keeping up bis words praise, and getting more in his favor all the.tinv\
He even told the man that he was very handsome, *‘u11 wondering why it was that a whole stageload of good' looking, marriageable women had not journeyed to Silv<?x Shaft, just for the purpose of trying to rope him into state of double blessedness.
The fact was that the storekeeper possessed a nose was decidedly crooked and had a wall eye. He was a11?'" thing but handsome, but he seemed to take what Chinaman had said seriously.	*
Probably it was the first time he had ever been
^1--
that lie was a. handsome man, and it made him feel so '"'good that he hail no time to think whether it was a compliment or a joke.
But Hop certainly did not look as though he was joking.
He looked to be sublimely innocent and very much in earnest.
“Give this Chinee some of your very best firewater, Ted,” the storekeeper said, as lie led the way into the saloou. “He's about tlier whitest heathen I ever seen.”
“I reckon lie’s about ther smartest one I ever seen,” the boss of the place replied, as he put out the bottle and a couple of glasses.
Hop smiled blandly as he took a look around.
As he expected, the two villains who had held him up were there.
So was their leader and the rest of the band.
They had just started playing cards at two tables, but they were all attention when the clever Chinaman came in.
“ Voily nicee day,” remarked Hop, bowing to them, just as though he had never experienced the least bit of trouble with any of them.
“Aw, shot up!” retorted Con Decker, who no doubt felt as though he would like to shoot him right then and there.	1
“Me allcc samee workcp for Young Wild West,” went °n Jlop, smiling a little heavier. “Me allee samee velly Hiueheo smaricc Chinee.”
✓^.“You bet you’re a mighty smart Chinee!” spoke up the good-natured miner called Bill, who had lost hip live dollars in the bet with Hop.
He came in the back door of the saloon in time to overbear his remark, and his face wore a broad grin a9 he naw him.
“See here, Ted,” spoke up the storekeeper, after he had taken a look at his store across the street, and found that there ‘was no one approaching it. "How is it that yor all say that ther Chinee is sich a smart feller? He didn't show that he was so awful smart when he was with Young Wild West in ther store. He acted jest like a very civil heathen, an' 1 must say that he's about ther politest °ne I ever seen.”
“He wasn’t in your store,” corrected Ted Blight. "It was ther other one. This one come in here while they was over in ther store. Yer ought ter seen how' easy he won five dollars from Bill. It was jest like pickin’ up ther money in ther street.” .
“Me likee urn storekeeper velly muehee; he velly hand-some man,” spoke up Hop, as though he was trying to change the subject.
There was a laugh at this.
No one there thought the man was handsome, and hence tlie laugh.
Bill knew that Hop was simply poking fun at the storekeeper. and he laughed so hearty that the latter got very finery.
“What are yer laughin’ at?” he demanded, savagely.
" 'Cause he said you was a handsome man,” was the ,,(‘ply, and then Pill aeted as though he was goins to have « fit.
“Maybe he kin see belter than you” wag the retort.
“Maybe he kin. But never mind; it's all right. It's ther best thing I’ve heard in a week/*’
“Me likee playee lillee game, so be,” said Hop, suddenly.
He drew a little top from his pockets, which, had four squared sides to it, and on each of them was a letter.
The letters were P, T, N and A.
It was nothing more than a cheap gambling device, and such tops are sometimes used now*.
P meant that the person spinning it must put up whatever the amount of the stake was in the game, should that letter be upward when the top came to a standstill.
T meant that the spinner should take the amount of the stake out: N meant that nothing was to be taken, and A was for all there was in the pot.
Any number could play the game, and when Hop began spinning the top, which, by tbe way, was one of bis own manufacture, those in the room not playing cards got very much interested.
One or two declared that they had played the game when they were boys, using pins and marbles for stakes.
“It’s a square game, I reckon,” said one. “Let's try it.”
Nine miners out of ten will gamble, it seems, for they lave to do something to keep up excitement.
Hop smiled and then set' the top going.
Strange, as it may seem, the letter P came up.
“Me puttee up, so be,” he said, blandly; and then he laid a dollar on the counter.
The good-natured man called Bill was next to try it. N came up this time, so he passed' it along to the storekeeper.
He gave the top a spin and P came up again.
“That’s putty good,” he said, as he placed a dollar on the counter. “This are what 1 calls a bully old game."
Four miners tried it then, and three out of the four got P’s, whHe the other got an N.
Then it came Hop’s turn again.
He pressed a little spring that no one saw and then set the top spinning.
This time it came to a stop with the A upward.
“Me takee allee!” he said, smilingly.
“That's right,” answered Bill. “That’s a square game, all right. Start her up ag'in. You're ther winner.’’
Hop did 6tart it up again, but not until he had pressed the spring that would slip a .piece of lead to the A skh;, so it would be'next to impossible for it to come up.
He got a 1\ just as he wanted to get. and this tim/> lie put up five dollar?.
“That's it!” exclaimed the saloonkeeper. “1 rock.;. I’ll come in on this, too!"
For the next half hour the top was kept g-.ang e<;ntii>-tially, and Hop managed to win every lime.
Once in a while one of them got his stakes back, Irnt w one but the Chinaman ever got an A up.
Then they grew suspicious of the t*p. bv.i the spring was so cleverly concealed that they failed to find anything wrong about it, ant\ were t’oreed io admit i .t;; the Chinaman must know how to spin it.
The game started up again, and then Oon Dcrkei- quc: pluving cards and came in.
Why don't yer put up somethin’ worth while, Heathen r” he said. “Chuck up fifty or a hundred.” “Allee light,,J answered Hop, as the same old P came up; and then he laid down a hundred-dollar bill.
CHAPTEPt XI.
CHARLIE IS CAUGIIT NAPPING.
“I reckon I'm out!” exclaimed the storekeeper, who was a pretty close man, and did not care to risk so much money on a game of chance.
“Well, no one?s boldin’ yer; git out if yer want tei;!” retorted Con Decker, with gruff sarcasm.
Then some more dropped out, and only Bill and Ted remained in the game with Hop and the leader of the Secret Band of Silver Shaft.
It was Decker's turn next, and when he turned up the P on the top he nodded and put up a hundred dollars.
“I'll take my chances on giftin' that back, an’ more with it,” he said.
Bill got an N, so that left him in the game without having to put up anything.
Ted turned up a T by good luck, and he took a hundred dollars from the counter and smiled in a cheerful way.
Hop allowed himself to get a P again, and he put up another hundred.
Then Decker got the same thing.
“Ther blamed P seems ter come up oftener than anything else,” he remarked, as he pulled out a hundred and placed it up.
He was right, for Bill got it this time, too, and he grinned, declaring that his chances were as good as any of the rest.
Ted then gave the top an extra hard spin, and up came the P.
“Well, by jingo!” he exclaimed. “I believe ther top is made so ther P comes up ther most.”
“If you spin um light um A comee up, so be,” said Hop, and then he picked up the top, pressed the spring, and let it go.
Up came A, as nicely as anything, and, with a smile that was “childlike and bland,” he scooped in the pile.
It was at tlni.6 juncture that Young Wild West and Cheyenne Charlie came in.
The members of the Secret Band showed signs of uneasiness rijrht away.
Three of them got up and went out by the back way right away.
Charlie looked at Wild and then went out by the front way.
He had an idea that the three who had gone out might hfi up to something, knowing chat our hero could take of himself :n the pla*-*;, he wanted to find out what :t was.
Lie found out before he thought he tfould.
He had -rtfreelj' > urn* • live ' truer of the house when a blanket was -Jiw.wn ovftr hN htrr1.
As he made- a mow to thvow it oft he was leaped upon
by the same two men that hp.d followed he and Wild, and who had been given a good scare by our hero.
The villains had not thought about making a capture until he sneaked out of the back way.
A big blanket was hanging over a. line there, and when they noticed by looking through a window that Cheyenne Charlie immediately started to go out by the front door, it suggested something to them.
“If 1 chuck that blanket over his head will you two nail him, bo he can't lettout a yell?” the third man asked, as he took the blanket.
“Yes, if he comes around this way,” Tom Pike answered.
The others nodded ascent to the plan.
It worked like a charm.
Charlie had been caught unexpectedly, for he never lad the least idea that the villains would try anything like i hat in broad daylight, and right in the heart of the mining camp, too.
The three scoundrels quickly had him bound and gagged, for the blanket placed the scout at such a disadvantage that he could not put up near as good a fight as he might have done had his way been clear.
‘‘Off with him, now!” exclaimed Number Seven of the band, who had been the one to suggest the trick. “Where to?” they whispered.
“To Con’s shanty, if nowhere else. We’ve got ter take lim somewheres, ain't we?”
"Or else use a knife on him an’ leave him right here,” suggested one.	- -■*>
“That wouldn’t do, an’ yer know it. Wouldn’t Young Wild West know right away that we done it? An’ wouldn't he have ther whole camp after us in no time? No. We've got ter take this galoot somewheres an’ hide him. Then we kin git away with him in some secret way, so he’ll never be seen or heard of ag’in. That’s it!”
They were dragging their prisoner along as they talked, and they were soon back of the shed that was in the rear of the shanty saloon.
Once there they were out of sight of every one, for it was on the opposite side where the majority of the claims of the miners were located.
As has been stated, Con Decker’s shanty was not far from the saloon.	,
The three scoundrels soon reached it, but they 'vere.®j^ sure that they had not been seen by any one, for it be that they had come under the eye of somebody at time they made the attack on their prisoner.
But they were going to take their chances, anyhow. Once inside the shanty, they quickly made Charlie doubly secure, and then they quickly left it and returned to the saloon, going in by the back way, just as though nothing had happened.
The game with the top was in progress again, though the stakes were not so large.
Young Wild West stood near the door, watching i*>, and at the same time keeping an eye on the villains in the room.
When he saw the three who had left in such a hut’1')' come buck he wondered what Charlie had been up 'to.
1 le expected to see him come in the' front way at minute.
Hop spun the top fust then, and up came the P.
“Me puttee up ten dollee,'' he said, blandly.
“All right,” nodded the miner called Bill, nodding approvingly.
Then he made the top go and got an N.
Con Decker followed with a P.
The saloon keeper got the same, and then Hop scooped in the money again by turning up the A.
“How long have you been playing that game, Hop?” asked Wild.
“A3 lee samee half an hour, so be,” was the reply.
“Well, I reckon you’d better quit it and give the men their money back.”
The Chinaman’s face fell.
^f“Me play urn velly square garaee, Misler Wild,” he protested.
“Oh, 3res; it is a square game, I suppose! You have ’von every time, haven't you?”
“Me no know.”
“Ther heathen has been ther only one ter git ther A ulV spoke up Ted, the boss of the saloon.
“Well, isn’t that enough to make you fellows think there is something wrong about the top? You ought to have found that out long ago.”
‘It ain’t ther top what anything’s wrong with,” said LjJl j t}ier Chinee what knows how ter spin it right.” Wild knew all about the top.
It was the first time he had seen it in a long time, how-ever.
^tided that Hop must give back tho money he " oecuusc it was a swindling game.
‘Shell out!” he said to him. “You can play a game that is more square than that, and stand a show of win-ning. Just give them back what they have lost.”
Then he took the top and pressed the spring, after w hich he gave it a spin.
The P came up.
He pressed the spring back, and then the A came up.
Now,” said he, "any of you can get the A; try it.” They did so, even to Con Decker, who seemed to be Ver.V much interested in what*Wild said.
cPve lost quite a little money on that top,” he said, ^hen he had learned how the spring worked. “I'll take ther top an’ call it square.”
“Alice light,” answered Hop.
^ Wild did not care, so long as everybody else was satis-Jl-d, for he knew that Deckcr would not stand much of a 8how to win money from the miners in Silver Shaft,
It would be spread all over by night.
Still, there are some men who will put their money Against any kind of a game, no matter how crooked it ^‘as.
There might be some of that sort in the mining camp. The game broken up, and the money paid back to the l°sers, Wild decided to go out ami look for Churlie.
He did not tell Hop to go b^ck to the camp, for he bought he would give him a chance to enjoy himself till got tired.
When the boy got outside he saw nothing of the scout, he gave a low whistle.
There was no answer f.o it.
Then he walked around Tho house,	:
He had barely reached the corner when a man undertook to throw a blanket over his head.
It was the same game that had been worked upon the scout, but it did not work with Wild.
He was on the alert for danger when he started around the house, and he sprang back just far enough to escape the blanket.
He threw it aside with his arm and leveled his revolver at the man who had thrown it.
Those who had been there to assist him made a bolt the instant that he had made a miss of it.
“Come back here, you sneaking coyote!” Wild called out.
The man gave a leap and got around the corner of the building, and just then our hero fired, hitting one of his boot heels.
Then the boy ran around to the front of the building and called out:
*Tll give you galoots just five minutes to produce my partner! Get a move on you. or lead is going to fly!”
CHAPTER XII.
THE SECRET BAND IS TUT TO FLIGHT.
Wild knew right away when the attempt to throw the blanket over his head was made that the Secret Band was responsible for the disappearance of Cheyenne Charlie.
It was easy for him to guess that they had caught the scout napping and had either killed or made a prisoner of him.
Now the young deadshot was going to find out all about
it.
Single-handed, though he was, he meant to give the villains such a grilling that they would never forget it.
There was no reply to his threatening call, so he walked inside the building.
The whole gang was gathered there, along with the good element of the camp.
Wild did not know which of them it was who had tried io get the blanket over his head, but that made no difference. He was going to take them as a whole now.
“Did you hear what I said from the outside?” he asked as he looked at the ruffians. “If Cheyonne->Charlie is not produced here within five minutes 1 am going to start in and clean you fellows up! T'll make quick work of the Secret Band of Silver Shaft, and don’t you forget it!”
The boy had a revolver in either hand, and when the words came from his lips the villains looked at each other uneasily.
All but two of them were surprised to hear him mention the Secret Baud, too.
“Why, what do I know about your pard, Young Wild West?” asked Con Pecker, hi? face very pale.
“It makes no difference what von know about him. You have got just four minutes left, to product' him. Just ns sure as yon are in this room. T am going to pump load into you if he is not here on lime! One of your gang can go and fetch him here, or you will all ruu. the risk of
dying! I’ll guarantee that if I get my shooters working once you fellows will drop right and left!”
Tom Pike got up and started for the door.
“You haven’t got much time,” Wild said.
The honest miners in the room took their places near our hero, though they did not quite understand what it all meant.
“What's ther matter, anyhow?” Bill asked. .
"Well, some of these galoots trapped my partner when he went outside, and they have taken him somewhere, or else killed him,” was the reply. “They tried the same thing on me when I went out to look for him, but it wouldn’t work. They didn't get any blanket over my head. You heard the shot I fired? Well, that was at the scoundrel who was going to throw a blanket over my head, so he would have me foul when his friends got me. I hit the heel of his boot, so you can pick him out, I reckon.”
One of the scoundrels moved uneasily.
"That must be ther galoot,” said ’Bill, drawing a shooter. ‘‘Come on out an’ let’s see your heels.”
"It's me what got hit on the boot heels,” spoke up the fellow Wild had made an example the day before, as he stepped out.
"We ain’t alludin* ter you jest now,” was the retort. “Come! Step out!”
The good-natured miner seemed to be bolder than he had ever shown himself before, and probably it was because he had Young Wild West there to back him.
He looked straight at the man, who had shown signs of being uneasy when Wild spoke about hitting the heel of the man who had tried to throw a blanket over his head. The villain stepped out.
“Hold up your hoofs!” ordered the miner.
Wild was keeping the rest covered, and not one of them dared to roach for his shooter.
It must have been galling to the guilty man, but he held up his boots, as directed.
One of the heels had the plain mark of a bullet. “You're ther one!” exclaimed Bill, nodding with satisfaction. “1 reckon it’s about time a stop was put ter this kind of business. I wonder if you was ther galoot what cleaned out my shanty last night? I ain’t said nothin’ about it afore, ’cause I was try in’ ter git a clue as ter who done it. I heard that there was some others robbed, too, and that ther losers is on a still hunt after ’em.”
"lie belong* to the gang that did it,” spoke up Wild, coolly. "They have organized’ themselves into what they call the Secret Band of Silver Shaft, and their avowed purposes are to steal all they can, get possession of Sal-lir- Bern's mine and put me out of the way, well as my partners and friends!”
I f a bom!) had exploded in their midst the villains could not have boon more astounded.
They were utterly dismayed—crushed, as it were.
Wild looked at the clock that hung back of the counter in the saloon.	j
"That galoot has just got one more minute to fetch Clii-yeim'- Oharlie here,” he said, glancing meaningly at C’oii .Docker.
The vi.nl- wi.to .scarcely out of bis mouth when two : iioiiis conuded outside, and then:
"Whoopee! Whoopee!”
It was the familiar call of Cheyenne Charlie. •
“Whoopee! Whoopee!” answered Wild.
The next moment the scout sprang in through the back doorway, a six-shooter in either hand.
"Here I am, Wild!” he cried, exultantly. "Ther £;l* loots catched me nappin', but one of ’em come an’ let jn<; go, which was surprisin’ ter me. I got my weapons. then I looked an’ seen him mountin’ a horse ter light o«b I told him ter come back, an’ he wouldn’t. Then h1’ takes a shot at me, an’ I takes a shot at: him. He niis?ei —but I didn't!”
The villains must have been unanimous in think,n? that it was time for them to make a break, for they A started at the same time.
Two of them went through the windows, and the bolted for the doors.
Wild tried to stop them, but as he did not fire.- t^*} kept right on.	j
Charlie would have blazed away at them if it had uo , been for the boy.	.
He could not shoot them while they were running away.	*	•
“Let them go, Charlie,” he said. “We’ll catch them* redhanded yet. The men here don’t know* just what sor^ of a gang they are yet. We will let them find out 1T)0*^ about them, and then we’ll light on them good and h1,r“‘ They all ran out of the place, and some of the luinci? were ready to shoot at the villains.	,
One of them did fire at a man as he dodged ajwinj., behind a shanty, but he missed.	tff ,
“Take it easy, boys!” said Young Wild West. * es>^ wait till you hear all about this thing. Then you can t ^ cide upon what you are going to do with the scoundro ?• He got their attention right away, and then
he quu'K-
ly told them all he knew about Con Decker and his ©an^j He, of course, told them of the conversation he ha< heard from the two who had set out after him and Cha* lie that morning, and wound up by letting them kno*, how he had shot bullets into the muzzles of their rii hoping to frighten them so that they would give up 10 idea of trying to kill him.
The men listened in silence.	.
Young Wild West was just the kind of a leader wanted.
“Thor Secret Band of Silver Shaft has got ter wiped out!” declared Ted Blight, the saloon keeper. “'They’ve all been mighty good customers of mine, hu that don’t make any difference. Ilangin’ is what the} want! I don’t want no man ter spend money here wh;l1 he’s stole from some one else. I’m ag’in that kind ol ,l business. If a galoot loses his money here gambliiv that ** his own fault. T don’t tell no one that he’s got ter faro or roulette; an’ I don’t have ter, fur that nudt('r' Ther most of ’em is morc’n willin’ ter take ther chai^*’ at it when they think they’ve got more money than want. We ain’t goin’ ter have no sneak thieves hero ^ Silver Shaft, not by a jugful! We'cl better elect Wild West, our leader, an’ then start in ter clean ’em Yer all know putty well that every man of them ten loots ain’t no good, when yer ^omo right down tor pan, an’ sift ’em over. They’re all of ther kind ^
I would kill a man without givin' him a show; an’ when it I comes ter sneakin' around when folks is asleep an-* stealin’ / what they’ve got saved up, why, then it's time ter start I things a-goin’!”
I It was quite a lit tie (speech the saloon keeper made, and I it was evident that he had surprised himself even. I I The men broke into a cheer, for he spoke their senti-1 I incuts, alt right
I “Young Wild West has got ter be our leader!” cried!
I Bill, tossing his hat in the air. "He’s ther one ter lead I us in this game.”
I "Hold on, gentlemen,” said Wild, raising his hand. "I think you had better make some one else your leader. Wait till you get the men together to-night. As for myself, I S^eckon I had better go it alone in the game, with my partners to back me. I have told the Mine Girl that I won’t allow the Secret Band to get possession of her urine, and I mean to keep my word. That makes one fight I have got on hand. Then the villains have sworn to kill us, so that makes another. We will fight them our uay, and you can go at them your own way. But you can bet that they will soon be clcaned out!”
Another cheer went up, and then Wild and Charlie h‘tt them and started for the camp on the Mine Girl’s claim. ‘	•	1
CHAPTER XIII.
'J'lSK CAVE AT THE END OF THE HIDDEN GULLY.
xii spite of all the boasting and planning they had done, the Secret Band of Silver Shaft was in"a badly demoralized condition when its members fled from the lied Ink Saloon, running for their lives, as it were.
Tlio shot fired at them by one of the miners served to I Peare them all the more, and not one of them offered I to answer it.
But it Mas not their purpose to put up a fight agains ibe miners of Silver Shaft
> They wanted to make them believe that they were al] ri«?lit, if they could, and if they were pressed pretty hard thay would denounce Young Wild West as a meddlesome ,flr> and ask for the proofs of their being dishonest.
.This was what was floating through the mind of Con ,vA‘cW, as ho ran for his shanty.
Jlo was clever enough to realize that Young Wild West * °r his partners must have heard some of the members i diking about the band, and hence their knowledge of it j decker thought out a whole lot in a few seconds. lie knew something that no other person knew of, and was that there was n hidden hole right back of the belonging to ilw Mine Girl.
He had figured it out two or three days before that it. mj. fafce much work io dig a short tunnel from I hole to the mine, and then it would be quite easy to ,c'l) tbo mine, in case they failed to get possession of it. .'Thu; j10iC) ov cave, as it mi*rhf properly be called, was at C: ‘Mid of a narrow gully that was covered almost com-jjy jspreading boughs and hanging vines.
• ^ b*>n "||,0 villain readied the shauty he did not know ilhi what to do.
I He heard the cheering of the small crowd gathered in I front of the Bed Ink Saloon, and that probably made I him decide.
I Few of his men possessed horses, so there was no chance I to get away from the mining camp.
Number Seven had been shot bv Cheyenne Charlie, so that left- only nine in the band now, and though they should have been able to put up a very stiff fight against the miners, if it came to it, they had not the courage to do it.
The men all crowded into the shanty as fast as they reached it, no doubt expecting that they would be at-lacked at any minute.
"Boys,” said the leader, trying to be very calm, “I recft-on we're in a putty tight place jest now.”
"We sartinlv are,” Number Two hastened to exclaim. "Young Wild West has found out in some way about our secret band.”
The two who knew they were responsible for it looked uneasy.
But though he was scanning the faces of them all, Con Decker could not pick any one out he thought might be traitors, or any way . careless about the secrets of the band.
The fact was that they all were too much agitated and i frightened to give him the chance to pick out the ones I responsible for it
I "It strikes me that we ain’t safe here in Silver Shaft,”
I went on Decker, shrugging his shoulders and glancing ap-! prehensively out of the window.
There was a silence, for no one seemed to know just what to say.
"A hiding place is ther thing we want jest now. We must make ’em all believe tlmt we've lit out,” went on the leader. “Now I happen ter know jest where a good hidin' place is, so we’d better make tracks fur it.”
They brightened up at this.
"If we lay low fur ther balance of ther day it are likely that they’ll think we’ve lit out fur good. Now, each man %it what he kin in ther line of grub, blankets, picks an*
I shovels, an' cartridges an’ meet me as soon as possible at the Bear’s Paw.”
The Bear’s Paw was a big, black rock of the shape of the paw of the animal it was named for, and was right near the mouth of the hidden gully, a mil” back 01 the Mine Girl’s claim, on the other side of the ridge.
They all knew where it was, so there was a nod of assent i till around.
I "Do yer think they’ll let us git awav. Con ?•” one ot ! them asked, as though he had his doubts about it.
I "Yes, I reckon they won't git after us jest yet We'll finake out that we’re mindin’ our own business. We won’t take no horses, cause there ain’t over thr<>o of yer what owns any. We’ll make out that we’re strikin’ out on 4'i/ot, an’ maybe they’ll be satisfied ter let us go.'1
They waited there for over half an hour, and thnn, seeing that there were no hostile demonstrations, they gradually left the shanty.
Each man had a duty to perform, and he *.;-t abou! to do if,
If they were going to remain in hiding any fang!h i f time they must have provisions 011 hand.
One by one they got what they could and then left the camp, following the trail that led away from it until they reached the woods.
It was evident that they were being watched, hut no one offered to bother them, so they kept at it.
It was just about noon when Con Decker found that all had gathered at the Bears Paw.
He was one of the last to arrive, and the different articles he brought had weighed him down pretty good.
"Here we are!” he exclaimed. “Now ter git in ther gully an’ hide our tracks. Foiler me, boys, an’ bring yer stuff with yer.”
Then the scoundrels began stepping from stone to stone uittil they got in under the houghs and vines.
Here the leader called a halt.
“Yer see that dead tree that seems about Teady ter fall?” he asked.
"Yes,” came the reply.
"Well, if that was ter fall down across ther end of ther gully this place would be hid, wouldn’t it?”
“Yes.”.
"An’ if it was hid from view no one would be apt ter think we was in here, would they?”
"No,” chorussed the villains.
"Well, down comes ther tree, then. Who’s a. good climber?”
"I am,” answered Number Three, and, knowing just what was required of him, he took a rope he had brought with him and began ascending a pine that was right alongside the dead tree.
When he got up a little distance he tied the rope to the tree and then slid down
"Git a hold,” he said, and two or three of them did so.	>-
They swung their weight on the rope and down came the tree with a crash.
"Thcire!” exclaimed Decker, jubilantly. "I reckon no one will ever think we passed this way. "Come on, boys! It might be that we’ll go out by another way when we leave.”
"What’s that, Con?” asked Number Two, as though he did not quite catch what he said.
“We might leave by another way when we git ready ter go, I said,” was the reply.
"Why, how's that?”
"Wait! I’ll show yer putty soon.”
They pushed on through the gully, which was so narrow and dark in places that they had to go slow.
In a few minutes its end was reached, and then the hole was before them.
"Looks like a bears’ den,” said one, as he cautiously peered in the opening.
“Yes, an5 it strikes me that we’ve been travel in’ right back* towards the camp, too,” spoke up another.
"That’s jest what we have been doin’,” Con answered, with a grin. “I don’t know whether t\\\< is a bears’ den or not. But it wasn’t a few days ago, when 1 was here. I struck this cave fayin' ter find out how close I could git ter Bacon's mine from the rear wav. There ain’t more’n twenty feet of soft, dirt between thor back of this cave an* thor inside of that mine. boys. What do yer think of that?”
Not one of the villains had dreamed of such a thing as this, and they looked at him with amazement depicted on their faces.
Decker 4miled and acted very proud of liis achievement.
"Do yer know one thing?” he went on, speaking in a low tone of voice. "If we can’t git hold of tliear Mine Gal’s gold any other way we kin sneak it out this way, an take a little at a time until we’ve got enough ter make it \vorth our while ter light out from Silver Shaft fur good! I ain’t been asleep ther last few days, boys. Things might be putty black jest now, but they’ll light up mighty sudden. See if they don’t!”
One of them ventured inside the hole.
There was a drop of four feet to a comparatively 1°^ flooring of splintered rock.
“Wait!” said Decker. "Here’s a lantern.”
He produced the lantern, lighted it and handed it him.
Then it^eould be seen that the cave extended back for nearly a hundred feet.
This are what I calls a fine hole ter hide in, boys,’ chuckled Decker, who was now getting back to his old way of feeling. "What do we care fur Young Wild ’West or any one else now?”
The villains actually felt like giving a cheer.
But they had been cautioned not to make much noise? so they refrained from it.
In less than five minutes they were all inside the <javc> which proved to be remarkably dry, considering that th® rays of the sun never reached it.
"Fix up your quarters, boys, an’ then we’ll seef aboiit diggin’ our way inter ther mine that’s adj’inin’ us,” said Decker, as he lighted his pipe and sat down on a rock.
CHAPTER XIV
IIOP SHOWS THE M1NEUS SOME ilORK OF IlIS CLEVERNESS*
Hop Wah was very much interested in all that took
i place.	„ _
But when he saw Wild and Charlie set out for the
amp, without saying anything to him, he felt much re- * ieved.
It was probably due to the Chinaman that the miners lid not etnrt in a body and make an attack on the shanty of Con Decker, for he proposed that they have a game dice at the bar.
As Hop had worked the top game so cleverly they were all anxious to learn what lie knew about dice.
Hop knew a whole lot about them.	,
He had two or three sots of them in his pockets, ofle 0 * them being trick dice.	^
The latter had only fives and sixes on thetn, so no ter how the three cubes rolled out, nothing less than teen would count.
This was a fraud that could easily be detected. ^ when a game was in progress, and the excitemen * high few would notice that anything was wrong them.
Hop produced three dice that were of the regular kind and began rolling them on the counter.
The miners quickly came inside and gathered about him.
, Good-natured Bill was eager to get in a game with him, £o he proposed that they throw for a dollar,
“Allee light,” said Hop, smiling blandly. “If me win me no givee uni money back, 'less Young Wild West itfinee.”
“Why, are yer go in’ ter cheat in this game, too?” and the miner grinned and winked at his companions.
[ “Me no cheatee,” declared Hop. “Me allee samee sj^deo Chinee.”
"Well, you’re welcome ter cheat this time, 'cause we'll, all be lookin’ fur it. Plow many is goin’ in this game?”
^ All of them wanted to go in, so Hop felt all the more satisfied.
The storekeeper had gone^over to his place of business, he could not take part.
Probably he was thinking of the flattering things the clever Chinaman had said to him, and wondering if they )vere really said in earnest.
^1-ach man put up a dollar, including Ted, the saloon
} High man takes ther money and low man is stuck fur
,ei drinks,” the latter said. “I ain't in business jest fur
lher f«n of it »
“Al!. .
y^vr-.vJrGJight,” answered Hop. “Me allee samee muchee
| ^aii.sly* go j)a„
I iliey were all satisfied, for the truth was that none of iei11 l'iad been drinking much that morning, probably on account of the excitement, that had prevailed.
Hop did not lead off, but handed the dice to the man Whest down the line.
first rolled out fourteen.
Inal was a very good throw.
I hat remained high until it eamc the turn of the man
next to Hop.
I hen he surprised them all by rolling out fifteen.
Hop calmly picked up the dice and slyly changed them the crooked dice he was holding concealed in the palm hand.
He knew he could not get any lower than fifteen, and “'<* eft&nces were good for him to beat it.
He did beat it, too, for lie rolled out seventeen.
“ Lat velly nicee thlow,” he observed, as he reached for mono}'.
He then picked up the dice and waited for the money be up again.
“lie's mighty lucky,” observed Bill. “But I reckon * l>pro was no cheatin’, about that.”
Hop led off, throwing eighteen this time.
/The gamblers gave a simultaneous gasp, and before bey had recovered from their astonishment Hop had i;*oelced the dice from the counter, accidentally, as it tfcjnecl.
He picked them up and put down the regular ones, i.he throwing continued and lie won again, of course.
^ I his continued for five or six times, and then Bill sud-’% grew suspicious, as Hop picked up the dice after l*U(1iug 0fj; with sixteen to his credit.
"Let ther dice lay!’’ he said, grabbing his hand. “I always want ter pick up my own dice.”
Hop was forced to let him have them.
The good-natured miner then threw* and rolled out eighteen.
The next man did the same.
It went on around and all had big throws, with three to tie.
Then Bill happened to see something queer about the dice.
He noticed that there was a six up on one of them and a six on the side, too.
He picked them up and examined them.
“Great snakes, boys!” he exclaimed. "We've been sold ag'in! Look at them dice!”
They all soon saw what they were.
“No wonder ther heathen won every time!” observed one.
"Me no undelstand,” said Hop, shaking his head and appearing very innocent.
"No, yer don’t understand, I s'pose,” remarked the saloon keeper. "Well, by jingo!”
Hop went in his pockets and pulled out the money he had won.
He thought he would surely have to give it up or else get into trouble.
But he was mistaken.
"Boys, it serves us good an’ right!” exclaimed Bill.. "Young Wild West said he couldn't play a square game, an’ we hadn't ought ter have played with him. Let him keep what lie's won, fur my part.”
"They all sided with Bill, and then Hop smiled serenely and put the money back in his pocket.
But Bill kept the dice, however.
"I reckon they belong ter me.” ho remarked, with a grin, “I’ll look fur some suckers some time, as Hop has been doin'.”
As Hop had more of the same kind, he did not mind losing the dice so much.
"Me likee play lillee game dlaw pokee now,” he said, smiling at the men.
“I reckon not!” answered Ted, shaking his head. "I've seen jest about enough of you ter make me think that you’re a regular hummer!”
"I ain't afraid ter play,” -spoke up Bill. "I've got aboiit fifty dollars yet, an’ T may as well lose it as not. Ther quicker I do lose it ther quicker I’ll go ter work.” There wore two others who wanted to play, too, so the* four soon sat down at a table.
"It’s cheat fur all yer know how, I s’pose,” said Kill as he looked over the cards Ted brought’them. "We know that we're up ag’in a crook, so that means beat him ii yer kin.”
"That’s it!” the other two exclaimed in unison.
Hop put on an injured look, but it did not fool them any.
"You’re a slick article, Hop,” Bill said, with a grin. “I'm somewhat of a card sharp myself, so yea* want ter look out.”
“Me allee samee lookee out tee allee timee, so be,” was the reply.
They cut for deal and Bill won.
The first thing he did was to begin to steal cards from the pack, and the others saw it.
Hop saw it, too, but he did not appear to.
Bill had appropriated the four aces of the pack, and Hop was perfect!}* aware of it.
But it was his next deal, and he made up his mind that he was going to get the four aces then.
The ante was not very heavy, and after a little betting Hop called it and Bill won the pot.
The Chinaman had hold of the cards the moment he laid them down.
Tben he shuffled them so briskly that the lookers on were amazed.
But he was really putting certain cards where he wanted them.'
Bill cut and then the deal was made.
Bill got three of the aces cold, and lie wondered how it was.
But Hop knew.
He gave himself four kings and then let the others have them as they happened to come out.
It so happened that they all stayed in this time.
The betting was not very brisk, however, for they were all afraid of the clever Chinaman.
Bill drew two cards and got a pair of queens to go along with his three aces.
This was a hand worth betting on, but lie knew that the chances were that there was one out against him that would beat it.
And so there was.
Hop’s four kings would do that.
But the way he acted threw the good-natured miner off his guard somewhat.
In drawing cards the Chinaman hesitated about taking three or only one.
That made it look as though he was holding a four-fiush, with a pair, and that he did not know whether to try and fill out the flush or draw to his pair.
Anyhow, he took one card, and as it was the other ace he knew he surely held the best hand out.
But the betting only put the pot up to about thirty dollars, and when Bill called him and found that the Chinaman held four kings, he was satisfied.
“I reckon that'll do,” he said. “It ain’t no use, boys. Ther C'hinee has got us beat all holler. Do yer know anything else. Hop?”
“Me velly muehee smartee Chinee,” was the mild retort. “Me gottee uncle in China whattee velly muehee > 11artee, and me allee samee likee my uncle.”
CHAPTER XV.
HOP AND CHARLIE TAKE A DROP.
Hop left the saloon soon after that and made his way up i , iho camp.
It. war noon when he got there, and Wing was pre->»;.irip. ;r tho dinner.
* Wv-11, • <*w did yer make out. Hop?” Cheyenne Charlie o k'-f him.
i: V;•! Iv mnfh(‘c- fineo, Mi«h*r Charlie,” was the reply.
Now, Hop had purchased a quart bottle of " fore leaving the saloon, and it was stowed i*1 0110 4 pockets.	.. ,
The scout looked him over carefully, and notices “What do yer think of him, Wild?” he asked, pc1 at the place where the pocket bulged out.
“I don’t know,” our hero answered, and then ie his revolver from the holster in an off-hauded “Hip hi!” yelled Hop, for he knew well enoug1 was coming.
He had hoped to get the bottle hidden away heiou one noticed it, but he had failed.	i
“Stand a little to the left, Hop,” said Wild, sterfl^
The Chinaman obeyed with alacrity.
Crack!
The young deadshot fired, as quick as a flash*
A stream of liquid flowed down from the pocket, * ing that he had not missed the mark.	. «
“Lafc too bad, Misler Wild,” said Hop, shaking l*is sadly. “Me allee samee feel velly mucliec solly* wantee lillee tanglefoot when me leave Silver Sha ’
be'”	-a
“Oh, you did, eh? Well, why don’t you wait ^
get ready to leave before making a purchase, then? |j
go and clean the broken glass out of your pocket,
give the horses a drink.”
“Allee light, Misler Wild.”
He went off just as meekly as though ho was o& the most innocent Chinamen in the world.	f.
Our friends had seen the Secret Band leave the>nJ,,\; camp, and they were quite sure that they did not' >,,1‘
to go very far.	{t
Wild meant to go out on a little scout around ;l!1 to locate them after he had eaten dinner.	.. jf
As soon as it was ready he. arose and declared ^ (Intentions, advising both Charlie and Jim to remain camp, as it might be that the villainous gang wotf 1^ up and make an attack on them and try to ste** | horses.	i*1
Wild had no difficulty in finding the trail made j ruffians.
He went along as cautiously as though he wa* j band of Apache Indians, for he knew it did not anyway careless.	^ ^
The young deadshot was not long in reaching ^ where the villains had halted before entering ^|Cd- $ gully, and when he looked around lie became Vxl///\]e^ V: “They certainly stopped here,” he muttered, breath. “But where did they go—that's the	^
The ground was- very hard and rocky right * * ^ as the dead tree had fallen across the mouth of ^erl* t concealing it completely, he was not a little lnl2,:.|,1(l *l \* He searched about for the trail, but -failed to r Then he made up his mind that the Tillain^^jv^ right around that particular locality, and he ^ 't1 find where they were.	l^y
If he had only tried to climb over the f*1	^
would have struck it just right; but he f)( it-that there was anything like nn opening >,e ll* -iIj*’1 Instead, he mounted the sid- of the hi” ^ on in an opposite direction to that in w»uc 1 had gone.
The boy looked around for over an hour, and then he *as forced to admit that-lie had struck a tough puzzle.
!; Finally he decided to go and get Charlie to take a hand |*n the search with him.
Back lie went to the camp.
Everything was all right there, and when he told how ^ had lost the trail of the villains Charlie was only too Slfid to go.”
Jim and the girls were in the mine tlie biggest part of the time, watching the work that was going on.
Wild advised them to keep a good watch, for he was now ^ote certain than over that the villains wore lurking a^ut close byr.
^ Me set out with Charlie, and in a little while they f&ched the'spot where the trail was lost.
“Now,” said he, in a low tone, for he did not want to jin'o the villains a chance to hear what he said if they lurking within a short distance, “here we are. What 0JSfou think of it, Charlie ?”
‘I don’t know, Wild,” was the reply. “If you’re puz-C(l 1 don’t see why I wouldn’t be. But since you seem er think they ain’t fur away, B'pose we strike out straight tlier camp from here? It might be that they’re in somewhere.”
I hey climbed up over the broken butt of the fallen tree, discovering the covered gully.
.jU % headed right along in a line that rim almost par-V1' "’ith. it and gradually approached thrf very spot t* ^le v^ains wero *n luring.
were within about a hundred feet of the hin ^le Sully they suddenly saw Hop coming up the from the other side. f0, . Uvo paused and waited for him, Wild motioning 1 him to come without making much noise. tjj 0 picked his way through the bushes with more skill Vu*- n‘^lk he expected for a Chinaman, and soon was ^'hi a dozen yards of them.
Me Jilloo sumee tly to findec where um Scclet Band jj'!5 -Misler Wild,” he said, in a low tone of voice. “Some-'^es me velly muchee smartcc, so be.” j I know that, Hop. You arc ccrtaiuly a very smart ., “Hainan, in some tilings. But I don’t know how you are finding lost trails.” y Me allee light fiudee um lost ttails, Misler Wild. Me j- 7 muchee-”
} e’i'iish !
' ^'-‘fore the Chinaman could finish what he was going f) Sfi,v ho ‘vanished from sight 1 *Jop had dropped right into tho gully.
,l0 ho fall was not more than fifteen feet, and as he rolled t "'n tho steep side he was not injured as badly as he ,,J2ht have been if he took a straight drop, j Charlie was the first to spring forward, for, unlike our i he did not realize that there was some kind of • f,P there.
ran forward, and the first thing he knew he was ?^ing downward.
^,j h; til id down more easily than IIop did, however, and ^lc huided on his feet in tho semi-darkness below ‘OoM around for the Chinaman, hi r thv second time that, day a hlnnket was thrown over H hWul and he was rendered helpless in a jiffy.
"Hip hi!”
He heard the voice of Hop in the distance, and then he knew the Celestial' was running for all he was worth to get away from the villains.
Charlie was quickly carried into the cave by his captors.
They were Con Deckcr, Tom Pike and one of the others, who had helped capture the scout before.
“Go on an’ catch tlier heathen, a couple of 37er!” exclaimed the leader, savagely. “I was jest goin’ ter grab him, when down comes this feller, right inter my arms, almost. Its Young Wild West’s pard! Light out after that heathen, do yer hear? He mustn’t git out of here alive!”
But Hop meant to get out if he could.
Hop could run pretty fast when there was danger behind him.
He reached the dead tree and started to climb over it, just as his pursuers camc in sight.
There were two of them, and one of them, seeing the Chinaman was about to get out, fired at him.
The bullet missed Hop, who uttered another call for Wild, and then bounced out in the clear.
Once there, he made for the biggest tree he could see and got behind it, drawing the hig, old-fashioned revolver he always carried at the same time.
But the villains did not come out.
They were afraid Young Wild West might be there, so they gave up the pursuit and returned to their cave as fast as they could.
Wild was not long in reaching the Chinaman.
“Where is Charlie, Hop?” he asked.
“Seelet Band allee *amee catchee: me lun velly muchee fast and me gittec ’way, so be,” was the reply.
Bidding the Chinaman to make as little noise a*s possible, Wild started along the edge of the gully and made for the place whero Charlie had fallen through.
CHAPTER XVI.
CONCISION.
As he loaned over he hoard low voices below.
“So ther Chinee got away, eh?” he hoard th* leader of the villains say. “Well, (hat moans that we’re in fur a fight, I s’posc. But we'll beat 'em yet! We’ve got one of Young Wild West’s pards, an’ ihcr dirt has caved in at ther hack of ther cave, so we kin look right inter ther mine. There’s two gals in ther mine; an* a man is there, too. Jest as soon as he goes up ter work ther windlass we’ll run in an’ catch ther gals. Then 1 reckon we'll he able ter dictate our own terms with Young Wild West. This is goin’ ter be-”
Wild did not wait to hear anything further.
“Come on, Hop’” he whispered, and then he made up the hill as fast as lie could go.
When he readied the camp he met Dick lirv**#>, \.ho said:
‘The girls are going to load up for mo onr-e. They insisted on doing it, so I let them have ithrir own way.” “Let me down there—quick!” exclaimed Wi! I. ’‘Th ore's danger there!”
The astonished young mimr hardly kr.yv v.hul was
going on when Wild went shooting down the shaft with the bucket.
Crack! A sharp report rang out as the boy readied the bottom and ran toward the two girls, who were standing with a lantern under one of the supporters 9f the gallery.
The young deadshot reeled, and, staggering forward, fell in the arms of Arietta!
In came half a dozen of the Secret Band, one of them wearing a miner’s lamp on his hat.
Wild was lying on the ground, unconscious, for the bullet had grazed his head and narrowly missed killing him.
Arietta knelt at his side, supporting his head with her arm.	,
Suddenly she heard a defiant shriek from Sallie Bacon, and then a yell went up from the villains.
Arietta looked up and saw a can, which she knew must contain nitro-glycerine, standing close by, and Sallie was pointing at it, while she faced the villains in the mine.
“Is he dead ?” the girl asked, looking at Arietta.
Arietta shook her head, signifying that she feared the worst.
The Mine Girl thought that Young Wild West was surely dead, and, seizing a pick, she rushed for the can of riitro-glyeerme to explode it and scud them all to death.
“Don’t!” cried Arietta, while the villains yelled in dismay.
Uttering a piercing shriek, Sallie brought down the pick.
The men ran in terror.
Rip—thud!
The sharp pick hit* the can, penetrated it and stuck in the ground.
The can proved to be empty!
At the same moment down came the shaft bucket with Jim and Bryan in it.
They had scarcely landed when Hop came sliding down the rope.
He had heard as much as Wild had, and he knew the villains were close by.
While Jim and Biyan rushed to the side of Wild, Hop 'bounded through the only passage he could see, and the first thing he knew he stumbled into the cave, which had been deserted by the Secret Band in their fit of terror.
‘‘Hello, Misler Charlie!” he said, speaking soft)}'.
A muffled sound came from his right, and, dropping up his hands and knees, he crawled over.
He came upon the helpless scout right away, and a quick ptroke of his knife and Charlie was free.
I»>i!<. in hand., the scout darted out of the cave, while flop went hack into the mine.
(’rang! He heard the report of the scout’s rifle and Hop knew that one <»f the Secret Band was no more.
( ran" ! Again the rifle spoke.
“‘Misier Charlie velly muchec mad, so be,”* muttered the Cel'-stiai. as he shook his head.
Jim had discovered that the wound was not a dangerous one, and soon had Wild upon his feet.
“Great Scottl'* the young deadshot gasped. “What i9 up, anyhow? I never felt so funny in all my life!”
“You jjff*t stunned, Wild,” Jim hastened to say. “You are all right now.”	N
Crang—erang! Two more shots rang out just then. “Ah! I remember it all now!” our hero exclaimed-Give me my rifle, Et! I must be in at the finish!”
She gave it to him, and away he dashed, with' Jim.
The rest hurriedly got out into the open air, leaving Arietta alone in the cave.
“Wild !” she called out, presently.
“It is all right, Et,” came the reassuring reply. “AVe have all that is left of them. Charlie dropped six of them in four shots, so it seems. Here are the rest.’ The next minute Wild and Charlie appeared, leading two men.
One was Con Decker himself and the other was th& villain called Tom Pike.
The gully being so narrow, the scout had literal1-: mowed them down.
A stream of blood was running down the side of oia* hero’s head, and, noticing it, Arietta quickly tied hi* handkerchief about the wound.
“I don’t know who it was who fired that cowardly shot, but he came mighty near fixing me,” said Wild.
“If it will do yer any good ter know who done it, I’H tell yer,” spoke up Con Dec-ker. “I was ther one what fired it, an’ I’m only sorry that it didn’t kill yer dead!” f “Well, you won’t he sorry very long, I reckon,” was the reply. “The boys have got a rope ready for you, I guess.”
They all went up out of the mine, and then Wild said • ■ “Now we’ll take the two prisoners down and report*
boy*”	^
Blit only Charlie went along with him.	,.
Half an hour later Wild and Charlie returned 1° 1 camp.
“It’s all over,” said the scout, laconically, as he took ft bite from a piece of tobacco. “Now I reckon ther niin111 an’ lovemakin’ between ther Mine Gal an’ her workn^11 kin go on. Whoopee!”*
This about finishes our story.
We might add, however, that a couple of weeks hil°l Dick Bryan and Sallie Bacon ■were made man and "l l> though out friends did not remain to witness the ceic mony.
They sold the mine a little later and went to Calif°r , nia.	,
But if it had not been for Young Wihl West t chances are that the Mine Girl’s life would never ha'^ been brightened by romance and riches, for he surely h<l-.' saved her from the Secret Band of Silver Shaft. 5
THE END.
