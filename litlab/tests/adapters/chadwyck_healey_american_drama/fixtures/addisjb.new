<pdiv><speech><speaker>Eliza.</speaker><fullform>Mrs. Elizabeth Marchant</fullform><p><pl ln="3">Ah! my dear, you may well ask how; it will make</pl>
<pl ln="4">a great many folks wonder. It was but last summer, when</pl>
<pl ln="5">I persuaded your good papa, on a plea of ill health, to take</pl>
<pl ln="6">us to Saratoga. We went there in style; we endeavored to</pl>
<pl ln="7">exceed all the common upstarts&mdash;a splendid carriage with</pl>
<pl ln="8">Irish drivers and footmen, up to their middle in regimentals.</pl>
<pl ln="9">I kept up the <hi r="italic">ton</hi>&mdash;went to parties and balls&mdash;lost money</pl>
<pl ln="10">at hazard&mdash;awakened every morning with the headache&mdash;</pl>
<pl ln="11">did everything which I suppose a lady of fashion should do;</pl>
<pl ln="12">made the acquaintance of Mrs. Dasher, Brilliant, and Swellpride,</pl>
<pl ln="13">of this place&mdash;left them my cards&mdash;and what was the</pl>
<pl ln="14">consequence? Was I admired, f&ecirc;ted, entertained, as a lady</pl>
<pl ln="15">of fortune and quality should be? My very maid, the</pl>
<pl ln="16">huzzy, one morning, when I boxed her ears, told me that I</pl>
<pl ln="17">was vulgar&mdash;that I had been a pie woman&mdash;that my husband</pl>
<pl ln="18">was a quack doctor&mdash;that ladies of fashion only indulged,</pl>
<pl ln="19">and never entertained me. Oh! vexation, if I utter</pl>
<pb n="4">
<pl ln="20">more I'll choke. When Lady Splasher gave her rout I was</pl>
<pl ln="21">not invited&mdash;none of them have left their cards&mdash;we are</pl>
<pl ln="22">despised. No, we are not despised, we are envied. I</pl>
<pl ln="23">despise them. I am a millionaire. I can afford to be a</pl>
<pl ln="24">philosopher, and hate 'em.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker>Leona.</speaker><fullform>Leonora</fullform><p><pl ln="25">Yes; but mamma, you remarked you would be a</pl>
<pl ln="26">happy woman at last; your conversation does not make me</pl>

<pdiv><speech><speaker>Eliza.</speaker><fullform>Mrs. Elizabeth Marchant</fullform><p><pl ln="28">True, I have tattled on too fast; my injuries will</pl>
<pl ln="29">sometimes involuntarily make use of my tongue. You</pl>
<pl ln="30">know Lord Fitzgerald, do you not, the new lion in fashionable</pl>
<pl ln="31">society?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>

<pdiv><speech><speaker>Eliza.</speaker><fullform>Mrs. Elizabeth Marchant</fullform><p><pl ln="34">Well, my dear, when his lordship first visited</pl>
<pl ln="35">this place, he created a furor&mdash;fashionable society was enchanted&mdash;</pl>
<pl ln="36">a noble ancestry&mdash;his name a history&mdash;his lineage</pl>
<pl ln="37">spotless&mdash;by birth itself, all that can be desired&mdash;combining</pl>
<pl ln="38">the suavity of the gentleman, with the charming impudence</pl>
<pl ln="39">of the man of the world; he was courted by the women,</pl>
<pl ln="40">and feasted by the men; the votaries of fashion could make</pl>
<pl ln="41">their fortune by his smile. Mrs. Highflyer and Mrs. Swellpride</pl>
<pl ln="42">attempted to engross him themselves; he was idolized</pl>
<pl ln="43">by all, and the upper ten thousand were nobody, unless</pl>
<pl ln="44">they were noticed by him. Of course, I sent a liveried servant</pl>
<pl ln="45">with my card, and what was the consequence? in</pl>
<pl ln="46">despite of Mrs. Lady Swellpride, or Mrs. Highflyer, he paid</pl>
<pl ln="47">us a visit.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker>Leona.</speaker><fullform>Leonora</fullform><p><pl ln="48">Well, ma! what of that?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker>Eliza.</speaker><fullform>Mrs. Elizabeth Marchant</fullform><p><pl ln="49">Well, my dear, all these fashionable leaders whom</pl>
<pl ln="50">I despise so much, were immediately on their knees at my</pl>
<pl ln="51">feet, and I triumphed.</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker>Leona.</speaker><fullform>Leonora</fullform><p><pl ln="52">Well, my dear ma, what did you triumph over?</pl></p></speech></pdiv>
<pdiv><speech><speaker>Eliza.</speaker><fullform>Mrs. Elizabeth Marchant</fullform><p><pl ln="53">Oh! my sweet Lee&mdash;if you were not so pretty,</pl>
<pl ln="54">I would pull your ear, you are always so strange; but to be</pl>
<pl ln="55">short, I triumphed over spite, envy, and pride&mdash;and despite</pl>
<pl ln="56">the fat daughters of the widow Rumple&mdash;the old maids out</pl>
<pl ln="57">Chestnut St., and the aristocratic family of the Snubems,</pl>

<pl ln="65">She wrote several dissertations upon that subject, and</pl>
<pl ln="66">had them printed at <hi r="italic">her own</hi> expense. At a card party, one</pl>

<pl ln="85">in the world&mdash;at least in the world's estimation; it</pl>
<pl ln="86">can be illustrated: for instance, if a rich man fails, ruining</pl>
<pl ln="87">many people, he has only failed; he becomes a lion, his</pl>

<pl ln="128">to be tried. Intending to do something in their aid, I accompanied</pl>

<pl ln="130">had already commenced. A fine&hyphen;looking young lawyer</pl>
